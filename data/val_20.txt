I remember listening to the shape of the equation , " If you have to explain it , it does n't have any effect . "
And I woke up a day and said , " If that 's wrong ? "
So here 's my explanation on the left .
And it says , " Well , it 's impossible .
It 's usually a bad quote to the <unk> .
And this does n't have any <unk> . "
I 'm talking about my own mind , right ?
That 's what you 're never going to do .
" Maybe maybe the text can build images , but not anything he does .
So what 's the core of poetry ?
If you want to be serious , do n't get <unk> .
What do you do with the chaos of chaos ?
And I guess anyone can <unk> the idea , and you can explain " <unk> " through " The old age . "
So I 'm going to show you a painting -- you should remember my old old year , right ?
And I found it to use it .
So there 's a couple of schemes that I think that this is not true , and it 's <unk> -- " but even more visual . "
What might really want to say is aging and openness , <unk> , connection . "
And then more self - reflection -- " Am I simple ?
Is it obvious that simple , it seems very glamorous ?
There 's a major difference .
It would be quite crazy .
In fact , I found that fear fear was like any kind of license drive that drove me .
Do you think that really will attract a student to school ?
<unk> , I think there are two new things -- two things .
One is -- in front of the <unk> of <unk> , this is not what I 'm doing , and it 's not something I 've done .
As you know , you have to have a direction to face .
I mean , you have to do confidence . If you do n't believe what you 're doing , who would you think ?
So this is the first one , some of the ideas that will come to the graphics .
That 's a big contribution .
Another thing is that it gives you two solutions , and you can pick up this big , if you do n't like that , then how small ?
That 's a new idea .
There 's a range of experiments , and I asked a question -- who must be square ?
And that 's some things .
That suffering is not folded .
It 's not folded , it 's a photo which is taken on the wing .
That 's the same trick on the upper left left .
This is a very boring guy , because it 's only because of the computer of computers , not frozen .
Sometimes , like <unk> , it changes .
If you sit down here enough , it 's going to leave the page on the page .
But we do n't have time .
And then another experiment -- it 's a little bit about <unk> , and its edge shape is shaped by <unk> forces , but the shape of the edges looks more much more frequently .
The other thing for <unk> <unk> was Anna <unk> .
That 's not the poster of the visual arts .
There are 10 artists who are invited to make this , which is a lot of competition , and I do n't want to dive into <unk> , so I 'm very challenging to work .
And the idea is -- this is a good idea -- it 's going to paste 10 to the whole city of the city , so that every time it goes into the subway , each one has a different understanding of what art is .
But I was completely immersed in the idea of " Art " and to try to figure out what art is .
But then I gave up and I thought , " Things are art . "
And when I realized that <unk> , I found the word " <unk> " in words , " which is going to lead me to this conclusion .
But again , it became one of my sons .
I want to tell you a little bit about the <unk> , and you ca n't understand it .
And here 's what it says : " <unk> <unk> -- I think I might use the visual <unk> of the time , <unk> , to express art and lifelong and historic and early history .
And I 'm also sure that the <unk> of the computer has become <unk> , and it becomes a shadow of a shadow of <unk> .
And this phrase " Knowledge is the " <unk> " of the art of art , " which is not something that you do n't want to create , but the way you create it . "
The <unk> of the <unk> , when the shadow of this fence -- when this compressed shadow is <unk> in the word " <unk> " in words , it 's the same thing that makes art to be defined as an object , and the values of things , or things -- things like the things that are in a matter of matter .
Whatever .
Okay .
Next is a painting I did n't <unk> , but I was still like . I wanted to use the same trick .
In a few years ago , <unk> had done a fabulous experiment about the letters of letters -- looking at what you 're still going to see .
And the idea went to my brain .
But then I <unk> on the top of the underside of the underside .
And of course , they 're <unk> and very glamorous .
But what you 're actually going to read is -- " Art is anything that is <unk> . "
Thank you .
<unk>
The film has been played with the film that he made , " The movie " <unk> , which is a emotional and rich , rich and generous film .
Africa , arts , creativity , culture , entertainment , film , global issues , war
<unk>
<unk> <unk> tells stories from <unk>
And this is very strange for me , because I do n't use that same talk , usually , I 'm standing on the other side , and I feel like I 've given someone 's pressure , which is n't very glamorous .
I think one of the first things that I 've been doing before is a nice <unk> -- this is about the force behind my work , my motivation , and I 'm going to lose answers to the answer and try and search for those problems .
But this is true for me , and I mean , I 'm going to talk to you about the talk , feel like -- there 's a portrait that I really love to live in France and learn about a couple of years after the French , who ask him , what do you create ?
How do you leave that for years ?
And he took a couple of titles to them .
The other person is n't satisfied : " Are you doing this for a few years ? "
And what we expect is to see " <unk> , " and you 're <unk> . "
But what I 'm going to do is understand that the smaller object is an exploration , the idea of thinking , and everything , everything is just <unk> .
In some sense , I feel something .
I think I would go home and talk about what I did in 20 years .
And I 'm going to start with some of my work , and I have the work of <unk> films , and I have a couple films and some films .
Let 's start with the first video .
Video : <unk> lives , the mother says .
I love her , you know .
She does n't even have my mother .
My mother disappeared , and I went to Nigeria .
And the <unk> came in .
sleep sleeping .
Are you here ?
Where ?
Nigeria
There never happened .
My mother wants to go to my mother , but I 'm going to <unk> .
I hope I will go .
I <unk> really happy here .
Why would everyone leave me ?
I do n't want to leave you .
You do n't need me .
But you ca n't see it .
What do you do today ?
Read read .
Are you telling you ?
Why do n't you find it ?
I was busy .
What about that ?
And I 've been trying to fight for the rest of the country , and I 'm going to live for myself .
No , you 're a guy who looks like a homeless man .
And I like it .
<unk> , read your <unk> .
They do n't give you <unk> .
Read my mind and soul .
<unk> , for you , <unk> me .
You 're <unk> <unk> ? Right ?
1427
modern poets .
Well , that 's okay .
So what do you say ?
What does that mean ?
Simple . What do you do ?
<unk> , brothers .
Who 's the reality of that ?
My lost .
Tell me your reality .
<unk> , <unk> depression , like people like me were alive .
So what do you have a good way ? I mean , let 's do it as a job , just like a brother , and a brothers , but it 's a very simple thing to fight .
Do it with a 47 <unk> ?
And if I have , you 've got to say , yeah , I 'm going to have it .
How many <unk> are you 27 years old ?
<unk> , you know what I mean .
When it comes down , it says that he does n't have the ability to understand himself .
You 're going to see you now , right now .
That 's the <unk> of America .
What about the Indians ?
These people , the people who are white , white men , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
This is <unk> . I 've seen films , too bad . Why ?
I saw him the last movie .
It 's <unk> , right ?
1427
It 's not saying that he does n't work , it 's an extension sensation .
[ <unk> ] <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , tired .
Can you do that ?
Now , what do you say to me , my film ?
Yeah .
<unk> .
<unk> ? So what ?
What , what , why ?
How do you feel that film ?
And my film is , okay , good .
They 're not going to show you much more than that .
What do you say ?
How do you leave the real content in the face of a Hollywood charity ?
You make the audiences .
Yves <unk>
Newton : Thank you . My first video is really trying to figure out what 's going on in the film , where I come from the cinema ?
The first clip is that a young woman talked about Chile , she thinks she 's happy .
This is intimacy from home .
It 's a experience that I experience , and it 's in experience .
And I have a good day , and I 've got five years old .
I 've got 20 years on my day .
So this is the worst date of the <unk> of Nigeria in 1997 , when it 's a <unk> period .
For this girl , we have this dream of dreams that we need to love .
It 's a little romantic , but I think it 's beautiful because you just have a special thing in social society .
And this brings us to the next video , a young man who says , in Europe , the <unk> of the winter , and we all know that it 's going to talk about his real real experience .
And again , this is where I 'm talking about the richness of England in England , and what I want to say is that this term of cultural culture is in real life .
And one of the ways that a young child has a thought like a writer , and I mean , his heart <unk> <unk> .
What 's going to happen ?
And of course , the result is that violence , this is what we say about the Jews , we talk about <unk> , L.A. and so forth , and in the end of the year , I 've got a riot that has been developed in France , which is just like <unk> .
I lived in England for 18 years .
And in France , I felt like a period of time when I went to the French age for 20 years .
And look at the third video . So , it 's the question , which is this question : What is the movie for you ? What do you want to do with film ?
There 's a young director , and the director of the Hollywood community , with his friends , talked about the importance of film .
And I think that 's the way I do this , and it 's a movie that I 'm doing .
When I was born at the age of 1966 , it was a <unk> war in 2007 , a couple of years of war wars , three years old .
All of a sudden , all of my memories started to take me on the next step .
<unk> : Yeah , with the younger siblings .
<unk> , mother .
The soldiers , you 're going to get to fight , and you have to do it .
You have to have you guys .
<unk> preparation , preparation .
success , change through <unk> can achieve .
By <unk> .
This is the guy .
That 's the list .
That 's a <unk> . This is your life .
That 's your life . This is , yeah , that 's what you are .
They let us eat a special drug . We call a bubble .
<unk>
<unk> , bruised , soldier .
<unk> , bruised , soldier .
We came from a village to another village , three villages .
And I do n't know how to go there .
We got two days .
Nothing .
No food , only a few bears .
No food , no food .
We 've got the license plate .
God will forgive us .
And he knows we did n't know . We did n't know .
Do you remember a June June in 1999 ?
I do n't remember .
You die . You 'll die .
<unk> : Yeah .
♫ We do n't need much more trouble : ♫ Do n't more problems ♫ They kill my mom .
<unk> <unk> on <unk>
Who is she ?
It 's me .
Why do you give me these ?
So you 're not looking at me .
I 'm a little bit more complex .
I want to hear that .
She 's got a baby .
Do you know what you 're ? The <unk> ?
Yves <unk>
In <unk> , you 're not going to die .
And he did n't have his military anymore .
<unk> , last time , <unk> .
Your eyes , please .
And the <unk> looked at his pocket , and the diamond came in .
♫ We do n't need much more trouble !
And I think you 're going to work out the way .
I 'm going to give you here .
You have your girlfriend .
Good job , good fun .
And that 's why you 're here , right ?
You go back to war , right ?
♫ We do n't need much more trouble ! ♫ Do n't even more problems ♫ ♫ Are n't more the trouble : ♫ No problem , you 're not going to have a lot of problems .
♫ We do n't need much more ... ♫ And we want , in your relationship with other people , to try and understand what 's going on .
It 's much more <unk> , and ultimately it 's going to end the country 's history .
I hope that starts .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
Tell the temple and your age .
My name is <unk> <unk> .
I was 15 or 16 , and I remember <unk> .
My sister , she 's a <unk> ; she <unk> .
And he 's 16 years old , and I want to remind you , you 're not going to <unk> you right now .
Our freedom for our freedom .
If the war in war is <unk> , you have to <unk> all the soldiers in the world .
War is <unk> , yes , but I never came to war .
You 're also a Swiss <unk> , right ?
Yeah , right .
And you have to <unk> .
Our government fell <unk> .
<unk> education is the way they control power .
And I thought , well , what do you need to pay ?
No , we do n't need it .
You are more rich than us .
We need to pay for education .
Your country is <unk> democracy , but you have to support corruption , for example , our government .
Why ? Because you want our diamond .
Can you ask anyone here , he 's seen a diamond ?
No .
And Mr. <unk> , I want to remind you , you 're not here today .
You 're not in <unk> .
That would me .
I ca n't do that . Child .
So you 're lying .
Newton : Thank you . I 'm going to tell you a little bit about my point , which is that when we 've done what we do , I think we should think about Africa .
Thank you .
<unk> : Thank you , Newton .
A emotional theme is a very strong theme that we see in a little bit of resistance , the younger generation , and they 're kids , they are <unk> .
Think about where you are , when we realize that they 're not going to have the harm of harm ?
<unk> : In the process of my research , I actually spent some time researching this research .
And I remember that I had a lot of money in the soldiers , and they liked it .
And I 've met their <unk> .
I 've got a lot of time in their lives , <unk> , NGOs , lots of people , lots of people .
But I remember going to go back to the last last film , and remember , I would remember that if these kids , if they were a child in Western countries , then if any child was in the West , they had a lifetime of life , only a day of the day .
So in my opinion , for all of these kids , this is the generation , we have the whole generation of young people who have suffered so badly that a severe disaster has to withstand themselves .
And I hope that they 're going to be able to do it when we 've done a great achievement of what we 're doing .
This is my real idea .
<unk> : So we 're going to thank you again .
This is a shared shared sharing .
Newton : Thank you .
<unk> : Thank you .
<unk>
In the end of the <unk> of Richard <unk> , the architect of <unk> <unk> and the audience shares how powerful it is , and what 's the most important thing about it , " How ? "
architecture , arts , business , creativity , culture , design , innovation , invention
13
<unk> : And what about that ?
<unk> : I heard a scientist today today .
<unk> invites me to tell his experiment , and suddenly he thinks it 's a scientist .
When I was a kid , my parents bought me a chemical cell . And then I decided to paint it .
So I did a whole series of layers of oxygen , a oxygen <unk> . I came up with a leopard , and I went into a <unk> and then I threw <unk> in .
And then the glass -- fortunately I went down , all over the back of my hand , and it 's about <unk> .
And that 's a -- you know .
I built a <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah ? Really ?
<unk> : Everyone 's all over the street to door to door , looking at me .
.
JH : Well , I 'm going to <unk> this conversation .
And this gentleman on the left is very famous , and maybe a little boy <unk> .
So you 've got an incredible amount of height .
I mean , for a artist -- an architect -- a time to become an <unk> , even <unk> .
I mean , you 've succeeded , even though it 's really funny -- you know , this is a strange idea . But your buildings are <unk> , but you have the <unk> of <unk> stars , it can be used in most of the time .
And I know that this is very tough .
And all of the sacrifices you 've made , however , is enormous .
You work for the lives of others .
But this is interesting for anyone who is very creative .
There 's a lot of people who have spent on others , our lives in other people .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> -- we 're in a period of time -- this is the biggest moral challenge of creativity , and how it 's going to be self - sufficient .
And you do it . This gives you the milk -- even more winning .
It 's not a problem , but you can talk about your thinking .
It 's important .
<unk> : Yeah , I 've just been -- anyway .
I never found a job .
I 'm sitting there .
At first , I think the building is <unk> business , and you have to call the <unk> and your team .
And I realized that I was walking out of the room with the <unk> metal and the wind , and people would look at me when I came back from Mars .
But there 's nothing else to do .
That 's my response to people and that time .
In fact , that 's my responses to my manager , and they 're not glamorous , so they ca n't be very good .
I think that 's also the same time .
You know I have to make my house , and I 've got a car .
We came up with a hundred million dollars in <unk> , which was built in about five dollars .
Some people were excited .
I worked with a artists , Michael <unk> , in a desert stadium .
And he 's building a huge <unk> building in there .
This evening was a little bit late , and we had a lot of wine .
And we 're standing in big deserts , and he says -- think about my house -- he said , " You do n't think you 're going to get more <unk> , in the summer , to the future . "
So I think -- yeah , maybe a good idea .
And I was lucky , and then I found some <unk> managers , so my work could become a little <unk> .
And then I found that the world would never be close to you , so that 's what the guy told us .
So what do we do ?
Let 's go back to -- well , that 's all right .
I do n't see the world .
For me , every day is new .
I was all over the way to the new project , for every project for me to deal with my first project . I 've got <unk> , and I do n't know how it 's going to happen .
If I can predict or plan , I wo n't continue .
I 'm going to stop the projection or plans .
So I can take the same <unk> to every project .
But , of course , my confidence is in time , so everything will happen .
I 'm really working on a business business , and I have 120 people who spend a lot of money for everybody who 's paid for each person , which is a very responsible job for the project .
As this guy said , I could say he could n't be sure .
When I finished it , I looked at it and I watched all the mistakes .
They ca n't be a mistake . I look at everything I can change .
And I felt like , " What do you do ?
How do I put that shape like this , or how to do that ?
I have to look at it , and I 'm going to see it in the corner of the building , but when you walk into the earthquake corner , there 's a place where there is a corner and a street and it looks a little bit like a building .
JH : What about New York ?
<unk> : I do n't know .
Tom <unk> makes me look at me and went to me , and I thought he was a <unk> .
And I think he did n't know what he was doing , but he got it .
So I think he 's the founder of <unk> and conservatives .
He 's got a very high effort -- and then it goes .
People are still doing it now .
And over the course of nine , there are some people who put it into the <unk> idea , and I 'm the hands of my hands .
<unk> <unk> makes me feel very comfortable about what 's going on on the top . This is what I 've done .
JH : This painting on the screen is Doug Engelbart .
<unk> : Yeah .
JH : How many of you do it ?
<unk> : May come in in 2003 , or October , I hope <unk> , <unk> and all these musician can play with us .
Very lucky , I 'm working with people who are working together , most of my favorites .
Richard <unk> may be a lot of <unk> <unk> , find me why .
He always looks like a <unk> .
And that project did n't depend on architecture , because the financial crisis ...
You know , imagine this world , even in front of the audience , most of us are connected to buildings .
You ca n't think of them as architecture , right ?
So you find somebody like this , and you get , you know ?
He became leaders in art , and there was a project of <unk> <unk> .
I know <unk> and <unk> him .
They want to increase what 's going to happen . It 's a very nice building in this building . This is a beautiful , <unk> <unk> building , and Richard wants to <unk> a library and a lot of <unk> .
I persuaded him to take me on another architect , <unk> <unk> .
JH : Why want him to join him ?
<unk> : I know you 'll ask this question .
It 's just an exaggeration .
<unk> : And <unk> <unk> was born in Portugal , and there was still been been recognized in front of the harbor .
I went to visit him a few years ago , and he showed me his early paintings . His early work had a little bit of similar work .
When I graduated from school , I started trying to figure out something that came out of the <unk> , and you could think of Spanish as the Spanish Age of Spain .
I understood that the language of this kind of language as a springboard to be a pop - up , and there 's a lot of <unk> built in <unk> .
So I stopped .
I mean , Charlie Moore does a lot of similar things , but I ca n't be attracted .
<unk> , in Portugal , came up with a modern language in the Portugal language .
I always thought he could go to California .
I 'm trying to get some projects , but not successful .
And I like to cooperate with people like this , because this is a good idea because of this collaboration .
I 've been collaborating with <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and they 're not going to think of architecture as art .
Do you notice ?
<unk> : How did he say that ?
<unk> : It 's called " <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> : Ooh , dear collaboration .
It 's more expensive experience .
Like a <unk> and other musician , I think , is a feeling of <unk> cooperation , and you -- yeah , right ?
Audience : A building .
<unk> : A dust .
It 's like <unk> -- you can <unk> , you 're going to challenge each other . You 've got something .
I think this is a way -- it 's an understanding of a city , and what happens when this city will happen .
<unk> : Do n't you ?
Or it will be ...
<unk> : No , it 's on the road .
Anyway , he 's a customer .
And of course , that 's not his money .
JH : What is his plan ?
<unk> : And I do n't know .
What plans , Richard ?
Richard <unk> : 2004 .
<unk> : 2004 .
You can come to <unk> , and I 'll invite you .
No , but the city of democracy is interesting because it will cause chaos , right ?
Everybody would have a very chaotic situation , and if you could get rid of each other -- I mean , it 's not -- you can find a whole bunch of people who are able to engage the city with a bold competition , not just about a architect .
It 's like the <unk> center model , as a consequence .
JH : I found the most important thing for me .
And I think it 's a fantastic building for <unk> , and then there 's remarkable space .
I saw you in the <unk> of TED .
And the surprising thing about <unk> is that it 's adaptive in other cities .
That 's the end of the ice , and the neighborhood goes around and goes down and forth and suddenly the surprises for us .
And that 's what I did .
<unk> : But you know , Richard , when most architects show their work -- we know that most of you , we 're going to stand up and talk about your work , just like telling everybody you 're a good , to say , " Look , I 've been thinking about the problem . "
This one , that 's all that .
It 's like it 's <unk> .
It 's like , you know , those are the things that can be done , and that can be done .
And I think everyone -- I mean , I 'm supposed to do it like gravity .
You ca n't deny the presence of gravity , or <unk> it .
You have to cooperate with projects .
And if you have a lot of work , you get a lot of projects .
If you have biotech -- no competition .
Let me be proud of it .
MIT 's project -- they 're going to have a lot of money for me .
I 've met them in the <unk> .
They spent three days .
JH : This is the computer building ?
<unk> : Yeah , computers building .
They 've got three days of it , and they 're going to get them out of the place and see what they are doing in the bottom , always looking at what 's going on .
People have to be missed .
I 'm going to be <unk> . That 's where <unk> , <unk> . That 's great .
But you have to -- yes , no longer the house would have a problem .
JH : Yves .
<unk> : Go <unk> .
<unk> : Well , an <unk> -- a few months later , he 's in the Los Angeles Institute .
<unk> : You 've heard of the story of Frank <unk> 's story , and when a woman says , " Mr. <unk> , I was lying in my head .
And he said , " Doc , you should be approaching a chair . "
I was doing another project on the beach , and I came up with a little house in the beaches of beach . His secretary , his girlfriend , who said , " Duke 's going to sit in his head . "
I 'm telling her the story of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : She did n't laugh .
<unk> : Yeah , it 's not .
I mean , I could n't say that , " What about it ? "
Well , you 've solved all the questions that you do , and you 're doing good things . You love your your cousin ; you love that cities -- you are a good guy .
What about that ?
What do you get ?
That 's what I 've been interested in -- a personal expression .
And so I think , as I say , you can have your own personal expression , and all the fundamental conditions of the city .
This reminds me to think about the " <unk> . "
And I think that 's the point , and you know , it 's like , " Well , what 's going to spread all of the people who join the architect is not for that architect .
And the architect came to the project 's project , and it 's a good thing to say , so they do n't understand the values of a architect .
In a period of time , some years ago , people were very popular at the <unk> .
<unk> : I did a teapot , but nobody could buy my <unk> .
JH : It 's out there ?
<unk> : There is no .
So today , people want to have the design of Michael <unk> .
People want to do that kind of design for the <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah , I always have that call .
When you open open - open -- it 's about <unk> now , and I 've got a lot of calls -- I do n't know so much about it , I 'm not sure , at least 100 percent of the Chinese , in the Brazilian , there 's also a <unk> of what 's going on in China .
And I 've seen some of them .
And usually , I 've never been rejected , but some people have got a tree , and they 're very good at it , they 've got it .
And one of the teams that I had to do with the whole team goes to 280 , because there 's all sorts of <unk> and <unk> -- you know -- a very religious city who wants me to build building a building building an building .
I asked them what .

Four people together .
And they took a long day , and we made a very good hotel and took us to see the bay and they showed us the <unk> landscape .
And everywhere , very beautiful .
And then then the <unk> would have lunch with the mayor of <unk> and <unk> , and in <unk> .
And before we go to lunch , we went to see the <unk> of the temple .
This is a piece of paper that goes on the table , sitting there and sit there , and I 'm here with my people .
And we sat down , and we drink the water .
And that person looked at me and said , " Can I do something for you , <unk> ? "
JH : Oh , Jesus .
<unk> : So I stood up .
Tell me , " Let 's go . "
We stand up and down .
They follow up -- that person goes through us , and said , " Are you not going to eat with the mayor ? "
And I said , " <unk> . "
" Do you do n't get to dinner ? "
They 're just going to get us out there , and you 've got a lot of money to make a project .
So we did that .
And I 've got a lot of old old ones , and I could n't do it .
I do n't have a personal airplane .
JH : I 'm going to get out of the way , which is the end , because it 's enough .
I said , " <unk> . "
<unk> : Can I say that ?
You do n't want to say that I 'm your own .
JH : dog help !
<unk> : I 'm also a human , trying to experience the experience of experience .
JH : Yeah , sure , there 's opportunity . No forget about it .
JH : I 'm going to give you a ticket .
<unk> : No , no , wait .

<unk> <unk> talks about the economy of the monkeys
I want to start with these two visions of human species .
And the first phenomenon that you might think is very obvious that this is that our species <unk> , actually , is really very , very smart , as you can do right now .
And of course , it 's not the first time you realize this .
And of course , besides smart , we are very <unk> species .
So we like to point out that we 're smart .
You know , I can explain that <unk> <unk> or Stephen <unk> describes a truth , which is that we 're rational , and when it comes to <unk> , it 's the Earth 's best .
But , of course , I 'm much more hopeful to focus on the second phenomenon of human beings , but in fact , we really are really smart , sometimes at the same time , and sometimes we sometimes make decisions .
I saw many of you in the room .
Do n't worry about that , I 'm not suggesting any of you who make a mistake .
But , of course , in the last two years , we 've seen a lot of examples that we have never seen before .
We 've seen that we use a special tool to try and break resources from the environment , like suddenly , from our face .
We 've also seen that we 're creating a special <unk> , which is the <unk> of our eye .
But I think it 's not the most <unk> example of the human being , and we might be more likely to think that these mistakes are more like a couple of years , or a few errors in the blog .
But in fact , <unk> thinks that most of us are in a certain context , most people do some very specific mistakes .
And what we do is we make these false mistakes .
We 're always making the same mistakes .
And for many evidence .
When we get negative feedback , it 's always the same wrong thing when we 've got the pain .
So I feel suspicious , as a research for the human nature .
And the most curious thing is , what do we do as a very clever species , why do n't we make so bad mistakes ?
You know , we 're the most clever , why do n't we answer this question ?
What is wrong with our mistakes ?
When I think about it , I feel a little bit different .
The first possibility is that it 's not our fault .
Because we 're smart species , we can actually create a lot of very complex environmental , complex environments , and sometimes we ca n't understand it .
We created a very complex meme .
It does n't work with yourself .
And of course , if we ca n't engage the environment in a certain way , it 's our own <unk> .
And if you do that , we can easily solve these people wrong .
We can say , okay , let 's take the technology we ca n't accept , and the bad conditions , to abandon them , we need to become the kind of <unk> species that we expect .
But I 'm more worried about another possibility , which is , maybe not bad .
Maybe the problem is that we 're not designing ourselves .
This is a challenge that I 've seen from looking at the human mind .
I know people will make mistakes over and over again .
It 's like we 're going to do it in a certain way .
And that 's probably what I 'm worried about , because if we 're in our own reasons , it 's much more important .
We might only accept this fact , and that 's what we 're going to be wrong with , in the process of design .
So this is a question of me and my students .
How do we tell the difference between these two possibilities ?
We need a clever , a lot of decisions , but with our system -- that 's where we 're going to get rid of anything like <unk> , no human culture , the human cultures , maybe even human languages .
That 's why we study them .
This is one of my work . It 's brown .
They 're called <unk> <unk> , which means they 're already collecting out of <unk> years ago .
So , you 've been given once once . The grandmother is probably about twice a million weeks , and it 's going to be the same for tens of millions .
And that 's what we can do with this guy who we are really , really careful with us .
The good news about <unk> is that she does n't have a technology .
You know , she 's smart , very cute little animal , and she does n't have anything that we ca n't understand .
So she should be an appropriate experiment .
What if we put <unk> in the same context ?
Would she make the same mistakes for us ?
Are n't she telling me ? And so on .
These are the questions we want to learn .
I was expecting this experiment for a few years ago .
And we said , let 's lose a bunch of people in the world , look at what she 's doing .
The first question is , is that , from where ?
Because the experiment is good for us , but it 's hard to be human .
We have different errors in different realms .
So what do we do ?
At the beginning of the <unk> , it 's also the same news that 's going to happen in the dictionary , and we think , perhaps , maybe we 're starting to start with the foundations .
Let 's look at the monkeys in the economy , looking at whether they 're making the same mistakes that we 're doing .
And of course , the second question is that the problem is , you may not know , monkeys is using tomato sauce . You 're not talking about monkeys and advertisers .
So this is why you 're in the grocery store or the <unk> , without seeing the monkeys , and they do n't do that .
So we 've got a little bit of a problem here .
If the monkeys does n't have money , how do you get monkeys ?
And we 're like , okay , a little bit of a song , and let 's start with a monkey .
So we did .
And so you see this little thing that I have on my hand , and I know that the first <unk> of social currencies .
There 's nothing more creative about this research , so it 's called it .
We 're teaching monkeys to use monkeys using these <unk> and human beings , to buy different fruit .
It does n't look very glamorous , actually .
And as we did , it uses metal .
And as you walk into all sorts of <unk> , you go to home , and when you get to the house , it 's too much that you can get out of it .
And before the monkeys understood what to do , they do n't do anything with them .
And when we first put these <unk> into the <unk> , they looked at this , looking at those <unk> .
It 's a strange thing to do .
But very quickly , the monkeys realized that they could use these <unk> to the laboratory .
And you can see that one of the monkeys is doing this .
A <unk> B is a little bit curious , because she never saw these things .
And the map is the experimental community , and it 's very quick to realize that , obviously , humans want to think about it .
She went to <unk> , and she got some food .
It 's not just the number of monkeys in the laboratory .
And here 's a little video , and we 'll see what happened .
This is <unk> . She 's going to change food , and she 's happy , she 'll get the food .
This is <unk> , the monkeys of monkeys , which is a big .
And he was equally concerned about the beginning of food .
So the monkeys for the women is right .
As a little bit of training , they would be very good for them .
We 're just making them choices .
The question is : What does it have to do with human currencies ?
<unk> is that , or we just use a few quirky modes of psychology , <unk> monkeys to do something , which is really smart .
So we thought , if this is their currency , it 's also like what we do with it , and what kind of natural reactions do they do ?
And as you can imagine , when they start doing it , they started doing smart things that they did .
They will start to notice how much price they 're going to get to buy , and remember that these monkeys are <unk> .
Can you look at the monkeys ?
So our monkeys grew up .
This is how it works : we let the monkeys live in a similar <unk> cage .
And when they 're acting , we 're going to move them into a transparent oven - to - market account .
One of the interesting markets in the market -- a lot of fun , because when a monkey came into this market , people would give them a <unk> <unk> , and one of those people they could do with the <unk> and the photos , two different kinds of <unk> -- and they were able to buy a different thing from them .
These are the two students in my lab .
They 're wearing different <unk> .
In a period of time , <unk> will do exactly the same thing , so that the monkeys can realize who the prices are , who are reliable , and so on .
And you can see that these two <unk> have a little yellow plate .
The monkeys can be able to buy stuff in a <unk> .
There 's a lot of money to do that , but sometimes a little bit of <unk> can buy something much more <unk> .
Let me show you the story of the monkeys cycle .
This is from a monkey standpoint , so it 's lower .
She 's <unk> .
She 's got a little cry for the market .
And then the market opened , she had two options : buy a kiss or two <unk> .
And you can see that <unk> is a great market economist , she sells more <unk> .
She 's able to talk to our financial school .
It 's not just <unk> , most of the monkeys will sell a lot of <unk> .
Most of the monkeys will be <unk> for good food .
Start with monkeys , and we found that monkeys will focus on this .
They will care about the real value of monkeys .
And the most amazing thing is , when we start working with economists , use the <unk> of the monkeys , the data in the world is <unk> , whether it 's in a campaign research , and they 're using their way to the market .
And so in the study of <unk> , you ca n't tell you that the data is still a monkey .
We 've managed to have a little bit of a monkeys , at least monkeys and monkeys that we 're going to do about the finance of finance .
The other problem is : Could monkeys not give us this system ?
We also observed some of the phenomena .
First , in the monkeys , we do n't find any evidence of any kind of evidence that people behave like human beings .
And the monkeys came to the market , and it would come back all the way back to the <unk> .
We also found that another thing , very <unk> , is <unk> - <unk> behavior .
The monkeys <unk> any opportunity to celebrate <unk> , steal the mate , stole us . These are all we do n't think we 're going to tell you about the monkeys , but we also see that .
It looks bad .
Are we able to see the monkeys that these monkeys are so silly ?
There 's a way to start with monkeys , and then let 's get this market , but it 's going to work for a few years .
We have a little bit of <unk> , so let 's try and experiment .
And we 're like , " Well , that 's a lot of the problems that are going to be a little bit of a problem , which is a lot of economic problems , or some economic experiments .
I want to understand how human beings are wrong , the direct way to do it , so I 'll give you a little experiment .
If you think about it , I 'm going to give you a <unk> per gallon , 10 dollars per million dollars .
Put it in your mailbox , spend a little bit of time thinking about what you 're doing .
This is your money , you can buy anything .
Get them out , and how do you do it ?
That 's good ? But give you another opportunity , you take a number of dollars .
One of the first options : adventure is taking a bunch of times , I 've eaten monkeys to decide that it 's a choice .
If you 're a positive , you can get a thousand dollars .
If it 's left , you ca n't get rid of it .
There 's a chance to get a lot more .
Another safe choice : let 's take a bunch of precise <unk> .
But it 's only 500 dollars .
You can put that money in a <unk> or a second .
Are you your intuition ?
Most people choose not to risk choices .
And those who would say , I 'm sure to take 15 dollars , why do you go to risk ?
It seems a good choice , I 'm going to do this .
That 's what you might think .
These are risk - <unk> , who 's the problem ?
The problem is that the risk of risk - <unk> is to think about another kind of problem .
Now , I 'm going to give you two dollars , 20 million dollars per pound .
You just want to get the object that you 're going to get .
Think about it in <unk> .
Now , the moment for choice , but this is a bad day .
Because you 're going to decide " <unk> " way to lose money .
The first option is a risk of risky loss -- it 's like losing coins , if you 're serious , you lose a trillion dollars .
If you look at the opposite , you do n't have to kill , 2,000 dollars per pound , or if you 're a little bit of a car , it means that you have the glasses , and it 's a five - hundred million dollars .
I saw a lot of people laughing .
So this problem is that you have the same <unk> answer , and when these choices are activated , people do n't choose for safety .
<unk> choose risk .
And then there are two types of <unk> , which is really unsatisfactory .
That 's 50 percent of the opportunity to get 100 or 2,000 dollars , or 100 percent .
And that 's what people are interested in when the risk of chronic risk comes from the beginning .
How do you do this ?
Well , this answer comes from two <unk> .
One is that we do n't have enough time to refine it .
You should be looking for the time to think about it , a choice is to take 1,000 or 2,000 , one is <unk> .
Instead , if you have the choice , it 's easier to explain .
<unk> change : " Get more or less . "
That 's good , it 's just a little bit more <unk> , and it will affect what we 're looking for .
It would enable a second two and a half -- it 's called " <unk> <unk> . "
That means we 're going to be very hated .
We do n't want to lose any money .
That means that we 're going to move into our preferences to avoid anything .
And just in the second world , people will choose risk , because nobody does n't want to take any zero .
This is also a little bit of a risk of risk -- when we go into the <unk> model , we 're going to become more risky , that 's the most <unk> part .
That 's why the negative action is <unk> .
And the reason why <unk> investors would die in the <unk> of <unk> , because they did it with less values .
And this is why the investment of the month is not willing to sell the house , because they do n't want the house to sell .
And what we 're interested in is the monkeys that we have .
If we 're designing the same problem in the monkeys market , whether do they draw that behavior ?
So we made the monkeys in two <unk> , and one of the things that was safe to do is that he would always take the same <unk> ; the other one is a risk of risks , and he 's got half of the time .
We have <unk> options -- as first as the first project -- so the monkeys had the opportunity to get more and more , or they would think they 'd get a little more <unk> .
This is the picture of the experiment .
We 'll give you two to the new ones .
The rest of the left is beginning to start with a <unk> leopard , and it looks fair .
But this two - year - old monkey had some license .
The security on the left is safe motivation .
<unk> , he would have a little <unk> for the monkeys .
These are the ones on the right hand .
Sometimes the monkeys had no license , so he would n't take any leopard .
But sometimes monkeys can get two <unk> <unk> .
A great award , so the monkeys can take three <unk> <unk> .
This is exactly exactly the same content for you .
So , the monkeys is the trade - to - exercise ratio , which is that the people who are driving the same thing every time , or they 're going to take the risk of risks , and even if you get rid of the risks of risk , there 's no license .
Human beings prefer security .
And the result is that no one has the same side of safety .
In animation and <unk> , in the same way , monkeys and humans have <unk> behavior .
And you might think that maybe the monkeys does n't like harm .
So let 's look at the behavior of the monkeys .
So we did the second <unk> experiment .
Now , the monkeys will be facing this two <unk> , and they 're not going to give a monkeys ; they 'll take a number of people who expect the <unk> .
So they did a lot of <unk> .
At first , the three <unk> <unk> : This is the monkeys that I see .
But they found that these two guys would give up less than a few weeks ago .
And on the left , he 's supplying <unk> .
Every time he 's going to have a little pair of monkeys , it 's just giving them two <unk> .
This is a risky <unk> on the right .
Sometimes one does n't get less , beautiful monkeys , but sometimes he 's going to take a little more , just to give a pair of monkeys .
How do you decide what ?
And then they can do the trade - to - fight ratio , every time to get rid of the <unk> <unk> leopard <unk> , or a risk of risky trade or three <unk> .
And the most surprising thing is , when the monkeys is faced with this choice , they draw the same behavior .
At the beginning of the experiment , monkeys became chronic .
And this is really incredible , because the monkeys is using smaller values , and there 's a very different behavior in the face of loss and face .
So what do we learn for us ?
We 're going to make <unk> . First of all we give the monkeys a <unk> , and then we 're teaching them some simple dynamics .
They 're going to do something very clever about human beings , like <unk> , for example .
They also also have the same behavior for human behavior .
They 're not going to make <unk> , they 're killing us .
And the first conclusion that I want to show you today is that if you just heard about it , I 'm going to go home and find a leopard when my chief <unk> .
This guy is more than 12 percent of the time . But you do n't do that , because these monkeys are <unk> to your house .
It 's a little bit <unk> . Thank you .
Please ask the monkeys to invest in the <unk> .
And of course , you do n't think that people are not good at investing .
That 's the answer to the question that you 've seen before .
And we 're trying to understand the wrong ones .
<unk> some hope , as some kind of <unk> us , or <unk> our financial process to make ourselves better .
But we 've already learned that these two seals are already affecting us .
In fact , these are the ones that affect us , because they 're older at the age of the old age .
And you may , maybe you 're not just talking about the people on the right .
Maybe it 's going to be a <unk> from the Bible .
If we believe that these are the results of the monkeys , it shows us that we 're ignorant about this stupid <unk> , early million years ago .
And this is a <unk> effect that has been affecting us very long .
How much do we know about this ?
One of the facts we learned is that we 're hard to change it .
Think about one of the first things that we first learned about eating <unk> , <unk> food , as <unk> <unk> .
You do n't think you 're going to do it .
And you do n't have to say , " I 'm not going to tell you , I ca n't wait .
But people are there with people .
We 're going to think of ourselves as good .
So I think that people have different cognitive decisions in the jungle .
You 're going to look a little bit like a <unk> straight down and look down , or look at your toes , and you 're not looking at the truth , because we 're born that way .
And this psychology is going to make a difference that investors do n't make bad decisions , so that it 's hard to avoid it .
It 's all bad news , which is that good news ?
I have some good news to tell you .
And I think the good news is that , as I start today , humans are n't just smart ; we 're smarter than the other animals in Africa .
We 're really good at trying to overcome the weight of our aging -- like I 'm here .
I do n't need to raise my hand on the wing .
I 'm going to show you the <unk> .
No need to depend on my eyes .
We have a lot of examples that we 're doing with technology or other ways that our biology is , and let 's think about it as simple .
But we have to understand where our limits are .
And this is the hardest place .
It 's like <unk> said , " People are only the only species to do it . "
The irony is that we have to know where human limits are , to overcome them .
And I hope you can recognize where your limits are , and it 's not glamorous , to understand it , jumping it and explore the tools of human forces .
I want to be able to make a human potential , but it 's probably the only species that we 're thinking about .
Thank you .
<unk>
There are only 10 percent of the plastic garbage who are killed by the metal , but there 's still about 90 percent reduction in plastic -- why plastic has a lot of <unk> and <unk> problems , and the <unk> of this waste , <unk> <unk> , can make a economic supply and a very powerful efficient energy factory that can get rid of it .
business , global issues , green , military , technology
<unk>
<unk> : We can recycle plastic .
I am trash - <unk> .
And you might find that this is really interesting because I hated garbage .
I hope that you can change a lot of things in the next 10 minutes .
I want to start with the beginning .
Think about you as a child .
How do you look at things around you ?
Maybe it 's like these kids : I first found it .
If I do something , it 's all I 'm doing .
Nothing else happened .
Well , of course , if you 're bad .
After 20 years of work , I do n't know a little bit about it , and that 's when we 're adults , not to abandon the law .
Let me explain why .
Because every day , the junk in the world is spreading through the <unk> of <unk> , about a million pounds of stuff .
A million pounds of <unk> sounds like a lot of stuff , but it 's just a hundred percent of the entire year -- less than half a year .
In fact , the United Nations estimated that about 50 percent of the total - <unk> antidepressants happened in the world , and this is one of its leading damage to the world 's fastest species .
And if you have other sorts of other things , like car - sharing , there will be more .
The more of the country , of course , is more than that .
Now , when you see these mountains , most people think it 's garbage .
And we saw a swimming boat .
And what we 're seeing here is that there 's a lot of values that are capable of <unk> these things .
And this translates into a lot of important importance , and I 'm going to ask you about how to <unk> this completely <unk> .
And as we heard about the population of the <unk> , the growth of human populations are becoming smaller .
And of course , there 's a lot of people who want to have a toy and tool .
What do we do with the tools that we 're using every day ?
And the main thing is , it 's all kinds of plastic and metal .
And the blood vessel , the <unk> of the world , are the ones that are <unk> from the outside world or in the area of <unk> and <unk> .
We get rid of the oil , we 've got a lot of <unk> , and we 're trying to get rid of the past .
These are jobs that are important for the economy and the environment that we 've now begun to see now .
But the good news is that we 're starting to regain the substance of these things that are ongoing , and are beginning to kill them , especially in Europe , where we 've been able to recycle these sorts of things , which are driven by the purpose of <unk> .
Most of the material that we 're going to extract from the resources , if it 's stuck , is the metal .
In order to understand -- I 'm here , because it 's the most glamorous metals -- if you can get killed over 90 percent of the metal , it will be used by more than 90 to the other .
<unk> is completely different than 10 percent .
In fact , only about five percent .
Most of them are infected or hidden .
Now most people think that plastic is <unk> material .
But in fact , the plastic values are much more valuable .
At the same time , the <unk> of the world is much more powerful than the amount of force in the world .
So why so much of a big and valuable quality of resources are not recycled , but it 's not worth <unk> .
One of the reasons is that because the metal is very glamorous from other elements , or metals in other sources .
They 're equally dense .
There 's different electrons and <unk> .
Even color is different .
So for the people and the machine , it 's very easy to leave them from the metal or the other substances .
The plastic is extremely dense in a very small fashion .
They have the same , very similar electronic traits and the structures .
Any plastic can be any color , as you know .
So the way that traditional material <unk> is <unk> in <unk> .
The other reason that the metal can be <unk> is that many of the ingredients are from the developed world -- unfortunately , that most of us have n't seen anything like Europe , the United States , we do n't have the same amount of resistance .
One day , it 's only a dollar - dollar increase .
And they pick them up to the <unk> , all of the metal -- the circuit , the steering cord , and then left most of them , they ca n't get rid of it .
And they drop off the plastic , and they get the metal , like this .
They got off the metal .
Perhaps this is a low - cost solution , but it 's certainly a solution to health or human health .
I call that the environment .
This is non - fairness , no safety development .
Because it 's a lot of plastic , but the other way that they 're not able to recycle plastic -- but humans are trying to kill plastic .
Here 's an example .
This photo is one of the largest <unk> that I 've ever taken on the roof , in Mumbai .
They store plastic in the roof .
Down underneath the roof , like this <unk> , and people are very keen on color , which is the shape of color and shape , etc .
Sometimes they 're going to figure out " <unk> and <unk> " is that they <unk> plastic and reject the type of plastic .
These techniques have been a significant achievement to do anything about seasons .
I do n't want to do this in the way .
So how do we do that , at least we call these <unk> ?
And I believe that they 're very , very big , so that you ca n't get them out of it , or they 're going to burn it .
So about 20 years ago , I started trying to try and try to figure out how to make these very similar materials to each other , and then I had a lot of friends in my friends , the friends of the world .
Because the bottom line is , we 're doing the boat .
We eventually <unk> the challenge .
This is the final shot of <unk> .
This is the fact that the number of important ingredients on Earth are managed by recycled .
And finally , we found the method of <unk> .
In this process , we started <unk> the process of creating plastic industries .
The conventional approach is to use oil or <unk> .
<unk> the molecule , and then using a special way to replicate it , it creates a fabulous amount of <unk> every day .
We think there are more dynamic ways to create <unk> .
This dynamic is not just standing in the realm of the ecology , but from the economic point .
<unk> is a very good experiment .
The cost is not much cheaper than oil , and a lot of it is , as I hope , you can see from the photo .
Because because we do n't make plastic into molecules , then we <unk> the way that we use it .
It 's smaller than ours .
It 's very energy .
I do n't know how many of the projects in the world are saving 80 to 90 percent of our energy use .
So what we do is that millions of people are building a type of <unk> , and our factories are able to create a certain type of <unk> .
We found that the plastic for those ingredients for <unk> products .
Our clients love a lot of CO2 pollution .
They 're them .
They can produce more sustainable products .
It 's very limited to just share with you a little bit about what we 're doing .
It 's starting to spread into the metal , and it 's allowing the metal to the metal .
And then they <unk> the metal , and they put it into something called recycled <unk> -- the processes that vary -- it 's very complex , but the major is plastic .
We take a bunch of plastic stuff , and they miss the metal , the pendulum , <unk> , rubber bars , glue , you 'll list the list .
It 's even animal animals .
This is the first part of the process that we do , and it looks like traditional flooding .
We used to paste on the metal , and we use air conditioning .
It looks like a <unk> factory .
In the end , we have to create plastic with plastic plastic and lots of levels of plastic .
This is the beginning of the process of all the processes and the most difficult work that we 've ever done .
We packaged plastic up to the size of the <unk> .
We <unk> the <unk> process , and we <unk> it , not just the pattern , but it 's <unk> .
And then finally , there 's a little bit of plastic in the last process : a pattern , a pattern .
And then we <unk> color with color .
We put five million volumes of <unk> .
And then you put these ingredients into the <unk> , and it 's going to dissolve it into a little bit of glass .
And then you turn it into the <unk> of <unk> .
This is the currency of the plastic industry .
This is exactly exactly the same thing as oil production .
And now we 're going to do something like a bladder - time , and then you can do it again .
So today , instead of trying to be part of a developing world , or you get rid of the mountain , and you can find your old things , then you 're going to get out of your house for new , <unk> your <unk> offices or your cousin .
These are just part of the kind of company that we use to use plastic for plastic to make new products .
So I hope I 've changed the way you think about things , at least .
We 've got a hint from nature .
Nature is almost entirely <unk> , almost anything .
I hope you do n't think of myself as a consumer -- that 's my entire love of my life -- to try to be a form of resources , knowing that they can become an alternative form after other forms .
And finally , hope you allow me to change a little bit about the last child , " If anything bad . "
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> on his engineered landscape
And this four months I 've been playing with three wishes all over the place , and all of the ideas are <unk> around .
I think everybody can do it .
If you give you three wishes , what do you want to do ?
Think about a problem , except for a while , you can do something about it , and maybe we can make a difference .
<unk> Nature is the theme of this .
And that 's also what I did .
And I was obsessed with Canada .
<unk> <unk> : My dad is very interested in <unk> .
So I had a lot of opportunities to experience and experience it with him .
I might never say anything about it since that .
But I think at least I 've learned a little bit about it between this leopard , and we 're just looking at the nature of nature , looking for the <unk> of the coast of <unk> and forests , to read the way that everybody 's going to feel different .
All right now , everything I do is come from the feeling , and I feel like I should do it .
So , in a Tuesday morning , I came up with my own <unk> , and I shot it on the road .
And these <unk> images are made up of me for a few years .
But as a player artist , I 've always felt this kind of work that I have to say , and it 's also the same work as an artist 's career .
I 've never been able to think of people as <unk> , or something like that , or whatever .
So I started thinking about it , and I 'm going to think about it .
I decided to <unk> myself to focus on the landscapes of the human force .
When I was lost , I found a little bit about inspired .
And I was on a road left , and I thought it could go back to the corner .
And it turned out to be a town called " <unk> <unk> , " which happened to me when I came up and saw a sinister face .
Completely <unk> of human forces .
In this painting , I began to start looking at the landscapes of the landscape , looking for other kinds of <unk> or large industries , or <unk> .
And this became the design of my work .
And it 's become the work that I kept stuck with , and this is not a big theme of what I 'm going to do with the large industrial sector , which is enough for me to do a lot of life .
And I want to borrow the opportunity for that opportunity to help my company .
And basically , every photo you see here is possible to get permission , and if not their help , if they 're not a company leader , I might never forget these paintings .
I do n't want to say anything about it .
And I 'm also a director of a company , and I can feel that they 're doing the importance of their everyday lives .
But also , I 'm also concerned about sustainability .
That 's because it 's , because I 'm going to leave them with them .
I do n't want to dwell on what they 're doing because all of it is n't sudden .
So I started thinking about it , and we had a lot of time .
Even though it 's left , it keeps saving .
But we 've never seen that .
And search for the past .
This is a very scary thing , when we go back and look at what 's going on on this land , and we suddenly think of the same thing .
And I hope that the audience is playing with my photos , and I feel that it 's not something that feels like this .
Do n't <unk> " God , what it does , " but it 's a cruel , <unk> , a glamorous beauty of beauty , which makes people happy .
To think of this as a beautiful , <unk> , I think that this is what I want to say , and I hope that people are not just familiar with these pieces , but thinking about the feeling that I 'm going to understand when I 've done this .
It 's only about the lives of <unk> , and it 's just life life .
Think about it .
When did I start with life ?
I have to admit that this is a little bit easier to make me feel like I 've made my work .
And look at this picture here , this <unk> <unk> , which is the largest piece of paper , about 30,000 million volumes old .
And here 's the <unk> in California , close to <unk> , and it 's only about two hours from my house , but four years from a fire .
And I decided to go to some kind of point of view , if the work was just focused on natural nature , and now it 's a really good journey for the junk that you see in the natural world , which is a good beginning for me .
And I think that the work of junk seals is a practice of human sustainability .
There 's only a lot of sustainability that we 're going to live in .
And of course , in this conference , I heard a lot of the uses of <unk> , <unk> and nanotechnology , wanting to protect our nature .
Despite our ideas .
But this is still .
Environment is accelerating .
And after a period of time in North America , I started <unk> the world , and what you 're seeing here is that I 've taken pictures of pictures .
These images , these images are from one of the images I heard .
And at the time of the day , the <unk> of oil spills were caused by the fact that the amount of ice that happened in the world , it had a global amount of need to fall into the world , and it was <unk> .
All of these <unk> had to be in 2004 .
And I thought , " Oh , my God , it 's too glamorous . "
A big boat is made in a little bit of <unk> , and it 's all happening in the <unk> countries .
So I would like to go to India looking at this .
But because of the local community , I was struck by India , so I 'm going to go through the destination , and this is the first time I 've ever been touched with this thing , which is really incredible for me .
In the other part of the world , it 's all over the place , and there are all sorts of people who are hungry everywhere that are poisonous conditions everywhere .
This is one of the largest slums of California , and I 've got new ideas that we live in .
So I also want to work with oil as a foundation .
This is one of the projects that I want to do in the next three years , and it might be called " oil . "
And I think what we 're seeing around us is the relationship between the oil or the <unk> , or <unk> .
Let 's take a look at some photos in China .
And I started shooting at China for four years ago , and I would say , China is sustainable , but China provides a huge amount of impact on my childhood .
I come from a state of industrial cities , and my dad is local . My dad plays it very well , so I 'm very familiar with it , but the same industry is completely different .
What you see here is the biggest <unk> of human production , which is that the size of the human manufacturing is more than doubled .
And most of the engineers in the world think it 's not going to happen , and only one , " It 's too big . "
In fact , when this project was completed for a year and a half years ago , people were actually able to <unk> the <unk> earthquake of the ice .
And the entire <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is also one of the largest <unk> of human history in <unk> .
And this polar bear also brings into all the <unk> of the city , and the number of people in the Arctic are going to move into the cities and they 're going to <unk> the city .
This is one of the city moves over and over again .
This is about <unk> , basically , based on artificial <unk> .
And I think there are three billion of the buildings that have been used in the process of <unk> , which are completely autonomous , and it 's just only limited to time .
You can imagine .
It 's the <unk> of the people who live in the city of life , and every single <unk> is <unk> a rock , they get a lot of money .
Here 's some other slides .
And I 'm going to show you three of these three - quarters of the world that 's going to vary .
This looks like a butterfly bombing .
This is an area that 's completely dependent on the land of the world .
It 's a powerful force , to make sure that they 're happy to be happy .
But this may be a good thing to know that China is now thinking about <unk> shrimp now .
There 's been no one in four years without building a vegetable vegetable because nobody wants to put a fire on their yard .
But China can say , " No , we need to build <unk> in 10 years .
And it was still <unk> in one year .
So the resources itself also are a major problem .
Another problem that <unk> <unk> is a lot of land , and you can see that you 're going to see it on top of the left , but it 's never going to get a lot of work on underwater , so it 's a rock .
It 's about two million people who are just providing the data for the military .
That 's waiting for them waiting .
This is <unk> new , major <unk> .
This is the city of cities , and it 's also <unk> areas .
And in the midst of the city , I 'm very upset about what I think is that they are completely <unk> of what we call cities .
There 's no park here , no <unk> .
It 's only about <unk> <unk> .
They 've never seen the opportunity to build a beautiful city , but they do n't think they 're going to do that .
Here 's a piece of paper , and it says " <unk> population and <unk> . "
<unk> science , civilization , progress .
It 's a sin of <unk> , and you 'll notice that it 's all about Western cultures .
<unk> , <unk> .
But what I 'm afraid is that the culture of <unk> is hidden behind the <unk> .
They do n't look at our way of life at a moment .
And when you look back at how they divide their older older <unk> , the <unk> of the city , you would have a <unk> understanding of this <unk> .
This photo took one of the largest shops in the city , and there was a rural village in town .
And now , in China , there are all sorts of people who are living in <unk> seals , and in the future of 15 years , it 's going to be about five billion people around the world , where it will be the equivalent of five million people -- and they 're making the center of the Shanghai ice or the manufacturing center .
These are producing companies that come from local firms , or most of them are in China , and they 're used to use the same color .
And this factory is used by <unk> , which is a <unk> .
They provide their staff .
<unk> from the countries around the country to come up here .
This is one of the largest slums of <unk> around the polar bear , and it 's about about 150 production employees .
And what this photo took was to look at the scene , and this day comes into <unk> .
There are two <unk> , two in the same region .
There are about 30,000 employees here , so it 's about 20 percent of the people in the <unk> .
They have only <unk> <unk> .
And then <unk> <unk> , the <unk> workers , this is a huge amount of labor , which is the Shanghai city , a <unk> city that will be <unk> for five years , and the new building will come from here .
This is the same thing that 's shown in Shanghai , or China , and if you 're in five years , people are not going to appear .
They 're very aggressive .
They 're not going to move , and they stop .
There are no good benefits , they 're never going to give their house .
Only when their aspiration is , they 're going to compromise it .
And it took a lot of money to get out of the car , and they got a little bit more <unk> .
And then these buildings are going to have the same story with the rest of the neighborhood , and even a couple of hours of <unk> , in the next two hours in Shanghai , on the spinal cord .
And I think that 's probably one of the biggest culprits on this planet .
But they do n't find a bad path , which is my wish , and I 'm going to tell you about the way that the house can build better .
This kind of <unk> logic is very , very important , and they 're called <unk> .
This <unk> is just going to move .
<unk> do n't have a <unk> , and if it 's a big picture , you can see the electron junk that you 're going to tell you about their career .
And as <unk> moves , it 's also in <unk> .
This is a <unk> trip in Shanghai .
There 's a very high city , and it 's also a high - speed city that 's rapidly developed faster , so I do n't have any cities with it .
Even the <unk> of a 15 million people had a population of 100,000 people who grew up in the first half of the year , and the population was growing over the first time .
There 's a huge amount of impact on migration , which is very fast from this picture , and it 's only about nine stars in this picture .
The <unk> of the <unk> produces these cars will be sent to the city , Shanghai , <unk> and <unk> , and it 's just a hint of Chinese markets .
Just just <unk> cars .
This is the city of a high - speed <unk> area , and this is where building buildings are evolving .
The <unk> buildings are still waiting for waiting to go back into the <unk> .
And you can see the full density of the <unk> here .
But I did n't think that in the photo was n't that when I saw these buildings , I was first thinking about the fact that they had no glasses , every single sheet of windows had covered in a air air .
And I think there are some of the things that are more powerful than me , and I do n't think that the <unk> is going to be more effective and more effective .
When we 're going to zoom in in the size of the Shanghai city , you 'll find that <unk> <unk> is just a <unk> of a forest that looks like a forest .
So the speed of a high - speed city has only been written by the <unk> of <unk> .
In this picture , there 's a little bit of <unk> <unk> in this photo .
About eight months ago , there was a new set of exploration emerged from <unk> <unk> .
It 's based on the building of the Shanghai garage building .
I started painting some of the large industrial sites in China .
This is a picture of the <unk> , for example , in the <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> supply supply plate , <unk> <unk> , 18 <unk> .
There 's a lot of employees here , I think , at least 75 people have <unk> , and here 's <unk> <unk> .
They 're building new kinds of big <unk> , trying to move into the Chinese demand .
You can see it in the photo .
You notice , every photo does n't look at dust .
So what you 're seeing here is a video of <unk> .
The motivation here is to work for a thousand hours every day .
I think there 's a question that we 're talking about when we talk about China , but it 's always the most advanced technology they 've ever had .
This place , in my shot , has <unk> workers .
I asked them to look at their <unk> , and I 'm going to show you the most <unk> staff of the <unk> that I 've stood on every person in the last person .
She was a very <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the real truth of China is that it 's not just the basis of the rise of East Europe , that they have the simple and devices that are n't just like these devices , but this country is not working , and they 're willing to work work , they want work .
And there 's also a huge <unk> of surgery waiting at every <unk> .
And if everybody does n't change their ideas , then it 's going to continue to be about 15 times the end of the year , and there 's a billion people in the city .
So let 's go back to this photo , and here 's the picture you see here .
I had to do that in front of the <unk> of the photo .
So I have to make sure that they 're going to be at two seconds .
I photographed my work in their work , but they 're hard at work .
Because they 're used to work in a daily mood , so I 'm going to get a license , and he 's big .
This is a picture that looks good for me .
This is a picture of a <unk> <unk> photo , which is a <unk> remix .
And what you saw here is the highest amount of <unk> in the picture .
This is <unk> <unk> , 20 million dollars per year .
It takes about 12 people to manage them , and they need to go back into the line .
<unk> is that industrial scene is very powerful .
So I did n't have a company .
And so I 've done that in two slides , and I do a lot of things that go into the scale of something larger .
This is the <unk> factory , and here 's the <unk> <unk> , and it 's going to be sent to the <unk> stores .
This is a <unk> factory , a lot of density .
There are about 30,000 workers here .
The staff of the entire factory is the foundation of the country .
I think it 's very difficult to go into the International entrepreneurial community , and the company is n't very glamorous , or they 're not going to get me into a pencil .
And they do n't want me to go .
But there 's a lot more .
This kind of work is spread in China , and you can get one of the first <unk> industries of <unk> to China .
<unk> cost is a very high cost , so they 're very needed to choose a low - cost marketplace market .
This is a high - tech company , <unk> cell phones , one of the largest squatter phones in China .
And because of the <unk> of China , I think it 's going to be a new type of mobile company that might have a new cell company , a week .
This is a <unk> <unk> company , one of the largest slums of China , China .
Next photo is a <unk> .
It 's all very effective .
The people who look at me are <unk> in the <unk> for 10 minutes .
This is the biggest one I 've ever met .
The main foundation , they 're the largest <unk> makers of the world , and also the biggest <unk> producers are all over 20 years .
This is the <unk> employee , and it 's a half - year - old <unk> that they 're building in the building .
These are pictures of me recently , just back a month ago , so you 've got the first picture of these guys who saw these pictures .
And I spent about a year , and I 've got a few months of <unk> relationships .
So let 's look at the other side of China , this is a terrible state of resources .
So there 's a lot of steps that we 're shooting at in the world , and we 're going to collect it .
This is a metal layer , and this is the <unk> , the interior of the electromagnetic cord , from the generator to get rid of its toes and the metal .
These are not <unk> to California or Silicon Valley .
And that 's ultimately the end of the project .
There are about half of the computers in the world , in China .
They 're called this " <unk> junk . "
But because they 're killing the problem , these junk seals actually do a very broad amount of problems in China , and they use <unk> engines to heat off the board .
There 's a value of value to the metal .
But there 's a lot of ice that has a large amount of <unk> in the village , and the place where you 're going to be <unk> or <unk> , you can smell that <unk> odor .
This is another part of the other , and most of them are a bunch of family shops , which may not be <unk> in the house , but maybe even in a room , or even the rooms , they 're not going to get rid of this kind of stuff -- and they ca n't stop doing this .
This is a little girl , and I rarely had to feel like I could n't have my own experience , but it was n't going to happen in the way of Mao <unk> , experienced the <unk> of the Empire State War , where she sat on the underside of his family , so she 's sitting next to his home .
This path is thrown off the underside of the <unk> , and this is the largest piece of electronic junk seals transmission .
This is what I want to show you .
I want to wish my wish to my two daughters .
And in all of my thinking , they 're never going to escape me .
The bottom on the right is <unk> , on the left , on the left .
All of this , all of these things that I 've taken on , is a very important thing to do .
And all of this is happening here in this moment , and it 's going to change all the problems that I want to do .
And I think that we 're not going to change the world , and we need to keep ourselves down , changing ourselves , even in Asia , at the same time , but when I know that this is a <unk> thing , it 's also why we have to focus on their development , because that 's what the development of our development is also affecting us .
And this one is what I want to do , and also my wish to take this idea of thinking about this , " 20 years later , or 15 years after that , when they start to think about meditation , the family and the next day they 're going to have a day of what 's going on ? "
Whether I think about my work , or thinking about it , it 's all about the core opportunity of all the questions I think about .
And my first wish : change the world . I want to use my photos to learn more about sustainability .
And I think it 's not an inclusive scope of communication .
I 've been doing some research before , and I hope that my wish can be <unk> , not stopping .
Even now my wish is not yet , but I 've found a similar act of action .
<unk> is a great blog of <unk> .
It 's been close to a half a month .
And the key to this site is that their attitudes are what I love .
And they 're not going to go out of the realm of cultural movement , and I think it 's the most difficult thing to do , because they try to understand the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , not to show people the active ones in the environment , instead of trying to get people to try and change the dynamic .
And this blog is showing you a little bit about the positive effects of the world .
There 's a new idea , new energy device in new technologies , and it 's all about sustainability .
And what I could do is I can do my work on the website .
Some people have already known , and I 'm also designed to design some of the <unk> of TED , which is , of course , a lot of <unk> , not the end of what 's called the design of any kind of design that 's used in any type of media .
You can put <unk> on the site , CDs or whatever .
This is the beginning .
So what we think is that most media is , in fact , a lot of the press uses a lot of text , and it 's full of words , and it 's full of text .
In the <unk> of <unk> , it 's only about <unk> ads , which is very glamorous .
And so we designed this for a lot of images to think about it , and people think of people at the same time , thinking , " <unk> , what 's the point ? "
And they want people to bring the problem open .
Despite <unk> , it 's just a blog , but I hope it can be more developed , and I 'm not going to use it to think about it , because there 's a lot of people who have a lot of money .
I believe that it can generate their own voice , and it 's going to be in the site , in this website , from the Chinese , China , North America , across the world .
And I believe that someday we can make a big conversation about sustainability , big discussion .
If you want to be doing something , it 's <unk> .
My next wish is to think more about the next generation .
This wish is : I want to start a strategic campaign to encourage kids to increase their own thoughts .
And this idea is that in my head , I 've talked about the junk that 's in the head of an overdose , and I think it 's eight to the sixth of the friends of eight and the fifth quarter .
And all of you know about eight or seven years old , they start developing , and they started to develop social .
So what we do is we 're very important at this stage .
And I just want you all .
I do n't think we can start to get them out of the <unk> , and they know what is sustainable and nurture .
And one of the ways I think about it is to take a lot of money to get a fee - to - a - half dollar fund as a license to drive the project , in terms of motivation .
And then I ended up in my mind , and I would end up in the end .
One of the best jobs of <unk> <unk> is a good job to develop a best family , sustainable advice , a better community and a sustainable community .
And I also want to add one of the world 's art award , and this is a huge project , if we can give a group of people to work on this project or sacrifice the program to make the project a lot of schools , including all schools and all the schools that are involved in this competition .
<unk> is <unk> a real project , rather than some <unk> .
And the art can be their thought , or the processes , but everything has to be <unk> .
So what we 're actually trying to do is actually start to think about this kind of a liberal child .
Through them , I believe that their behavior can influence their parents , their families will help them participate in activities .
And the end of that will be to focus on the idea of sustainability , where you 're all going to be <unk> junk junk , and I do n't think all of you will pay attention to sustainable development and to understand how sustainable it is .
But I 'm very hopeful that everyone can understand this , and that 's exactly what I 've been trying to do .
Let 's go back to the <unk> of the world , and we 're able to collect art for the art of competition as propaganda .
I love that the theme of my world is allowing us to realize that ourselves are the <unk> of the world .
This is my world , rather than other people , but I should protect her , and I think this is a good opportunity to encourage kids to use their own imagination , to try to engage their imagination for this project , for <unk> .
I think every school should take a group of money and <unk> students to join this activity .
And that 's what we can do at the same time , " My world . "
And my third wish was to make a film film , and I said to myself , I should take a movie like this , and this is my wish .
When I first saw the film film , I found that this worked with my work , and some of the sorts of things I 'd like to do is , you know , everything is going to work as a <unk> or something like that .
If you give me a chance , I 'm going to give you the <unk> of the audience .
Well , of course , I need someone to come <unk> .
I 've just had a <unk> birthday , and I did n't have time to spend a lot of time on learning , so I need someone to help me do a quick job for me to work with me .
That 's my three wishes .
<unk>
James <unk> asks you that he 's going to go into his career family dinner , where his parents educate the meaning of compassion : to the person who really need love , to love the love of what it really needs for .
charter for compassion . chautauqua , compassion , faith , global issues , life , religion
<unk>
James <unk> on compassion
<unk> : What does it look like ?
I grew up with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in South <unk> .
If you come in , you 're going to see us in front of the night , 10 people in the evening , but not every single step . That 's good .
Because her mother had eight kids , and sometimes she said she was vicious .
But before we eat , she said , " All the kids are there ? "
If someone did n't stay , we would say , stay a plate , put him in the oven , and then we applaud .
So , when you sit down in front of the table , this is a parable of our family when anyone is elected as a lawyer , or when the dad gets a college teacher , and if you have a job in our university , we do n't have five times when we 've got five minutes for that person to wake up with the person who says , " Well , <unk> is going to take five 10 minutes to this person .
It 's a glorious person , everybody is obsessed .
And also , we have to report a lot about our families in our family , and that 's the population of the family who ca n't get the patient and the elderly .
And my mission is , at least once a week to visit <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> -- <unk> - <unk> by the road , <unk> .
Why ? Because they have to do it . So we need to look at whether they need anything .
And the mother says , " It 's a family , it 's about sharing and sharing . "
They 're also members of our family . "
Of course , there 's a reward .
They 're going to be <unk> and <unk> .
The mother says , " If they ask you how much money you get , you have to say , ' No money , if they 're fighting you 're going to give you a little bit of nature .
In fact , she did it , and if we do that , not only we 'll have the joy of <unk> members , her <unk> , who said , " God will smile , the world is full of peace , <unk> and joy . "
So , in <unk> , I learned something about compassion .
And of course , this is a family of <unk> , so we have to <unk> God .
So I 've always been thinking about <unk> , and I said , " All the kids are there ? "
And if we insist on caring and share , we believe that this world is going to do the world with peace and peace .
Now , the restaurant is n't always good .
I want to explain why we ca n't help .
That 's Christmas , one morning in our house .
On the morning , we opened our gift , and we have a special place where we 're in the age of the old pond , but we sing <unk> . That 's a very tight moment .
In fact , you can fall out of the tree , get a gift and ready to sing , and then you do n't have to be <unk> or <unk> , but the dad <unk> everything .
Because his colleague was no place in this special Christmas .
And then the dad came up with his colleagues love to celebrate families .
We think he must be crazy .
That 's our moment . This is a behavioral <unk> .
This is what we can do with ourselves , but now we have this <unk> <unk> , and we 're still wearing a restaurant and he 's wearing a pendulum and dust .
Why is the dad born ?
It 's not just Christmas , anything else .
Mom does n't hear us , " You know what the truth is , if you understand real <unk> , celebrate your love .
This is the real meaning of celebrate .
<unk> is <unk> space , and it 's sharing fun in a <unk> family . "
Okay , we 've got it .
But in <unk> , compassion is n't an <unk> to debate , and it 's a sense of how we <unk> the emotion of the effort .
Our brothers are <unk> .
It 's like a Seattle flag saying , " We 're not the <unk> of life .
We 're just hanging out there .
So no matter what we do , we 're right .
This is compassion .
So I tell you , I 'm looking at this world .
I look at the photo , and some people say , " Look , that 's compassion . "
And one of the <unk> that <unk> out in the corner is <unk> to remind me that the traditional tradition of Jews that you might actually have , but you have to do something that does n't have enough to raise all the people who do n't get out there .
Talk about a picture of compassion .
I saw a picture of my <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> , maybe you 're going to come up with other romantic religions , move around the bridge and go to <unk> .
It 's just one photo .
<unk> war .
Even without <unk> and religious relations , for a common desire to become siblings , change our senses .
Now , there 's another photo . I really like this photo .
When <unk> was Dr. King of <unk> , we had all the people in our community .
You 'll hear countries everywhere .
Bob Cooper gives a mistake from <unk> .
This is the picture . They said , " It 's going to change too much , you ca n't go . "
He said , " I must go . "
So , sitting on the truck , the community 's <unk> , and the neighborhood says , " I have a bad news to tell you .
Some people probably did n't hear when <unk> was Dr. <unk> .
I understood you 're upset , and I understand that there 's a chance to do it now , but he says , " Well , I hope you know what you are .
Because my dad was rejected .
I understand your feelings . "
And then he said , " I hope you have power to do what I do .
And I <unk> my anger , my <unk> and my sad grief , and I decided to go to a new world and we could get together . "
This is a picture . Is it compassion ? I think I saw it .
I saw it as when I was in the Church of England , and he brought democracy from the <unk> of England .
And he asked them to send a message , and every one of them uses their language to understand it , which is another version of the other version , " How do you respond to other people to others . "
12 people in <unk> , or <unk> .
We 're connected to this kind of thing , and we have to do it like all sorts of behavior .
And there 's another photo that I think about the church , nine - year - old <unk> , a <unk> <unk> and a television account , when a TV is a journalist , and when the public service in the city , we continue on our cities .
" That 's " he said , " Life is one of the <unk> moments in history . "
We 're all in <unk> .
But you 're inviting all of traditional traditions to join them .
And to find that , what you 're going to do is tell us what we 're being <unk> when we 've been dumped , when you get <unk> and reject what they 're doing , and then they will use their traditional tradition .
Okay , now I found compassion a day , but I became a storyteller .
Now , as a cartoonist , my job is <unk> and <unk> , but I should do this .
Or , like <unk> <unk> told people , " Some people <unk> .
I have to say , " <unk> <unk> . "
So the real question is : How do you say to compassion ?
How do you make it real ?
My <unk> <unk> become ideal , and once I kept challenges .
In my traditional tradition , we 're going to give a gift to the other traditions of the world .
Many people think that the first one is charity , random <unk> .
But for those who really studied , you 'll find a problem slowly slowly , and causing this <unk> .
And the question is , " What is the greatest <unk> ? "
And by the way , it came out , " You must love love yourself , you have to love your <unk> love , your God , and your neighbor . "
And then people say , " Well , what you mean , neighbors ? " And he talked about a man 's story to answer the question , and the <unk> of religion is how to get to the other side of the way , but how they 're connected to other people , they 've got to go to a path and tell him that it 's going to help his own , <unk> and <unk> , to <unk> him .
And then she said , " That 's just the beginning , if he 's going to help , you have to help it .
Whatever he needs to be , I 'll come back to you . "
And this is true for me to be an <unk> aware of what 's going on .
A big <unk> is n't just easy to survive , only one directly cares about and philanthropy , but a whole range of ways that I 'm talking about a kind of sustainable care and care .
I think maybe there 's one of the things that when the Bible talks about health and commitment to the market , all the God 's kids need to be taken care , so when <unk> asks , " What is the kids ? "
A happy person to prove compassion is so happy .
I think I 'm going to depend on how to focus on their souls , looking at their house , pay attention to their houses , health , their dad , the <unk> of the children , <unk> , and even the kids who are not born and care of children .
As a <unk> is to care about these people .
But now , as a big <unk> , I always say , well , it 's not easy to do for a nice American , not simply for me .
Compassion is a dynamic .
I 'm sure that we 're doing everything in the <unk> Street on the streets of <unk> , and it 's going to be done in his house and the author , until we become a family , trying to understand the natural nature of the world , understanding nature nature .
We become a man .
So let me explain that I 'm going to tell you about compassion and why I think that compassion is vital .
We decided to create compassion .
It 's so important that it 's a very special moment of history .
This moment is the <unk> of the Bible , and it 's a day of God , or that year .
This is an <unk> season .
<unk> things are happening .
Please let me ask you , as a black eclipse , to celebrate Obama 's election , it 's a very unusual portrait of God .
And so there 's so many things to be done .
We need to have health , food and education , all of our children , remember the <unk> of God .
Now , let me tell you a little bit about what I 'm going to say when I continue , it 's usually the form of poetry .
So I 'd like to end with a song .
And to finish this <unk> , we 're all kids in <unk> .
If the <unk> of the Mother taught us right , we have a sense of meaning , not only part of our party , but the whole <unk> signs .
That 's why we do it .
<unk> is : I 'm going to make heaven so happy ♫ ♫ I 've got God love and <unk> , ♫ when I take a look at it , I do n't see , you ca n't do it right now , and you can not see it . ♫ And I 'd like to say , " Well , let 's do that , so I 'll see that I have a happy smile for you , which is compassion .

Yves <unk> : A passionate dance for kids
My name is <unk> <unk> .
I come from very far .
I had a very upset story for people who were <unk> for me .
That 's a tough way of writing , and I 'm going to tell you a story about it .
And that 's what you 're telling you .
But for me , the easiest way to use music is to express the physical .
I call myself a <unk> child .
And I was doing this because of the women in my village in the village .
Without newspapers , she does n't care about what she thinks about social .
And there 's a young man who wants to make change , but nobody has to hear his voice , because he does n't write it .
Or , he ca n't touch the Internet , not Facebook , Facebook or YouTube , or Facebook .
And the other thing is that my dream is to make sure that it 's necessary to say that this story is necessary , and the story includes my dreams , but even in my <unk> , I can listen to some of the sounds that I 've ever seen before , " Do n't get it . "
Sometimes I think about it , not going to work , because I do n't know what to do .
When I was born in the ' 80s , my country was happening in a war .
And I looked at our village in the <unk> .
It 's a important thing for me to do with me .
And when I was five years old , I saw me being raped .
My mother died in war .
My brothers are divided together .
And so I went to my dad , and I stayed in tears .
And so I was looking at it every day , and my mother was crying in a violent way .
So I 'm called myself .
And not only that , eight year year I became a <unk> .
I do n't know what war is .
But the experience of the past is deep in my face .
When I went to <unk> , I said , " I 'm going to kill as many Muslims as much as possible . "
He trained , but it 's a motivation , because I hope for family .
I wish for the people in the village .
<unk> is , now , it 's going to come up because I understand <unk> .
It 's not just the Middle East , not the Muslims .
It 's sitting in front of the entire system , and they 're going to do it by religion , but they want to get oil , <unk> and land .
So , understand what the truth is , what would it be to keep <unk> ?
I picked up my <unk> , and now I 've played music with Muslims .
I made a documentary called " <unk> Kids . "
So she said , " That 's okay . "
But my story is <unk> .
And then I 'm going to get into another dimension , which I can do .
I 'm going to give you a poem that 's called " <unk> <unk> " from my <unk> children .
I 'll tell my story .
That 's a <unk> , and we do n't have any food that we have , we 're going to start with our friends .
It was just the last 16 people .
I hope you can hear my <unk> .
My dreams are full of <unk> .
She was every day .
I looked at the sounds of friends who were murdered .
They 're all dead in my friends , because hunger is dead .
And in the absence of the <unk> forest , in the <unk> Desert .
And they died , and I went around and God listened to me .
When I was really overwhelmed , I had the meat that I would eat when I could n't eat .
We 've <unk> our entire village in the past , looking at anything that can be <unk> .
I know what it is , but I need food .
So I was forced to die of crime , but it was only for the <unk> for <unk> .
Sometimes you have to lose them .
Do n't give me , do n't stop .
<unk> is seven years old .
And after a year , I 've spent a hundred years of life on life .
She 's going to sleep every day , and it 's just a <unk> .
I need to flee , break , <unk> , calm or <unk> .
I saw my people died in war .
But <unk> saw the enemy of dead , at least not seen the body of the people who killed me .
In <unk> , I 'm not going to deny you .
<unk> are like lightning .
And I was very young at the time , and I had a little bit of that , and I was quite sure that I was struggling .
And I saw my hand in <unk> , and I 'm going to show you , no , no , no .
I live in terms of <unk> .
I 'm a kid who did n't have a mother , and I am still new .
But in this new <unk> , I stopped alone .
It does n't wait for us to wait .
I ca n't wait for me .
Sometimes , in doing something right , I have to go to crime .
It seems to be alive .
I feel like the feelings of people feel .
<unk> : Children from Darfur !
On the TV , we see that you 're fighting to fight .
And I went .
It does n't help .
My country was swallowed by war .
And the music that I heard was <unk> and <unk> .
You see people die , and I do n't even have two balls for them .
And I asked the question , what do I do ?
Why do n't my people get upset ?
Why when other kids were in school , I was learning how to cook .
I 've eaten the snail , and I have <unk> , <unk> snakes and so on .
I had all the stuff .
I know that this is <unk> , but who is going to blame ?
This is my story , my life .
Thank you .
I 've been working on my head , which is my creation .
I never expect to be familiar with my story , and I 'm never going to tell you about it .
The music is my license .
By music , I actually saw heaven , and I was happy to become a kid , with music dancing .
And I know that music is only the only way to go directly into the organ , the heart of the patient , and it 's going to affect your heart , even if you do n't know what your minds are .
It 's only a music that allows you to get out of your bed and get a lot of natural attention .
I 've often <unk> the power of music to love because of love .
And if you love a frog , you 're born with a frog .
And here 's a story of the story , which is the <unk> of my music , and I was a child 's military .
I 'm <unk> people in the north .
But somehow I do n't hate them .
We 're around the music .
So what I 'm surprised to do is , there 's one day a little bit of a Arab music meeting to us and sing for us .
I dance with music as well as my music dance .
But I have a problem .
Now , I 'm a music person , and I know the power of music .
So what happened ?
I 've got a very upset journey .
This is the winner of the <unk> , and I just left 65 .
Have n't breakfast and lunch .
I started a movement called " <unk> . "
I was losing it , and I could n't believe it .
And I had this project with lunch and lunch , and we wanted to build a school in <unk> .
And the reason I do that is because in my house , it 's normal .
Now I went to the West , and I 'm just going to just eat my <unk> .
The kids in my village tend to get the reports of the BBC or other monkeys , and they wait to wait for a day and say , " <unk> breakfast for breakfast , because it means we raise enough money to build schools .
And I made this promise , and I said , " To this project , I decided to go home . "
And I think it 's enough to be known for a month to raise money , but I do n't find it .
It 's all over here .
I said , " No , no . "
And I saw people in Facebook , and the P supported my actions .
Some people gave three dollars .
The lowest license is for 20 cents .
Some people give us 20 cents .
And I did n't know how they did it .
But they moved older .
And I 'm going to give you all of my life .
I 'm even going to do that because I understand that this is really important for anyone who 's in my village .
<unk> can lead the brain for a lot of opportunities to make a difference .
Because it 's a long long term of <unk> .
My country became very <unk> .
In the refugee camp , you can see that 20 or 30 people live for their families .
They only understood from the U.N.
But you know , if you give license handouts , you 're going to have a whole generation .
If you want to help Africa , let 's talk about what we need to do .
Show us our tools .
Africa has rain ; they have <unk> . People can plant crops .
Please invest in education .
To invest in education , it 's a powerful institution to create a revolution .
They 're going to die they 're going to die immediately .
If you invest in Africa , we can change Africa .
This is what I call it .
In order to get this goal , I developed the <unk> African , and through this institution , we went back to school .
And now we have <unk> university .
There are 40 kids who are <unk> kids , and we think we need to support kids .
And I said , " We 're going to bring it out . "
I do this with the friends of those <unk> and <unk> .
And that 's exactly what I want to do is to make a change in the world .
Okay , so my time is not a little bit harder .
I 'd like you to stand up with the name of a British bear in England , and she 's <unk> , because I have the opportunity to come here .
And I emailed this song to tell you how big it is for me to make a difference .
And she came to my country and saw the importance of <unk> in <unk> .
She said that the only way to help save women is to invest in women 's education , and they can have a revolution in this complex country .
She was married to one of the founders of <unk> <unk> .
She saved over 150 children volunteers .
I 'm one of those .
I would like you to have a <unk> for me right now to sing a <unk> .
Are you ready .
Okay , ready .
Okay .
♫ This is a <unk> for <unk> ♫ ♫ That 's a Friday afternoon , she 's like <unk> , and I can come here , because you 're going to get out of the world , but I 'll be able to say , " Why do n't you go to me ? ♫ And I 'd like to go and get it , ♫ I 'm gon na have to be a little <unk> because , if I could n't get to the list , I would be just like , ' What 's wrong with the <unk>

And at the end of the day , in my seven birthday birthday , I had my mother , and I saw my mom in the <unk> , my dad , when they found that I came up on the kitchen and said , " Hey , <unk> . "
My dad said to me , " You know what that means , right ? "
I said , " Of course , I 'm going to have a birthday , and I 'll get a lot of gifts . " My dad says , " Yes , my dad said .
But more importantly , seven years later , it means that seven - year - old age is that you have access to all the <unk> God and humankind .
And I heard about the age of gravity .
At my time , my sister 's sister had been rejected with me , but that was just the college class of school , and when she talked about this word , it was because of the word " <unk> of <unk> , " and all of a sudden we 're all <unk> for the first time for our first generation of religion , which is that I 'm really concerned about it .
So I say , " Okay , that 's the age of <unk> , what does it mean ? "
And my dad said , " We believe in our <unk> , we think God knows that God does n't have the capacity for children , but you already have this ability .
You grew up , and you go to rational age , now , God will start recording your behavior , the records will become your <unk> . "
And I said , " Oh , yeah , so what do you mean today , I 've always been a vegetarian , but God never noticed ? "
And she said , " Ah , but I 've got it . "
And I thought , " How could I not know that ?
And they always tell me , how do I do that ?
As long as possible , it did n't have a lot of money .
And the worst thing was , I did n't see the fact that it was n't used to me . "
And then I said , " <unk> , what ?
I mean , do n't you know what you 're doing , right ?
And the dad said , " Yes , but I think that 's just swimming in Thanksgiving and Christmas . "
And her mother said , " Look , Bob , straight directly .
And you see , she 's seven years old , and Julie , the world has no idea . "
Actually , I did n't have a lot of <unk> .
My parents have been touched by the story of <unk> : how do they talk to people , and they 're trying to figure out how to do it at the bottom of the season , to make them open up in Christmas .
<unk> him in the morning at Christmas Day , when we 're in <unk> , and we do n't have a lot of problems for any problem .
And that was a very confused day .
And obviously , it 's actually our parents presenting us .
The dad has a very unique <unk> of <unk> , and my mother is so close to the <unk> .
And then , how do you go back to the rest of the house that 's going to go back and go back to our home , so how do you <unk> ?
And this is a whole bunch of evidence , and I came up with a clear conclusion : we did n't have a surprise . Even the <unk> does n't want to sit , my parents were just trying to protect us in our house , but the truth was that he was not happy to be happy . But what was he like to do is to judge others .
So , for finding the fact that <unk> does n't exist .
And when I leave the kitchen , I 'm not particularly surprised to be a little bit of <unk> , and how I 'm going to make the idea of " <unk> " is a little bit better .
Now , it 's been late for me , but I might help others , those who need this data .
They 're going to get two conditions : one , their older age is , they 're not able to understand the concept of " rational age " -- two , and they do n't have seven .
The answer is obvious : my brother Bill . He 's six .
I found a Bill <unk> in <unk> , and he was in a public school . This was a painter Bill .
And I went to him and said , " Bill . "
I realized that the <unk> age began when you were seven years old , and since you 've got seven weeks earlier , you have the ability to <unk> God , who said , " Well , what do you do ? " And that 's what you 're going to do for a year . ' " So , I do n't know what it is . "
But when I went to the highest level , I was <unk> around and said , " Yes , Bill , <unk> does n't exist . "
But I did n't know that my seven birthday was n't true in September .
And I had a <unk> party for my birthday , but a few weeks ago , my mother took me down , and she said , " I 'm going to tell you something about you .
Your birthday is n't nine months , 10 months . " I said , " What ? "
And she said , " Listen to me , <unk> asked me to be born at nine a.m. "
" So I tell them your birthday is September <unk> , but I 'm not sure you 're going to tell someone you real birthday , so I 'll tell you , you 've got the birthday .
<unk> , you 've got to go to school , and honey . Absolutely completely . "
And I thought , when I was four years old , I had four kids , and there was another child in my mother 's stomach , so she meant that she had to go back to school , but she said , " Do n't worry about it , she 's going to have to do something that you do n't want to take a cake .
That 's what I felt like , but it was very sad .
My mother 's been singing with me and celebrate birthday .
And this is really a question that really bothers me , not because I have to tell me all the good sons , I need to change the date of my party , and that means that I 'm not glamorous .
And I 've got a big <unk> in my face , and I read my daily sister every day .
And now it 's <unk> , and I 'm <unk> ?
And so I went to the bus and bought new <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , and it 's just a big <unk> in <unk> .
At the time , I was born in girls , and I had more <unk> than other girls and said , " Well , when I know my <unk> is a <unk> , it 's <unk> .
But I also bought the new <unk> and started reading my new book , and I found that it describes it completely .
Until a few years later , when I came back to thinking about the whole " " <unk> age " -- I did n't think I was seven years old , and I would n't have seven percent of the time before I thought I had seven months old . At God , I have a whole month to do anything about it .
Ah , life is cruel .
And one day , two <unk> of <unk> came to me .
And when I was in the day of Los Angeles , there was all the people who were traveling in this neighborhood , and there was all the people who were walking around .
Sometimes the <unk> of Jesus taught me that they 're going to show me some of the roots of heaven .
And sometimes , some of them were <unk> , they laughed for the magazine , and they would n't join the <unk> , they would n't <unk> .
And because of this , I did n't have to go to it , but it was a day of the door .
And two - year - old boys are standing there , and the little leopard <unk> in the temple , the <unk> leader of his <unk> , said that they 're teaching me to <unk> .
And I said , " <unk> me ? From God ? " they say , yes . "
I grew up with a lot of people in the Pacific , and the people who come from God know ? I 've been working with them , but I have never really learned that they 're going to talk about their <unk> or they say , " You know , I 'm just a bit of curiosity . I think it 's really cool .
I asked them to sit down , give them a early water -- OK , I 've done it for them .
My hair , I know .
You ca n't let me look at my love and hope I do n't have my hair .
Now , I 'm going to sit down and sit at the table and give them a thousand fresh water , and then they say , " You believe God is <unk> you ? "
And I thought , " Of course , God , but , you know , ? I do n't like the word " soul , because God seems to be <unk> , and I 'm not like that " he has sex .
But I do n't want to argue with those boys , so it 's very sad , and I said , " Yeah , yeah , I feel God . "
They <unk> , and it 's all right . And they say , " Do you believe that we 're all brothers and sisters ? "
And I said , " Yeah , yeah , I believe . " I 'm really pleased with the question that I can answer .
They said , " We have a story for you . "
And then I came up with a guy who talked about <unk> , who was Lincoln in Jerusalem .
And obviously , in the <unk> of six years of <unk> , everyone is bad , evil is evil . Everyone , women , baby , <unk> .
And God came up to <unk> , and he said , " <unk> your family . I 'll leave you here . " God is really asking them .
They brought them to America .
I said , " Well , what about the United States ? In the <unk> , from the ' 80s ? "
They said , " Yeah . "
And then they tell the <unk> of <unk> and his age , 600 years later , they divided two <unk> : every single person in <unk> , and every person who is good at each person , everybody is very happy with each other , everyone 's evil .
At the time , it 's been dead in love , because the <unk> of the human race is going to stop in the U.S.
<unk> people are very , very nice , and every single one of them is so <unk> to <unk> .
But obviously , there 's a lot of <unk> to kill all the <unk> .
There 's only one <unk> of <unk> , because he hid in the forest .
And he took this whole story to the <unk> of Egypt in <unk> , and it 's going to <unk> in <unk> , New York , New York .
I sat in the edge of the chairs .
And I said , " What 's the <unk> ?
And they say , they become the American <unk> .
And then I said , you do n't believe that our Americans are the ones who are <unk> , they say , yes !
And then they told me that there was a guy called Joseph Smith who found it in his <unk> , and he found a piece of paper , which he was able to put his face into his mouth and then <unk> himself into the <unk> of English .
Now , I just wanted to give these two young people about their labor skills .
And I said , " Well , let 's start with this story .
I mean , even if you 're in the beginning , it 's going to give you a character test , and you have to tell people about <unk> , the ones who are the highest ones .
And they say , " Well , you believe God is by <unk> by the prophet who is <unk> us ? No , I do n't believe it . I do n't believe it .
Because the story of the <unk> leading me some crazy <unk> , but the truth is , I do n't think about the whole story . So , what do you say ?
Anybody else ? They might be women ?
And they said , " No way , I ask why ? They say , because God has given Women a gift of women , and it 's the only gift that <unk> the man 's abilities to the men .
So , I 'm thinking , well , what about God 's gift ?
Is it possible that they 're much more useful than men and <unk> ?
Or women are older than women , or women do n't have the violence ? But these are n't women .
And they say that women are pregnant .
I said , <unk> , watch a minute . Even if women are 15 years old , they do n't have a child , and they 're not going to die at the age of eight year - olds to listen to God .
Now , I do n't think they 're teenagers and cute , but they still continue to say .
And also , we believe that you 're not even <unk> , but still to church and reputation , and you can still go into heaven , until you die .
And then I said , " God , that 's not a good motivator .
And they say , you know what ? We believe that when you get to heaven , your body will come back to the first state .
For example : If you have fewer <unk> , you go back to heaven .
Or if you 're blind , you 'll be <unk> .
I said , " Well , that 's a few years ago , because of the cancer , I lost the uterus , which means I 'm going to get out of heaven ? They say yes .
And I said , I do n't want him back , and I 'm happy .
My God , if somebody did his nose and was very interested in the nose ?
Can God leave you with the nose to the left ?
And then they give me a book of my book , and let me read this chapter , which tells me that they will come back and look at me and see me , I think , my answer is : No , no , do n't wait . They leave it .
And so that 's the beginning of my mind , and I think it 's more than two boys , but I do n't think more about my normal faith .
And if someone came to my house , I thought I 'd advertise the theory of the <unk> , and they would say , " We believe God makes a young girl , which is a very , very important thing to do with the girl who has a child , but it 's a really important deal to make a baby .
And I used to use this story .
So I do n't think of myself as two boys .
But they ask me to ask my question when I really believe that God feels a love love for me ?
I 'm not sure that I feel like this .
But if they ask me questions : Can you feel God 's love ?
And that would be completely different . I think I 'll have a <unk> answer that 's true , yes , I 've always felt that God 's love when I feel the love of <unk> and conservatives that I ca n't feel like I could n't understand , while I can not understand why it 's going to happen to me . When I do n't know why , God is <unk> .
But based on their problems , I do n't believe a little bit about safety , because I 'm really sure whether I believe I feel my feeling .

And he said , " I have a dream . "

And my dream is that we do n't think that the future will be an <unk> , and it 's a challenge for us , because if you think about all of the world 's future , almost everything is catastrophic .
And I thought , " It 's a very scary movie to show people the most <unk> movie .
And from the film , it 's made very glamorous , but all of the <unk> , everything is dead .
There 's only a couple of years of trying to live in the way .
And I also feel like I 'm involved in the movement , and I 've been building this kind of view of what the future is .
In a period of time , we 're going to have a <unk> view of what happens .
We 're going to focus on the worst .
We 're going to focus on the problem .
We do n't think about how to fix these problems .
You can say , we 're using fear for fear .
And any <unk> would tell you that it 's going to be <unk> in life .
This is when a animal feels that fear is part of the struggle of combat or <unk> -- imagine a <unk> .
A <unk> stop frozen , preparing preparation preparation .
And I think that 's exactly what we 're doing , when we ask people to join our understanding of our environment .
People stop , and they 're ready to kill , because we use fear as tools .
I think the movement is going to grow up , and start thinking about what we mean .
How do you improve life ?
And I think one of the problems that we 're dealing with is the people who manipulate the market : it 's based on the definition of progress , which is to define progress . And they say , in some ways , they 're going to increase the value of some kind of stuff , as we make something appropriate , and then we 'll be able to do it .
And this is something that comes from a certain point of view of human beings rather than fear -- <unk> .
In fact , in the West , we have a lot more .
Maybe part of the world is <unk> , but we have a lot of money .
And we 've also learned that this is not a good measure of health care .
In fact , our art designer , Simon <unk> , said , " A national interest in the <unk> of the country is not derived from that country . "
But what we do is we create the accounting system for the productivity and the manufacturing industry .
Indeed , maybe the productivity standards in my life is used .
In the ' 80s , we have to make a lot of stuff .
Indeed , what we did was we had a lot of success in the building that we destroyed Europe , and then had to <unk> .
So our nation - <unk> institutions are only computation that we can produce .
But before 1968 , this <unk> man , Robert <unk> , who did n't have the president of the United States at the beginning of his country , <unk> the U.S. GDP .
And he ended up following his talk on his presentation , and he said , " GDP per capita , no measure what makes life really valuable . "
Is n't it absurd ? We measure standards , the most important criteria we 've measured in social progress , measuring everything , it does n't measure what makes life meaning ?
And I think , if you 're still alive today , he will ask us that these <unk> are going to come to society to find what makes life value .
And he 's going to ask us to redefine our country , to make sure that it makes it important , like social justice and justice , <unk> , and people 's happiness .
And in fact , <unk> are already asking these questions around the world .
This is a global study .
It asked people , what do they want .
<unk> , people around the world said they 're happy and happy , they have their own , their families , the joy of their community , and their happiness and happiness .
Well , they think money is important .
And this is true , but it 's much smaller than the joy of happiness .
We need to love love and belonging .
The amount of money is smaller than health .
We all want health care .
These are people who are inspired by humans .
Why do n't you measure these things ?
Why do n't we think about the progress of the state , rather than only computation , how much material we have ?
Indeed , this is the same thing that I 've been doing -- which is thinking about how we measure happiness and happiness , how to measure <unk> and kindness and how do we do that .
In places where I go to work , the new economic Foundation , we asked a world called the Earth 's happiness , because we think people should delight happiness .
Why do n't we make an estimate of progress ?
And what we 're doing is that we refer to the final estimate of a nation - state , which is how successful it is to live in their civic lives .
And this goal is to be the goal of every country in the world .
But we have to remember it 's a fundamental element , and that 's how we use the Earth 's resources .
We have only one planet , and we need to share it .
This is a planet that we share with our shared <unk> diet .
It 's very interested in the stuff of <unk> .
And when it has an extremely weak resource , it 's going to turn it into a radical consequence of productivity .
It will account for what we 're going to pay for us .
And this instinct is to measure how much of the Earth 's resources can enhance the amount of happiness .
This is a <unk> standard standard .
And maybe the easiest solution is to look at this image .
This image is called " eco - <unk> , " which is a measure of how many <unk> we use to use our own pressure .
This is <unk> .
It 's a standard <unk> , it 's called " happy Life . "
This is an standard standard of happiness .
It 's a lifetime of life for happiness .
That 's the quality of all countries .
That <unk> , the average average .
Now there are many countries around the world .
And in this painting , there are some good countries on the corner of the graph , but the price is really good for them to make a lot of resources .
There 's a couple of other countries in the United States , in those <unk> , and some of the <unk> countries .
The opposite , in the lower corner of this graph , is the country that does n't offer -- the typical state of Africa is <unk> sub - Saharan Africa .
In terms of Thomas <unk> , life is short and robust .
There are only 40 years of life in these countries .
You know , malaria is a lot of life .
Now that 's a good news for you .
And some of the countries in this room , the yellow triangles are doing better than the average average , in the upper six .
This is an inspiring image .
We 're going to get to the map , and there 's good life that does n't raise the Earth .
Those are American countries .
And in the top of the diagram , the country is a place where I do n't go to .
Maybe some of you have been there .
<unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> is <unk> .
That 's the country .
And according to the latest Gallup poll , they are the most happiest countries on Earth -- they 're happier than anyone and the Denmark , the Danish and Germany .
They 're the most happy places .
But they use one quarter of the world 's resources , only as a quarter resource .
So what happens ?
What 's different ?
We can look at some data .
They 're 99 percent of the energy from 2020 .
Their government was one of the first promise of <unk> and the government that had done before 1982 .
They launched the military in 1949 , 1949 .
They invest in social projects , health and education .
They have a lot of money in Latin America in the world .
And they have the underlying grain of <unk> , right ?
They have social skills .
And this challenge is , maybe we might have thinking about what we 're going to think about -- it 's probably not about the North , maybe not <unk> .
Maybe it 's the Latin American .
And the real challenge is , <unk> the global average .
That 's what we have to do .
If we 're going to do this , we need to paste on the bottom of the world , and we have to put it on the right .
So we 're starting to start building a happy planet .
This is an approach to this .
Another way of looking at this happiness is to look at the history of history .
We do n't have a good data to go back to every country in the world , but we 've got a lot of different kinds of data in the world .
And this is the trend of the period of <unk> , which is a small improvement , but it 's an ecology of ecology .
So , from the opposite of happiness , we 're going to transform rare energy into the amount of levels that we want .
And the point here is that , I think , maybe every single person in this room wants us to get our societies to 2050 - to - 2050 .
This is not very distant from us .
That 's just half of the lives .
A kid is going to school in 2050 , when it 's 2050 .
This is not a remote future .
This is based on the goal of carbon dioxide in the U.K. and greenhouse gas .
I tell you , this is n't <unk> <unk> .
That means we have to change things .
It means that we have to change the way we create organizing strategies , the methods of life .
And the point is that we have to live high - life happiness .
There is no person who 's going to vote for the quality of life .
I think no one will want to stop progress .
I think we all want to do this .
I think we all want to be a better man .
And I think that 's exactly why you have <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And I think that 's what they 're going to do , and they need to live .
They want to get all of them .
And if we 're going to get rid of them , those are the ones that we need to do .
That means that we really need to get further from our efficiency .
There are graphs or things that are easy to make , but the point is that we 're going to turn those curves upside down .
This is the place that I think we need to learn from the system and engineers , and they create feedback engines in the right time .
And people are easy to see , " <unk> . "
So for example , you put a smarter relaxation in the house when you see the touch of how much energy you 're using and tell you how to spend it , and your kids are going to close the lights .
What kind of apply to social applications ?
Why in the news of God , I 've heard about London 100 degrees of <unk> , the Netherlands - <unk> Index of the <unk> industry -- and I do n't know who the dollar is so good for the car .
Why do we hear that ?
Why do n't I hear how much it was done yesterday , or the U.S. yesterday ?
Do we have a year - to - one swath of measuring annual annual annual impact ?
This is an approach to a common goal .
You bring it to media and start thinking .
And we need a positive feedback circuit to improve happiness , and in the government , they can build <unk> <unk> .
In the business of business , you can see whether your employees are <unk> , and we know that this is directly relevant to creativity , but we 're going to need a lot of innovation to confront the environmental problems .
In the individuals , we need these statements .
Maybe we do n't need the data , but we need to remind .
In England , we have a strong understanding of the public health account , every day , eating fruits and vegetables , and how much exercise we 're going to do -- I 'm not very good at it .
What do we do with happiness ?
Is n't it possible that we should be doing it every day ?
A few years ago , we did a project for government technology , a big project called " <unk> , " lots of people -- a lot of experts -- all the way -- it 's a <unk> .
And that part of what we do is , what do you do ?
And this is the point that they are , and they 're not just saying that the secret to happiness , but I think happiness will arise from those active activities .
The first thing is , with the people to touch , it 's the most important bedrock of your life .
Are you paying attention to the amount of time you love .
You have to start building these relationships .
The second is : keep active .
And the best way to get rid of bad <unk> is : walk out , <unk> a piece of radio , and <unk> the music .
Keep active is very helpful to keep the good thing .
Number three : concern around around .
Do you care about what 's going on in the world , and you notice , you know ?
Do you notice anything you have in the <unk> ?
In many studies , the evidence of perception , <unk> psychology , is very powerful for our health .
<unk> : It 's very important to learn . They 're important -- long - term , <unk> .
The elderly people who have learned that they have curiosity , their health , their health , are much better .
But it does n't need to be <unk> ; it 's not about learning knowledge .
But more importantly to keep curiosity .
And this can be a <unk> , and that 's the kind of instrument that <unk> you with the instrument of <unk> .
<unk> learning .
And the final thing about the last thing is the economics of economics , which is to give and to deliver .
Our generosity , our sympathy , compassion , is our foundation , directly with the reward in our head .
We feel good when we give you this .
You can do a experiments , in the morning , for a hundred dollars per day .
You make a group of people to spend their money on their own lives , and then they make money in others .
At the end of the day , you <unk> their happiness , and they spend a lot of delight in people who are happy to spend on people .
We put this five - way approach on these <unk> , and I 'm going to say , that 's not the resource of the Earth .
Because they do n't have carbon .
It does n't need to be much more glamorous .
So I think that 's really practical , and I do n't need to sacrifice the Earth .
Martin Luther King was a good talk to his death at night .
And he said , " I know that the road is full of challenge , and maybe I do n't fear , but I do n't care .
I 've got the hills . I 've seen <unk> . "
And he 's a butterfly missionary , but I believe that the environmental movement is actually <unk> , and the government needs to go into the mountain and they need to be able to see the future , or they 're all going to have a global world that we all want to think about .
Not that , we need to create a number of things to get there , and we also need a lot of good things in this path .
Humans want to be <unk> .
Use these five activities to happiness .
We also need <unk> to bring people together , telling them that happiness is so happy .
So , I think we can build a world that we all want to do , one that does n't need access to the world .
<unk>
<unk> - <unk> <unk> in India was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 , and she talked about her story . Her story is not just about the disease , but she showed the audiences to keep her disease . She shows the <unk> of his audiences .
cancer , <unk> , music , performance , personal growth , storytelling
<unk>
Yves <unk> fights cancer
So , there 's a lot of <unk> about India , and most of us are born in <unk> .
When I was four years old , I learned this song on my mom 's lap .
And that 's exactly what she 's going to get into the dance , and this is the beginning of my journey with India .
From now , it 's 40 years since now -- I do n't have the best dancers of the world , to teach young dancers and old dancers , <unk> , collaborating , cooperate , collaboration , education , work , and my art , achievement , doing it .
In 2007 , I 've got the Grand Canyon of <unk> , which I have a fourth year that 's leading to the kitchen for civic <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
But anything that makes me feel at the end of the conference , I 'm going to learn about seven months in the next seven months .
I learned a word " <unk> . "
<unk> , breast cancer .
And I sat in my doctor 's offices , and I 've heard some other words , " cancer , " " <unk> . "
At the time , the tumor was nine years old , and I was a friend of my friends , " <unk> . "
And that day , I realized that I had a very popular , <unk> , new <unk> .
As a romantic love , I know nine <unk> , courageous , <unk> and <unk> .
I think I know what fear is .
And that day , I learned what was fear .
And all of a sudden , everything was completely missing , and had a lot of <unk> , a lot of <unk> , who said , " <unk> husband , <unk> . "
And I said , " What 's the end ? Is this my life ? "
Is this my dance ending ?
But he , his optimistic soul , says , " No , this is just a gap , and you 're going to go back and do something good .
And I came up with my own life , and I was just able to control it for three things , but my mind , my emotions -- the vision of the imagination and the assumptions that made that sense of action .
So now I 'm very frustrated with this kind of emotion , and I think it 's a kind of a sense of <unk> , and that 's what I want to do .
I 'm going to get to my view of what I think is , to achieve this goal .
I need a force that can come out of my pain .
So I went down to the world and I said to the world .
And I said , " Well , cancer is just a page of my life , and I wo n't let this page the rest of my life .
And I 'm going to show you the world , and I will not let it go to me .
But I have to rely on my expectations .
And I need a picture of it , and I 'm going to start on this process and start out there .
And then I found it from dance , and my force , my power -- my <unk> <unk> .
But it 's not easy .
Believe me , this is not easy .
You 're going to be able to depend on the beauty of the beautiful , three - thirds of your <unk> .
Are you fighting with despair in your body , when you 're going to hit the <unk> of a <unk> for three hours of <unk> to me ?
You 've misunderstood because pain and despair .
And what I want to do is <unk> <unk> .
But I always told me that it 's not what I 'm going to do .
So <unk> to my dance , my body , thoughts , the soul , every day , I 've learned all of the things that I learned about four from four to four new jobs , <unk> , learning , new organization , from new tissue .
This process is painful , but I 've done it .
It 's difficult .
I focused on my head to focus on the <unk> of my dance and the philosophy of <unk> and romantic romantic philosophy .
And slowly , I got rid of my heart .
But I need other things .
I need to increase my journey on the image , and I found it from four years of my time .
<unk> <unk> on the images of God
<unk> <unk> : <unk> by India 's <unk>
<unk> <unk> were glamorous , and her 18 arm had been struggling to fight her arm , she entered her <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 's symbol of power or women
<unk> soul .
And I did this image of <unk> <unk> and her properties and all of the <unk> that I had .
And in her mysterious symbol , with my passion for training , I 'm like a <unk> focused on my dance , as an aircraft , and then I danced for a couple of weeks after the surgery .
And I also dance in the <unk> cycle of <unk> and <unk> .
I dance in the chemotherapy and the olives , and I was <unk> him and <unk> my dance cycle .
And what I did was I was approaching my dance focused on my romantic dance .
Yes , cancer becomes a page of my life .
And my story is a story of a challenge to overcome <unk> disorder and challenge .
My story is the power of ideas .
My story is the power of choice .
It 's the power of attention .
This is a force that allows us to look at what 's going to depend on our vitality , and we 're starting to make cancer .
My story is <unk> .
It 's the power of images .
And my image is <unk> <unk> .
She 's called the <unk> bomb .
In the process of my life , I took my own <unk> force , my <unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> myself and collaborating with the war that I had to deal with with cancer , so I 'd like to get rid of the civil war , but I hope that it 's not as cancer as a disease .
I 'm going to show you a little bit about my dance .

20 years ago , <unk> Lee invented the World Wide Web , and in his next project , he 's building a open - open , white , photography , video - based data : releasing our data .
business , communication , design , invention , technology , web
<unk>
Yves Berners - Lee 's next generation
<unk>
It 's about 20 years ago when I think we use information , I invent the World Wide Web .
Over 20 years , now , in TED , I ask you to help create new structures .
Let me go back to <unk> in <unk> , and I 'm making a global <unk> system .
There are almost no people who are actually using it .
But , 18 months later -- innovation is the same 18 month months , the boss said , I can do this kind of thing .
And he wrote a lot of time to write the code .
I 've got the next <unk> of what 's going to look like -- <unk> - <unk> -- the <unk> idea -- things are called <unk> .
I did this code and revealing .
Why do I do that ?
This is a process of <unk> .
I feel very proud of it -- because I 've been working on a lot of the high - tech research in this exciting , exciting laboratory in the world .
They 're different computers .
<unk> different platforms are different .
So there 's a huge amount of money , if I want to build a little bit of stuff on these , I 'm going to find some data , and I have to connect some new kinds of equipment that I can find in a new way .
These are n't <unk> .
It was very <unk> .
This <unk> is also showing the potential of this project .
In fact , these <unk> are full of collectors .
So if you look at some of the large <unk> of these large avatars , like the Internet life , it 's a very simple world .
So once you have this idea , even if people do n't read your " <unk> , " because he 's dead , it 's in his <unk> .
He said to his corner , " <unk> , but very exciting . "
But in general , it 's hard to tell the idea of what the Internet is .
Now it 's all difficult to explain , more explanation .
But anyway , when TED starts , there was no network , so it was different than a click .
I can now show someone a bunch of <unk> on a page that contains links , and we click a link and then <unk> -- <unk> to another <unk> page .
Nothing really impressive .
We 've seen that , through <unk> , find the contents of the CD .
The hard thing is that it 's a link that you can imagine , so that links can be able to imagine the actual document .
Well , this is a little bit harder for people to do .
However , some people do .
It 's hard to explain , but it 's a continuum of <unk> .
That 's where it 's fun .
It 's the most exciting thing that is not technology , it 's not people who use it , but in fact , all of these people respond together , and they 're sending email to email .
This is what happened .
Do you know what ? Well , it 's fun .
And I asked each person , and I said , " Can you tell me that you can put your <unk> on the Web ? "
And then you do something .
Thank you .
This is a <unk> , right ?
I mean , it 's been really interesting because we found that the Internet does n't get us out there .
And now it 's much more designed than we think about it , just to put it together in the first place where we start using networks .
And I want you to put your data on the Internet .
There 's a huge amount of <unk> .
And there 's a huge amount of <unk> , because we 've got data from the Internet .
What 's the difference ? What difference between <unk> and data ?
<unk> is what you read .
You 've all read , you can read their link . That 's it .
Data : You can use all sorts of data with a computer .
Who else knows that Hans Rosling 's talk : " <unk> <unk> " ?
A great thing -- many people have seen -- a great TED talk .
And Hans Rosling is using different colors in his display , different countries , and he 's shown in a line where he shows the baby mortality .
And he uses this data to get a talk , and this talk is <unk> a lot of people in the developing world .
And he shows a similar slide .
The data is covered in the ground , and the data was these brown , boring and boring , right ?
Because you ca n't use data , but in fact , data <unk> our lives because some people use the data and doing things .
In this case , Hans Rosling is going to put data together in the United States , found all kinds of data and things .
And he put this data together and put it together , so much more interesting than the raw data , and then it 's going to put the data on this software , which I think is the end of his son .
And finally Hans Rosling said , " Look , there 's a lot of data . "
And I 'm happy to see that in the <unk> of yesterday , he 's still <unk> , " There 's a lot of data . "
Now what I want you to think about is not only the link between two data , or it 's like a six - year - old data -- anyone in the world , and nobody is able to put the data on the Web and <unk> them .
This technology is connected , and it 's extremely simple .
And if you want to put something in the network , there 's three rules that you need to do , and it 's the name of <unk> , which is that we 're not doing something about it .
We do this in the context of the iPhone , and we do it .
All of the stuff that 's called <unk> is starting to start called <unk> .
And the second law , if I have a <unk> B , and then I 'm going to look at it on the Internet and I 'll get some criteria from the Web , where I can get a little bit of <unk> data .
And what happens is , who 's the person who has all the information about this person ?
So the second rule of <unk> is that I 've got a lot of data through my <unk> .
And the rule is , I 've got information that 's not just a high amount of information , but the amount of relationships between people and the streams of data , the data .
The data is connected .
Very interesting , data is connected .
This man was born in Berlin , 2011 .
When the data is connected , regardless of it , it 's a relationship with the other things that you have , and it 's starting to start called <unk> .
So , I can go directly .
For example , one of the people in the city -- he 's born city , cities , urban towns , etc .
So I 'm going to zoom in these information .
That 's true .
This is the connection .
And I was calling it a few years ago in a newspaper called " <unk> data . "
The idea of <unk> data is like we 've got lots of things that Hans have , so many things start growing .
It gives us a lot of plants .
It 's not just a plant supply for each plant for every plant , regardless of what it is , a analysis , some people watch the pattern , and they 're all looking at data , which is very important that the data is really important and how you connect a lot of things that are more important .
So , connection .
<unk>
So quickly , Chris <unk> from Berlin , who did this for the first person to make fun of fun , and he noticed that Wikipedia has a lot of fun <unk> a online encyclopedia .
In these <unk> , some little <unk> and the box .
In many ways , it 's data .
And he wrote a program that 's going to bring data from Wikipedia , and then you put it in the <unk> data .
This slide here is in the middle of the summer , if you go to Afghanistan , you find that there are other data of data , and they 're connected together .
So if you want to get out of the data , you 're ultimately going to end up with the other thing .
And what 's exciting is that it 's grown up .
This is a <unk> thing , right ?
Let 's think about data .
And the data is actually derived from many different forms of the Web , so it 's important to think about the diversity of networks that allow you to put the data together .
<unk> : I 'll say a lot of data .
And we can say that governments are really important , and also scientific data , personal data . A lot of data about what 's going on in the dialogue , the data and the news .
I just mentioned a few pieces of data , and you can see the diversity that you see here .
Let 's start with government data .
Let 's go from government data to the Internet data .
The governments in the United States will be used in one form of forms .
And that 's really important , is n't it ?
It 's not just about the fact that governments are important to governments , especially from government data , to think about how much relationships are in the U.S.
It really matters , really valuable .
I could use it in my company .
And I could use it as a kid in my afternoon .
So what we 're talking about is , let 's talk about the world , to make the data more useful .
In fact , if you 're in responsibility / <unk> , when you know some of the data about governments , you often find some people , they 're going to be <unk> by these figures .
You <unk> your database , you do n't walk into it until you make a beautiful website .
Well , what I want to suggest is , besides building a beautiful website , it 's constructed , and I do n't say , " Do n't build a nice website .
<unk> a beautiful website , first of all , we need data .
We 're going to have a pure data .
Okay , now we have to ask the details .
I want you to accept , OK ?
Say , " <unk> . "
Gorgeous primitive .
Please say this .
Data .
Please talk now .
Now now ...
Okay , data .
The raw data is now .
This exercise is very important because you do n't know how many people have access to data , and you 're not going to make money for you as a professional person .
It 's not only the American , it 's the world .
Not only the government , of course , in the corporate world .
I want to talk about other ideas about data .
In TED , we 've continued to focus on the great problems of human society , cancer therapy , understanding that the <unk> disease is understanding about the economy .
And those who are trying to solve these problems , they do n't have the idea of their own brain , and they 're trying to communicate in the Web .
But what happens is that a lot of human knowledge is now in the database , and in fact , in their computers , they 're actually not being shared .
In fact , I 'm going to tell you from one aspect of the way -- if you 're in a research disorder , it 's a lot of variation in the drug -- and this area is very , very <unk> , because the scientists realize that connection is a very good approach , which is really a good way to help them get access to the data because they 're building a group of data on a database of groups .
Now , they 're going to form <unk> data from the protein data data , and they can ask the question , maybe you do n't ask me , but they will not ask .
Who is proteins for <unk> and <unk> ?
And then you put this problem on Google .
Nature does n't answer the answer , because nobody asked the question before .
But you get a <unk> , but you do n't have one .
But none of you do n't have it -- now they 've got the <unk> of 32 units , and every result is related to the characteristics and you can see it .
To make a scientist , the ability to ask questions is essentially a real C - <unk> problem .
It 's very , very important .
The scientists were completely <unk> because other scientists elected the data , and it was worth <unk> , so we needed to deal with these big problems .
Now , if I continue to continue like this , you do n't have a relationship with you .
But this idea is n't true .
In fact , data is about our life .
You just sampled your social network , and you 're the most favorite , you say , " This is my friend . "
<unk> ! <unk> , data .
You say , " This man , this guy 's " <unk> " . That 's data . Data , data .
And every time you do what you 're doing in social networks , the mesh networks are <unk> and use it to design the data for the rest of the site .
But when you look at another group of data , <unk> is a traveling website , and you say , " I think I want to bring this picture to the <unk> , but you ca n't get rid of the wall .
And economists wrote a articles about this question , and many people have written a huge amount of <unk> .
The way to break the <unk> is <unk> in these social networks .
We need to do this with connection .
The last one I 'm going to talk about , perhaps the most exciting .
And before I arrived , I found a map in <unk> , and it was a <unk> .
It 's a theater . This is an X - ray -- it 's where we live -- <unk> theater , and now there 's no <unk> .
So I can go and edit the pattern , selected theater , and then it 's on the bottom , and it keeps it .
Now you go to <unk> and you find this place , you 'll find it now .
This is what I do .
I 've done it on the map .
I call it there . Hey , you know what ?
And if I do that , each person is going to have an incredible resource on this map , because everybody else does it every other person 's .
This is the connection .
Everybody does a little amount of stuff , and then they connect them .
This is how it works .
You do some , everybody does something .
Maybe your data is just smaller than the data , but you know you need it .
We 've done it already .
<unk> data -- very big .
I can only tell you that there 's a very small amount of work in every aspect of our lives and happiness , whether it 's the data that goes through it .
When you compare data to the data , you can lose energy from the Web or <unk> .
You can get a huge amount of energy .
And now we have a stage that we need to do -- those who think it 's a great idea .
And all of us -- I think most of you are doing things in the TED conference instead of trying to make the investment immediately , because only when everyone is doing it , they 're going to do this for a lot of people who are willing to engage and make things work .
Okay , here 's the connection .
I hope you 're participating .
I hope you need it .
I think this idea is worth spreading .
Thank you .

" <unk> <unk> " -- Daniel <unk> , for us , is that we do n't have compassion .

Daniel Cohen tells the story of compassion
One of the TED theme of TED is compassion , which allows me to be touched . We 've heard about these moving positions : like the African Africa , the Japanese in Africa .
And I want to talk to you about the level of personal level from the world .
I 'm a psychologist , but let 's not talk about <unk> .
There 's a very important study of research in Princeton , which explains why we have so much opportunity to do it , and we do n't have to help , we 're not going to help , sometimes it does n't help .
A student from Princeton is told that they 're going to take a piece of paper , and the spread of a <unk> theme is a theme .
Half of the theme stories of <unk> is about the story of a bad person : a story about a stranger who helps to help help .
50 percent of the students get random stories .
They 've been told that they 're going to go into a building building .
And at the end of the day they go to the building , each one of them has a <unk> , obviously , who need help .
The more interesting question is : if their theme is about the story of the bad person , there 's a influence on their behavior , and it does n't make any difference .
It determines whether they 're going to stop a stranger who is fully dependent on what they think they are playing , or they 've got their hands to talk about their content .
And that , I think , is our everyday lives : we do n't always have to help others , because our attention existed .
Yves <unk> : Social review
And what 's circled is the <unk> circuit of the people in the process .
And the new idea of <unk> from social <unk> is us .
That means that , if we get older , we go to compassion .
The new evidence that the neurons , the mirror neuron , is like nerve cells , which activates the same regions in the brain , and it activates our brain to each other .
And if that person needs help , if he 's holding his pain , we do n't have to help him . At least this is a argument .
And the question is : Why do n't we help help ?
I think there 's a range of levels from completely <unk> to notice each other , and then compassion , finally , compassion .
And the simple truth is , if we look at ourselves , we do n't have a lot of attention .
This is a very trivial experience for us to interact with other people .
And I was in the donor one day , when I got to <unk> my license , and I noticed that my <unk> -- my friend Larry <unk> had to give money to the <unk> .
And I realized that I had to get paid for <unk> -- I feel happy .
And so I started thinking about the people in the Himalayas , and they 're going to get <unk> , I realized that I came from this kind of experience , a happy love , which I think is a force .
But to look at it and focus on other people , I encourage you all to do it .
You can understand that in the late <unk> .
When I went to a leopard <unk> , I heard two daughters talking about one of these daughters , and this woman said , " My brother is looking for a mate , so he 's trying to figure out a little bit about lightning . "
Ladies and gentlemen , ladies and men come up and communicate with their peers , a clock , every five minutes , and it 's going to end up at the end of the chair , but the women decided , " Well , the woman decided to be able to get rid of it or email it and email this person to the audience . And I know why , I 've never been there .
And every time he sat down , he starts talking about his own situation , never ask each other . "
I 've done some research on the New York Times , and I 'm looking at some of the stories behind the <unk> of some marriage , because they 're interesting . At the study of <unk> <unk> , she says , when she 's in the date , she 's going to give each other .
And the test is , when they 're together , how much of this man would say she had a problem .
And obviously , Mr. <unk> ran through the test , so it had this book .
This is a very small test , and I encourage you to try and try it in a party .
There 's a lot of good opportunities in the TED TED .
There 's the title of the <unk> Business Business Survey in Harvard , and what it 's about is how to work with others . They call you the most basic thing you 're going to do .
There 's a building <unk> in English , which is <unk> , and the people who are talking to us suddenly get rid of the <unk> and <unk> it .
This word is called " <unk> , " which is " Frost " and " Are " in one side .
I think it 's really appropriate . It 's our empathy for us and our hearts .
Yves studies have been studied by fear of fear , and he has this <unk> , the <unk> singer , who was groomed to become an <unk> researcher , but he was entering a little bit of a impact on him .
Anyway , in a little bit of a sense , my <unk> , <unk> <unk> wrote a book about a <unk> book .
This man , a few years ago , brought us to the lives of our lives , and he 's <unk> <unk> .
And before he was arrested , he murdered his <unk> , his mother and his openness to <unk> his five girls .
So my uncle was interviewed this mass , and when he saw him , he realized that he was really <unk> .
One , he 's about seven feet tall .
But that 's not the most horrifying .
And the most scary thing is that his power is over 22 , a absolute genius .
But the object of <unk> and emotions , <unk> , is the understanding of human experience .
They 're made of different parts of the brain .
So , one thing , <unk> <unk> asks a question that he knows about the answer , and how do you do that ?
Is n't you a little compassion ?
These are <unk> murder , and he <unk> them .
And this is a very <unk> answer , " Nah , no . If I feel pain , I wo n't do it .
I do n't have to think about this . I need no idea . "
And I think it 's quite fascinating .
When we look at our own , we 're not going to focus on ourselves .
Imagine that the possibilities of the automobile , imagine the possibility of compassion .
Now , as Bill <unk> says , we 've bought and using objects that are potentially potential .
We 're all <unk> of <unk> .
We do n't notice that we 're not aware of the carpet or the chairs , the <unk> , the <unk> .
Or we do n't know that this <unk> is technology or manufacturing , it can be used by <unk> or <unk> , and , in other words , we stole the ecology of our <unk> and use , public health and social economic justice .
In a sense , the room itself is called " <unk> <unk> , " but we do n't see the victims of it , and we 're not seeing the poetry that we have . Think about it .
Yves <unk> : The <unk> of the <unk>
This is the story of the <unk> story of <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the ancient <unk> , using <unk> <unk> and the soil , and also mentioned , for example , <unk> is very , very tough , about 60 percent of it .
<unk> are familiar with the kids who live in the <unk> of <unk> factories .
There 's this company , <unk> and <unk> , to support <unk> <unk> . The <unk> secret -- and they , because their chief motorcycle knows that it 's going to be used in China , they 're able to ensure that a <unk> factory can do it properly .
Now , we do n't have the ability to choose the power of this moral t - shirt . And how do you do this ? How do you do that ?
Well , I 've been thinking about this . There 's a new <unk> technology that allows anyone to understand the whole history of <unk> <unk> .
You can collect factories . Once you go to the factory , you can understand the process , and know whether it 's moral , that if it does n't make a moral standard , it allows you to do a <unk> , <unk> your hand , put you into a website .
Some people are catching up .
This site can tell you about the object .
That means that we can be able to do a compassion for compassion .
There is a point in the information : the end is what everyone knows about everything .
But the question is : What 's different ?
And I was working on the New York Times , and it was about 80 years in the ' 70s , I wrote a article about New Yorker -- a homeless man in Long Street .
I spent a lot of time to work with an <unk> institution for <unk> , and I realized that most of these homeless people were <unk> . They had a chance to get the right answer to the city , when we ran out of the cities and the people who were looking at the edge of the city .
We did n't notice , we do n't have the dark side .
And after that day , this was a Friday night , and then I talked to the next subway station . At the University of Alabama , people were in <unk> <unk> .
And all of a sudden , when I went down the ladder , I noticed there was a man who did n't wear a <unk> , a diamond , people pulled hundreds of people from him to get out of his way to the people that he pulled away from his , all over the way , where he went through his house , to go through him , pulled from all of him from one person to move out from that point of view , in his face , coming from the outside of the person he was approaching
Because my name is that the city of my city is <unk> , I stopped understanding what 's going on .
I did n't know what he was going to do .
And we found that he was <unk> , and he did n't say English , he could n't get out of the street , in the streets , ended up on the street .
Some people came up to buy the <unk> , and someone had <unk> and somebody brought the lawn police .
And it 's a person who goes down .
It 's just going to be done , so I 'm optimistic .
Thank you .

Richard <unk> : <unk> life on the sky
Chris Anderson : Welcome to TED .
Richard <unk> : Thank you very much indeed for the first time in TED .
<unk> : What kind of fun do you get ?
<unk> : There 's a little bit of fun in this TED .
I 'm happy to see <unk> , because I have to show her .
And about two years ago , I was lucky to work with her , but she had a big <unk> , and I sat down on my hand .
And I went back to home , and I met my wife , she wanted to know why I had another woman , and she had a strong , strong <unk> .
So anyway , we have to go to <unk> , and we have to get rid of it .
So , sorry , <unk> .
<unk> : Very interesting .
Now we 're going to talk a few slides about your company .
And you just had a <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> and <unk> recording , and I heard it starts from a magazine called " <unk> . "
And then we came up with everything . I want to ask you , how do you do it ?
<unk> : I 've read the TED Prize -- and it says no , you ca n't talk about it .
And if I say , you should n't get me down because you ask me .
<unk> : That 's what you 're saying .

I mean , the key to the company is to find the appropriate person to know what they 're doing .
And I 'm interested in learning , but it 's really good to know what I love about the context of trying to try to understand .
So life is a learning process for me .
You know , if I sat down in somebody else 's flight , it 's -- I think , 21 years ago , I thought , <unk> can create a way to make a difference .
And then I bought the 42 <unk> <unk> , and I got a <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> that you 're going to think about , and that 's your <unk> .
In fact , it 's almost impossible to leave you with your <unk> .
And I talked to a investment banker with a banker , and when you 're <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , you 've got <unk> <unk> in the world .
Why do you do that ?
<unk> : Well , I think that 's not only a leopard .
And the cost of building companies is much more powerful than you 're going to be scared .
We were <unk> in Britain .
They want us to tell them that they 're called " <unk> <unk> . "
At the time , I realized that my empire would be possible , unless I did that .
And I 've got to do it for the rest of the encyclopedia , and I have to get to the <unk> record .
<unk> : After the candle , it makes a difference .
<unk> : Yeah , that 's a really good thing .
But it was sad , but we did n't have it .
<unk> : Now your <unk> brands have a whole range of different kinds of partners that you have in your own businesses .
What is the recipe for your mind ?
<unk> : And I think it 's a quality of quality , if anyone else has seen a company , and they 're going to -- <unk> , <unk> -- Richard , who said that quality -- is entrepreneurship ?
<unk> : No , I 'll talk about it anyway .
And our job is <unk> , and I think that employee are very <unk> .
We , as I said , <unk> the other industries , and I think , you know , our attitude is very different .
<unk> : I mean , you 're building a company or not .
So , for example , what does it explain ?
<unk> : We 've never found a sedan .
<unk> : I 'm really curious about -- I have to miss the opportunity for the <unk> industry -- you 've got it called " <unk> . "
And I said , " Well , do n't you let it go ?
And that product group of the product does n't mean the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> : So that 's what we 're going to do .
I mean , we 've been born with the old age of the customer , and it 's a cousin of <unk> .
But in the end of the company , we 've got a letter in three months later , a <unk> , and then I sat down and wrote a long letter on this woman and wrote one of the most <unk> <unk> for the woman .
But obviously , I do n't do anything .
And the six months later , maybe I 've got a very good wake - up guy , and I 'm going to ask a baby who 's going to ask me if I want to do a baby , and I swear to the kids , I love the child .
So it 's a very good story .
<unk> : What do you really need to do ? It 's really fantastic .
<unk> : I 'm supposed to take the photo .
<unk> : Let 's start with a little bit of the <unk> .
Is this numbers ?
What 's the big group ?
How much do you do ?
<unk> : It 's about 250 million .
<unk> : How many employees ?
<unk> : Fifty million people .
<unk> : In different occasions , you 're not going to think of it .
This is what happens ? Is it real ?
<unk> : Yeah . We launched a super seat in Los Angeles .
No , I think , <unk> : What 's your hair ?
<unk> : No .
<unk> : That 's what it is .
<unk> soda .
<unk> : Okay .
<unk> : It 's fun . That 's the interesting trick -- oh , <unk> -- we 're a TED event .
That wo n't be -- can you stay in a few seconds ?
<unk> : It 's really cool , right ?
<unk> : Yeah .
When I first came to the United States , I did n't know what to do with the employees , and they were a little bit curious .

But the question is , is it <unk> , but -- <unk> : <unk> is <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yes .
<unk> : Let 's look at a couple of slides . Yves <unk> . Very good .
Okay , this one . I suppose that 's a trick ?

But she did n't feel bad , she was n't .
<unk> : Yves , you get a reward .
Are you like a Richard <unk> ?
<unk> : No one .
Some people in the United States would say it would be in <unk> .
Just this one .
<unk> : Well , your title can give you any benefit .
<unk> : No , I guess when you have a dyslexic restaurant , there 's something else that 's worth trying to understand .
<unk> : Well , that 's not Richard <unk> ; it 's Richard <unk> .
<unk> : I 'll let my boss adapt .
<unk> : Okay , let 's see the space .
I think there 's a video , and you can tell us that you 're going to get rid of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Is it a license to design ?

That means <unk> 24 months .
<unk> : Is it <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : <unk> designed part of his design , which is designed , and he 's building the center of the building .
And basically his idea is to be a <unk> center , and so , in space , you 'll see a leopard looking at you .
<unk> , you 'll go back to this .
He was designed by design .
<unk> : But you did n't make the engine .
<unk> : There 's a lot of <unk> that I think he does n't design engine .
<unk> : Two days ago , let 's talk about us .
<unk> : It 's true . No , he 's a -- I 'm a <unk> -- somebody thinks that 's really weird .
But , I 'm personally concerned .
<unk> : He 's a wonderful , passionate man , I 'm excited .
<unk> : Well , you 're <unk> the <unk> .
Are you having sex ?
<unk> : There you have <unk>
I mean , <unk> , ship , people did something like that .
And I was six years old to sit in the ocean , so -- every time I had to go home and talk about this experience .
And in those <unk> , you would think , " What 's the most important experience you 've ever seen here ? What you think is <unk> ? Am I going to do it ?
<unk> : I think it 's all about exploration , <unk> is -- every time , we 're all very upset .
First of all , we 've never sat down in front of the Atlantic Ocean , and I 've had to design a high - speed amount of ice vessel ice cream , but we 're also <unk> ourselves in the speed of high speed currents when the balloon hits the ice , where it 's going to be <unk> .
So , when the balloon comes from the <unk> bread , it goes down to the end of the Atlantic , and it 's going to go into the high speed of ice , the big balloon -- the same balloon , which is only about 20,000 square miles of space -- and there are only two hundred meters of <unk> .
It 's like <unk> <unk> .
I was asked by <unk> <unk> , and I 'm not going to hit the balloon , and you 're not going to get lucky .
But every time , the results of the balloon are going to know -- 50 years of all the time to drive my balloon , and this is Doug Engelbart .

<unk> : No , he tells me that <unk> , but once he picks up the boat , it takes a million square miles a gallon .
<unk> : Your risk is inspired by <unk> <unk> .
: Yeah , not , no , I 'm wearing the oxygen <unk> on the wing , and you 've got four steps off the side of the balloon , looking at the fact that there 's a lot of <unk> in the fall -- and I think it 's very wife .
But nonetheless , we 're alive .
<unk> : Are you jumping ?
<unk> : And I knew that there was a six - year - old fuel hour , I know if I danced .
So I went back to the field , and despair crossed itself .
I wrote a little bit about my family , and then I fell up on the underside of the <unk> and looked at the bush and went back to the cockpit .
And finally , there 's a better solution .
You know , I have this big balloon on my head , which is the largest parachute , why ?
So I tried to travel through the clouds , and I went to the ice and landed on the surface of the ice , when I landed on the surface of 50 feet .
And the balloon comes up to the surface , and goes back in the air , but I do n't have the balloon .
But it 's a good thing to do in the ocean -- <unk> : What 's the <unk> of your family ?
<unk> : That 's what people do in that situation , I love you , and I 've just written them in the beginning .
But unfortunately , they did n't have a chance to look at it .
<unk> : The <unk> of your company is very glamorous .
And the first time -- until I 've seen the last time I saw it , you 've got a huge hero in Britain .
The <unk> of the <unk> will say you 're a very good thing to do , and the way you do it is , you get a little bit better .
What about the <unk> ?
<unk> : Of course , Congress would say , as a result , the owner of the Wikipedia is the most important thing to do about the <unk> , and the boat is still a <unk> sea .
<unk> : They said , Richard .
<unk> : In fact , we 've bought the title of the magazine to know , yes , Richard <unk> wants to go through the Atlantic Ocean .
<unk> : So you have to be a big genius , right ?
<unk> : I wo n't reject that .
<unk> : Okay , we 're not going to show you , OK ?
<unk> : Are you kidding ?
<unk> : I 've never read anything . I do n't know anything .
My <unk> was very low .
Maybe it was because I was 15 years old .
If I do n't have any interest , I 'm sure I ca n't understand anything .
This is a very strange thing to read .
I mean , for example , I have to have the largest private private group in Europe , but I do n't have a difference between <unk> and <unk> .
So the conference was a very interesting meeting .
So , what is the good thing to do ?
People say , " Oh , that 's not good .
<unk> : Yeah , it 's about 250 people , right ?

<unk> : No , trust me .
<unk> : There 's one day someone <unk> to 50 years of <unk> , " You see , Richard , let me give you explain to you .
There 's a network that puts fish from the ocean to the ocean .
This little leopard is on the side of your body , and you 're being rejected . "
And then I did it .
<unk> : But in school , <unk> is an <unk> student , and you 're still <unk> and <unk> , you do n't have a <unk> .
So , you 're like , " Well , that 's kind of like a leader of leadership , but a little bit of a <unk> .
<unk> : Well , I 'm a little bit like that , but I -- I 've got a lot of <unk> cells , so I can still be <unk> in some ways .
<unk> : You 've got a lot of <unk> .
I mean , you have a little portrait of his mother , and she said , she 's only four years old ; you 've got to say , " Take home . "
Is this real ?
<unk> : Yeah , I think she thinks we should do it .
So she 's going to do this , and the difference , the way , she gets sent to the police police and she pulls us into the road to get us out of the road , and we 've got five kilometers away .
She also gives us the bicycle .
She never makes us TV .
<unk> : That 's too risky .
And there 's a couple of things that you have in the audience who have kids who are very excited about the adults , and it 's a very <unk> <unk> .
And what you think is that kids are not glamorous , and there 's no intention of compassion .
<unk> : No , I do n't think people are entering their kids , and they 're dressed in the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
I think the best way to do it is not very glamorous .
<unk> : Very good , I think .
And your <unk> said to you -- I mean , he thinks you 're not bad at school , and you do n't say , " You 're going to be a <unk> or a vegetarian , or he does n't know what one is .
So , what 's the first one ?
<unk> : Those are the two things that I 've done .
I 'm a member of the oldest <unk> for Britain .
In <unk> , I was rejected by the <unk> Act , and I was rejected by the <unk> Act .
And the reason for <unk> is that I 'm speaking in the public , " The Lord of the <unk> , " which is in a young church .
There is a problem with a young lady .
There 's this ancient <unk> principle , which is not spoken in the public , and it 's called <unk> , or <unk> .
So , police came to me and told me that I would be arrested if I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
It 's called " social social " and " <unk> " or " The <unk> , " nobody is <unk> .
So , we had the old <unk> <unk> .
And then , " <unk> to his <unk> , we 're <unk> police . "
John <unk> on our military
And he asked me if I could find <unk> .
And I said , " I 'm going to talk to <unk> <unk> .
And the professor said , " Well , <unk> is n't " <unk> . "
And it was a 18 fact that people were singing the <unk> . "
And he said , " Well , I 'm a priest . "
And I said , " Can you come to him ? "
He said he 'd be happy . I said , " No , he said to me that I 'm wearing a <unk> <unk> . "
I said , " That 's good -- trouble . "
<unk> : God .
<unk> : So we 're <unk> -- " <unk> to his priest . "
And then Judge <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , we 're not happy .
<unk> : That 's true .
But really , is that a little bit of a negative ?
A lot of people say that a person is not going to be able to achieve this huge group of groups , unless <unk> <unk> is , for example , thank you .
You 're <unk> .
Some people wrote a book .
Is it real ? Do n't you ?
<unk> : I do n't think they 're going to have to do something about it , usually , not very glamorous .
I think when you 're not shy of people , people will come back and come back .
And I think the <unk> of the world , I think , is very small .
And I think the best thing to do is to make a <unk> , <unk> , justice , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : What do you see in front of your new project ? It looks like you 're a beginner .
You 've got to be a little girl , you know ?
How do you keep your work balance ?
How do you guys think about how you 're going to start a new plan ?
<unk> : I think it 's a very important thing to do with <unk> , when my kids are very , very hours , and when they go out , I 'm following it .
We 've got three <unk> of happiness together .
Yeah , I 'm going to , you know , stay in touch . We 're lucky enough to have a island in the Caribbean , and we can take them -- I can bring them to the real moment of business .
<unk> : You 've begun to start talking about <unk> philanthropy .
So what 's the idea ?
<unk> : <unk> is an effective economic system .
You know , another , <unk> , no work .
But the question of capitalism is -- <unk> <unk> in a few people , so that 's a handful of people . I think , using that wealth .
I think it 's important for anyone who is so fortunate for people who are not going to look at each other , but yet , to know , <unk> can create a lot of jobs to solve the world .
<unk> : What is the most worried that you 're most concerned about ?
<unk> : There 's a lot of problems .
The climate change of the world is a huge problem , and we 're dealing with trying to figure out whether or to try to do it , to find an alternative energy , or a real award , where we do n't have to control the greenhouse flow when we ca n't control greenhouse gas .
We need to encourage you to drink the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere .
We have to -- we need to know that no one has done it before , so we want people to try -- that the world 's best brain , <unk> , and also <unk> methane from the atmosphere .
We have about 10,000 people who want to participate in this .
We just need one solution , which is very promising .
<unk> : And are you in Africa ?
<unk> : Yeah , we 're <unk> a place called wars , which seems bad .
We 're trying -- maybe the name is changing -- anyway , the <unk> rooms try to figure out what 's going on in Africa , trying to find a lot of social problems in the world .
For example , there is a doctor in Africa discovering that the babies of pregnancy are not going to kill HIV / AIDS .
And then it turns out that it 's spread across Africa .
<unk> : The war is very powerful .
And as a hero of the West , it does n't have a risk of risks like this -- I mean , as an advertising , the early age of a race is to make a difference , and most of them are fundamentally functional to solve the problem , and most of them are capable of making it .
And that thinks , in Africa , would n't you have a risk that we could solve , and we can do that , where we 're going to fix the complexities of the complexity of complex problems , but they 're worried about it ?
<unk> : First , we actually -- we 're working with community .
<unk> <unk> is a little bit harder , but it 's about AIDS , and I think that 's also a way to solve this problem , trying to figure out how to deal with it , to try and solve it .
They 're going to make people much better to Africa , so it 's a huge amount of money , and it has to come back for a few years .
It 's the <unk> of <unk> .
But I think that the <unk> of leaders can bring their businesses into the policy of government policy .
So for example , we 've launched clinics in Africa , and we 're going to provide free anti - <unk> drugs and <unk> care and free malaria .
And we 're trying to get these shops , so they 're still going to pay for others .
<unk> : There 's a lot of people who say you 're going to do this with Bill Gates who are just -- basically , it 's basically <unk> , and it is , you know , increase the <unk> of <unk> , rather than <unk> .
How do you say that ?
<unk> : And I think everybody in each person has a reason for all of us , and I feel that when I was seven years old , I felt that I could feel a feeling for the world .
That might be a bit selfish , but I 'm a little bit of that .
I think I have a lot of money to increase the quality of people 's quality of life .
<unk> : Are you older ?
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> said , well , I 'm not saying that I do n't have a specialist , and he says , " Well , people are in 30 and 40 years old .
By 50 , 60 , people would love wisdom and leave his own contribution .
And as you 're concerned about , you are still trying to grow new projects .
How many steps are you going to leave yourself with your own contribution ?
<unk> : What I did .
And of course , I would like to know , my grandmother 's been <unk> , so I have 30 and 40 years , and I have 30 or 40 years .
No , I just want to use life .
To do something for the world , I want to do something about the world .
And I think that the best thing about this is that , for example , Google and Larry .
<unk> , there are two people who care about this world , with their wealth .
If you have the same values , it does n't care about two people in the world .
So it 's going to be that the world is catching up .
It 's important to make a difference .
<unk> : Richard , I 've never seen it before , and I do n't know what to do , but I think it should be <unk> .
You 've got a lot of inspired today today . Look at that , I think he 's going to have a way of doing it .
So , thank you so much for us today , thanks to the TED TED , thank you for TED . Thank you .
Thank you very much .

<unk> sculptures are used to use time , shape , angle , thinking about four or distorted sensations associated with <unk> and <unk> , in the museum of India to show us his magic equipment .

<unk> : <unk> with <unk> art
As I said , I have a lot of reports about the word " school . "
And I went out of the classroom , and when I was at the time , teachers would say , " Hey , come back .
How do you do it ? "
And I would say , " I 'm going to die . Put it . "
And I did n't know why , and one they said , " <unk> , when you say romantic , they 're not satisfied .
So the struggle for that is that you ca n't find your position .
And I remember the night , and I was going to sleep for fun because , for example , I ca n't hear my parents ' parents , because I could n't say another God .
So I said , " No , do n't make a good job , get a chance of helping a little bit of opportunity . "
So for example , I 've got a couple of classes on painting .
And then , when I was 13 years old , started in a <unk> artist named <unk> , and there were <unk> .
And for example , schools started to support me .
" Oh , he 's learned nothing about it , but she 's going to get him to canvas , maybe . "
So I had to live , and I found myself in school .
In one game , I won a little fan of <unk> radio .
And I had a lot of <unk> , and I could n't go home .
And I was on the train , and I got the audio .
If you sit down in India , you know people like to hear the radio , even with the mobile phone .
And then , when I was 13 -- so I heard the radio , and there was a guy sitting next to me , just like the three people sitting here .
That 's me next to me .
And he said , " Well , what do you buy ? How many money ? "
And I said , " That 's all the paintings of play . "
And he said , " Oh , I 've studied painting .
I think you should learn in art schools .
You 're going to jump directly down . "
So , I said , " Well , maybe you 're sitting next to you , probably changing your life . This is possible .
As long as we think enough , we have <unk> .
So , this is to keep my failures for three times , and ultimately it 's going to go into art school to do what I really want to work on .
And when I do n't think about it , what happened to the past decade , in the last decade or 15 years , has been around three themes , but it does n't happen .
And my point of view , because I was thinking , " What made the difference ? " And I <unk> : That 's the past . "
So I thought , when you 've got the last way to understand the past , it 's only to try to figure out what 's going on in the past , because it 's the last time you 've seen it .
It could be a bunch of pieces , and maybe it might be played , or in a <unk> or in a <unk> .
But this is all about time .
And I was deeply fascinated by the way that I was <unk> this art .
So when I move around with the lines , I 'm collecting them , <unk> them .
And now I want to show you some of you .
This is called " self - <unk> . "
It 's a piece of <unk> from the body .
And then the body really really loves this sign , like this statue , from my past .
It 's just a 3D picture .
The components of the show , <unk> elements , are closer to self - awareness .
It 's just like a fossil .
Well , slowly slowly moves , to explore all sorts of things .
So , this is what I 've been talking about , and this experience is very glamorous , because we have the freedom to walk , whether it 's going to be <unk> , but in a moment , you ca n't do it in the moment because it does n't have to move .
This is a shot of <unk> , because , of course , the perception or the absence of what we do , always always .
So I thought , I 'm going to document , <unk> , toes , all the way around us as human beings .
This is a <unk> gesture , this is the sun .
Because when I was caught , I always wondered whether , or a object freely moving , had another object , and was left the other way to capture his face ? "
This piece is -- because the lens of the camera is just showing you what 's going on .
So I put it on the weather , and he 's <unk> , then I 've got the sun portrait .
This is called " <unk> . "
And what I do is , I 'm going to put it on 10 feet and then , you know .
It took 24 hours to run .
So whatever paper was made out of his mouth , he turned out .
Even if we 're trying to understand what they 're looking at , their perception and the environment is the biggest .
So what do we really understand , or we just try to understand him ?
So the question is <unk> , because even if you go to understand , you 're acting in the role of understanding .
Like , for example , a simple behavior .
How many of you saw <unk> <unk> , when you come from Bangalore to ' 80s ?
Okay ?
If you ask a point of view , everyone 's understanding is different .
For example , a teacher says , " Well , she 's going to say , " Go to the other one . "
When it comes to asked , you know .
And if you look at it , the answer is n't different .
And he would say , " It 's going to be much larger . "
And <unk> said , I have a dream , and all the cows get free to travel across the <unk> , without any argument . "
Imagine <unk> now , and then he saw the same cow crossing the <unk> .
And he would say , " <unk> , and he said to the cows , she says , ' <unk> crossing <unk> . " And then the cow enters the <unk> and <unk> it .
Freud would say , you know , facts about what you 're doing .
If we ask Einstein , he would say , " It 's cow crossing , or cow roads , depending on your <unk> . "
So , <unk> . If he saw the same head , he would say , " Please stop your cows . "
So , what we see is that often we think , and most of us do n't see the nature of things .
We just depend on our instinct .
So what 's the point ?
Let 's look at this little little piece .
Because I always think it does n't make any sense .
There is nothing wrong in the world of this world .
It 's only in our head .
If you look at this <unk> , this is the area , it 's a long time .
This is what we learned in school .
But if you take it from the middle , I do n't see this space , but it 's still happening .
So what we 're doing is that we do n't exist ; he 's in the other side , even though we say dark , light , good , bad , terrible , <unk> , things are not there .
And that 's just , as a human being , by training things , we 're making meaning to create meaning .
So this piece of work is like -- well , he 's called " light <unk> " dark .
This is from <unk> .
So <unk> does n't create light , but it creates dark colors .
So this is an attempt to explore the art of this subject .
This is called " <unk> . "
And he shows the astonishing <unk> of our visual auditory -- we really see it ?
This is a terrific portrait .
It 's about six feet long , but it looks like he 's talking about his head .
And the wall is like -- this is <unk> <unk> , second , third , every layer .
We just walked out of the entire wall .
Again , " India . "
It 's based on me .
About eight feet deep .
When I was doing it , always <unk> to cooperate -- and now , when I saw a question -- whenever I see birds in the head , what do they do ?
Is it a way to turn this idea into the art of the visible art ?
I ca n't find it .
But stop thinking about six , seven months later , I thought , well , in a restaurant , when I was changing air , he came from the organ .
It 's called " <unk> . "
This is what I did .
It 's a very interesting process to do , because I 'm writing about the air company , which says , " <unk> <unk> , I am an artist , and this is my entire life .
Can you help me do this ? "
They did n't say to me .
And then I thought , " Well , I 'll go through some <unk> to help help . "
So I told them , " I want to run a air company . "
They said , " Yes . "
" This is the project population report , and you 'll give you details . "
And finally , I went to them and told them that I was n't a company ; I wanted to do my work .
You 'll see me . "
And then they came .
This piece is " <unk> . "
In India , nobody really cares about art . They just care about the price .
Now you bought this for 3,000 <unk> , two months later .
That 's the truth , but there 's a couple of islands , things that might be <unk> .
This is the painting of <unk> -- it turns out they 're not going to have a few money . Because the values will fall .
This is a few weeks later , several months later .
This is just a question about corruption .
So if someone says , " Oh , I 've seen it . " A few months later he would n't be <unk> .
And if they say it 's solid , he might not be solid , he would miss .
If they say they 're going to die , it 's <unk> , because he does it .
It 's in the same <unk> air .
They breathe , and they breathe .
And when I was doing that , I had my mother , and I looked at him and said , " Why are you always stuck around this <unk> theme ? "
And I said , " Excuse me ? "
" <unk> <unk> , " and now <unk> cells ?
Do n't you feel a little bit about death ? They say .
" No , no , for me , I think , " he 's being taken some little solid , but he <unk> the whole whole thing . "
But she said , " No , I 'm not like him .
Are you a <unk> , if you 're an <unk> process ? "
I said , " No , mother , no .
Because we could go to the <unk> to do a sculpture , or we can break the parachute , but we ca n't create the soil . "
So I made this piece for her .
It 's called " <unk> <unk> . "
This is the first time that 's going to be the same thing as food as it is .
So , a few days later , after a few days .
This is 15 or 20 days later .
Despite that little <unk> of glass and the wood of the glass , the air goes down , and then there 's another <unk> .
But he gave me a larger challenge .
And that <unk> sculpture gave me a larger , true faith . Maybe maybe there are more possibilities to capture things unseen .
So what you 're seeing here is called " <unk> <unk> . "
And what I want to tell you is that we do n't see shadow , not seeing light , and what we see is light .
And what we saw was their reflection in their own .
You know , this is why , at night , we see <unk> black , but actually he does n't have light light .
When they cut off the surface , we saw him .
<unk> is the same thing .
The smaller dust will ring light , and then we feel light .
We do n't see the dark matter , and you ca n't see the light , and you ca n't see gravity .
So , I started doing this kind of work to try and figure out what 's going on in space .
Because , in the visual arts , I see this , and then I saw that -- but what about <unk> ?
And if we look at this , he has two statements .
It 's also the surface of this .
And the other side is the outside of the ground .
I 'm going to do this as a experiment , and you know , this epiphany .
This is a <unk> box and his shadow .
The second moment , the moment that you see in this unseen is the nature of all the senses .
So he had a shadow .
And I thought , okay , let me put my customers out .
And then , once again , he becomes an object .
And then third , third .
So now you just look at shadow .
And then again , there was no shadow .
I thought , " Oh , good , done .
You can see the details .
It 's called gravity .
It 's called " <unk> <unk> . "
It 's <unk> , there are about 110 <unk> .
So in fact , that hole has done air .
We can see that he 's happening , but it 's actually never seen anything .
This is from a show from <unk> .
It 's called " <unk> . "
details .
And what I want to tell you is that our senses are so unpredictable , what we do n't see .
We ca n't feel that , " I 'm looking for air , and if you squeeze it fast , I can feel it .
So all we have about the ecology of reality is all through these very glamorous senses .
So <unk> , like , did n't have a method for all of these things as pure symbols ?
And the real purpose is that we need to go beyond the wall , to the other side , <unk> , unseen .
Because we saw someone walking around .
But if we 're just throwing it down , and try to figure it out , it 's going to get out of the way , because actually the journey is just sitting in the <unk> .
Thanks .

<unk> <unk> : The physics that taught me
I 'm doing my favorite job job , but my first commitment is the physics , and this passion is a great teacher to get me a little white .
So he taught me physics that 's cool because it teaches us many things about the world around us .
And I 'm going to spend a few minutes for you to believe that physics can teach us something about marketing .
So very quickly , who 's going to learn a little bit about malaria in university .
Who learned physics in universities ?
Oh , good . Who 's been teaching ?
Okay , many people .
So , I hope it will make us happy , or maybe some kind of <unk> memories .
So , about physics and marketing .
We 're going to start from some simple beginning , and Darwin 's second law : " <unk> the quality of the mass . "
This is something that may be a little bit more than a few more steps , and then they 're going to jump on .
But if we quickly quickly take the formula , we can get <unk> <unk> , which means that the higher quality of a larger <unk> is more <unk> to change the movement direction .
<unk> is also the same thing . The size of the brands , the higher it requires more force to change it .
And that 's why photography is <unk> , and the choice is not trying to persuade the world to the other things that you 're talking about .
And this explains why <unk> found it hard to believe that his company is not only about empty vacuum cleaners , but explained why , like <unk> and <unk> , it 's not going to require a lot of branding , such as <unk> or <unk> .
So the more physics of the physics is that the quality of a object needs more force to change its movement .
The marketing is , the more the brands are <unk> it .
So thinking about a new type of brands or something that might be designed for new <unk> .
Now , who remember <unk> <unk> ?
Now , a little bit of technology .
So what it means is that it 's impossible to measure the state of a particle , like , for example , the location of it , and its <unk> , because the measure is changing this particle .
So to explain it -- if there 's a leopard , you 're going to get a light bulb from it , and then you have <unk> glasses , so you do n't know what it is , so you do n't know what this particle is .
By measuring it by measuring particles , it changes its behavior .
Looking at behavior change it .
The marketing is also .
Use observation , to change what they behave .
Think about a bunch of mothers who are talking about them in a focal group , and almost nobody can buy huge amounts of junk food .
At the time , McDonald 's raised hundreds of wires .
And the people who want to look at the <unk> shops , they 're going to be able to stack their <unk> up into fresh <unk> and fruit , but not like anything else .
If you think about it , it 's not a lot of people who are looking at people in the world , and people do n't have a lot .
Well , we know that Google is looking at the project .
So fortunately , science -- no , excuse me , marketing becomes easier .
And fortunately , now have a better marketing tracking operation , and more digital media consumption , you can do better with consumers , rather than what they 're doing .
So the physics is that you 're never going to be accurate , very precisely , because <unk> will change it .
And the message that marketing is , the information is to try to figure out what consumers are doing , rather than they say they 're going to do what they do .
So , the way that all of science , as well as the physics of physics -- think you ca n't see a hypothesis . You only have this assumption .
That means that you can collect more and more about a <unk> or a hypothesis , and it 's going to <unk> this <unk> , but it does n't end it .
As long as you can see , there 's a little bit of data .
So if we take example -- <unk> has a lot of data to support his theory that the planet can rotate around Earth .
It just takes a strong observation to this idea .
And this is a little bit of a <unk> , and you can invest in a branding for a long time , but it 's going to be <unk> for the truth .
In the case of the U.K. Oil , they spent a few years to spend a lot of <unk> on their own environment , and then a little bit of accidents .
Think about Toyota .
A long time ago , this was a <unk> car , and then they came up with a big <unk> event .
<unk> , in a long period of time , was considered the perfect brands .
Okay , you know his story .
So physics is the physics that you ca n't prove , but it 's easy to <unk> it . Anything that is n't reliable .
<unk> is no longer how much you invest in your brand , and the poor week can be <unk> for decades .
So very carefully , it 's a very careful thing to do , and it can <unk> your <unk> .
And finally , <unk> is more <unk> than <unk> , the second law of <unk> .
And the laws think that entropy is a way of measuring the system , and this is the way that <unk> is increasing .
The marketing is also .
If we look back in 20 years , a marketing manager can be able to make a difference .
But today we are changing .
You can get a powerful <unk> or a message , and then you 're going to show it , as an election in the year earlier .
But then you lose control of it .
Because even though the consumers are able to use digital <unk> design , design design and <unk> tools , you ca n't control it .
Your grandparents started <unk> . <unk> became more glamorous .
It 's a lack of control .
I did see he was speaking . He did .
But they are upset , but it 's a good thing to do .
<unk> energy is allowing you to be more close to your branding , much more knowledgeable people .
The distribution of energy is a force of democracy , and ultimately it will be good for your branding .
So , since the experience of the physics , it 's the entropy of entropy , which is a fundamental law .
And the message that you get from the amygdala is that your brand is increasingly <unk> .
You ca n't negotiate with the truth , and then you can get it to solve it .
So in the face of <unk> , my teacher , the ice , and I told me the physics of physics -- I 've already convinced you that physics can teach us all the people , even as marketing , some things .
Thank you .

Yves <unk> demos the line from <unk>
In South America , the line is <unk> in the history of a hundred hundred years .
And <unk> provides a much more sophisticated relationship with a new material .
A lot of people are in cities like this , which means that the new kind of industrial material that has begun to do is to get out of the natural constraints of that .
Here you see this change that people start using modern materials .
These are the robots from the ' 50s .
In the late 1990s , I was interested in the art of change and passion , and I think it 's a new way of thinking about a kind of a whole type of life .
And I 've got the opportunity to start working with the people who work with this community , <unk> and design , and <unk> them .
This project is taken over a year in the first year .
So very quickly , our demand to be able to use this <unk> is that we have a wire license to help us do it not only with the materials we want to create , but the color of our colors .
And at the same time , I 'd like to create some kind of stuff , rather than ever before .
And so I came up with the product , which was clear , and they were very interested in a much higher <unk> market and could also be used for <unk> .
And then we did a series of experiments , as you can see from the shape and the structure , the size of the scale , and it became a very important project , it was very successful that this project was about 12 years , so we made the goods for <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> .
This is our central <unk> team .
They 've come every week .
It 's all about <unk> .
They went back to the first village area .
One week , a week .
This is the community I showed you .
It 's already been present today to support 300 remix jobs .
This is what I want to say .
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> : A plea for <unk>
And since this is the <unk> Conference , what 's the French <unk> ?
I think you should have <unk> history . French <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Spanish is " Frost . "
<unk> is " <unk> . "
This is <unk> <unk> , or <unk> .
These are different types of <unk> or different type of wood .
There 's only two <unk> of <unk> using this instrument , using a hole to control the <unk> , to play a song and dance with the violin .
There are three different types of <unk> .
One is that the first is <unk> <unk> , and it 's the equivalent of <unk> .
And the second is <unk> channel , and it 's linked to <unk> boxes like the Republican <unk> box .
The third is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is the only instrument of using this technology .
It <unk> the <unk> or the " <unk> . "
When I rotate the <unk> <unk> , it 's going to make a sound like <unk> sound ?
These are the parts of the body . It 's about the instrument of stone instruments , and there 's a lot of players who are going to play the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> hole , the other one to <unk> the string , the other one .
And then a few centuries later , <unk> has changed .
So a person can play the <unk> , and of course , one of the things that people do n't know is that it 's a very heavy thing to do .
From the angle of <unk> , <unk> is <unk> with dance , and this is because of the <unk> of a whole range of filaments , of course , to use it .
In this case , <unk> <unk> is used to be used for various sorts of music , like <unk> Music , dance , modern music and <unk> , but it 's already <unk> .
An <unk> needs a <unk> .
Three five - five years of <unk> can be made in Europe , in Europe .
And Yves <unk> is very crucial .
Not bad . Are you going to hear ?
<unk> : I ca n't hear , you do n't want to hear it .
<unk> : Okay .
There we go .
I want to use <unk> because it 's where I live , and that 's a landmark between the French and Spain .

This is a <unk> <unk> I did with traditional <unk> .

Helen <unk> on love and kindness
I 'm going to talk to you about the big trend of <unk> , which is probably about 10 years of consciousness .
But I want to tell you first from my research research because this is my latest job .
My colleagues and my colleagues , the <unk> of the 32 , had a functional brain scan .
The 17 people who have taken 18 percent of those people get to the other 15 people , just <unk> .
So I want to start with this experiment , and I 'm going to tell you about the experience of love .
<unk> said , " What is love ? "
And I think that our ancestors are about a million years from this problem , and they look at the stars , or they look at stars .
And in order to find <unk> , I 've learned that 45 years of psychology in psychology , when people fall into love .
The first thing that 's going to happen is the other person 's beginning to get it . "
And as a <unk> once said to me , my world has a new center , which is <unk> paint .
And <unk> describes the same thing in different ways .
He said that romantic love is a difference between women and other women .
And that 's true .
And then you put all the attention on this person .
But you can also do that , though you do n't like , but she does n't have to love her , she 's not going to love her .
As <unk> said , " love is <unk> . "
To understand the poetry I decided to read from the world now , I would read a little <unk> <unk> in China , because it 's perfectly glamorous to show a man about how to get a woman 's attention .
As a person who looks like a crazy love of love , this person goes into the parking room , and he thinks it 's all different .
This man has the red <unk> , which is different than anything else .
In this story , a man obsessed with a <unk> .
This <unk> is written by poet 's poet : <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
Yves <unk> on <unk> , <unk>
And the reason for that is that , in fact , what you 're going to do with you , because the dopamine rate of dopamine is increasing .
But nonetheless , it 's not about this person to have a special meaning for you or her .
You 're very tired of him , and you 're extremely aggressive .
It 's like a railway station : " I feel like flying air . "
You 're never going to wake up in front of you . You 're going to get all the time .
When things go better , you feel that when you 're not good at it , then you fall into extreme <unk> and <unk> .
You depend on this person .
As a lawyer in New York , I said , " Everything like anything she likes to say " like , " I love . "
<unk> , love is simple .
Yves <unk> has <unk> <unk> .
You know , if you 're just deaf and a person , you do n't care about him or somebody who cares if you 're not .
But when you get into love , you have <unk> <unk> .
And I think that this phenomenon is changing the evolution of evolution .
Because the love of love is to put two people together , and it 's very strong to make two people .
But the most important feature for love is to desire to be part of a person , not just with a <unk> .
And of course , <unk> is good , but you 're more willing to call him , she 's going to phone you , and you 'll go out and tell you that he loves you .
One of the main characteristics of love is motivation .
You 've got to start doing this . You want this person .
And the last thing that 's really important is the same strategy of love .
When I get them into the <unk> airport , I ask them all sorts of questions .
But the most important problem is that it 's an important problem .
" How many times do you have in this day ? "
And they said , " Well , I 've never been stopped . "
And then I would ask them the last question , and I 'm always going to <unk> them to answer this question because I do n't have a psychologist .
I could n't cure people of their heart .
And the final question happened .
" Are you going to die for this person ? "
And these people say , " Yes . "
It 's like I asked them to send me a <unk> .
I was shocked .
And I 'm going to show them a photo of love , and then let them show you a little photo , <unk> their brain .
We 'll find that the same brain is going to be the most powerful <unk> in the moment when you 're waiting .
We also found that a lot of brains are active .
And in fact , one of the brain regions that we care about is this brain region that makes you feel like a brain region .
And that 's what people saw when people saw love .
And I started realizing that <unk> is not just an emotion .
I used to think that love is a series of emotions coming from very intense , very weak .
But in fact , romantic love is a drive , it comes from the power of <unk> , and it 's a very strong desire for us .
And this power , as you want to get out of the piece of chocolate , like you get to work in the workplace .
It 's driving our brain , and it 's our drive .
And I think this power force is more powerful .
And when you ask people whether you want to meet you , if this person says , " No , you do n't have to say that because of the suicide epidemic or depression .
But in the world , people are being rejected by love , and they 're going to be <unk> .
People die for love , <unk> , dead love .
They made songs for love , poetry , novel , sculptures , paintings and paintings .
In addition to over 43 societies , they proved that part of the brain is so powerful .
<unk> people , so I think it 's the most powerful brain organization in the world .
And I think that it 's from the first three different different brain of <unk> and <unk> development .
One of them is compassion : one of the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is called " <unk> de <unk> . "
It 's always renewing you , like hunger .
The second is romantic romantic love : <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
And that third is to depend on the silence and the safety of a long <unk> .
And I think that 's what <unk> desire to get you out of the population .
You know , you can feel it .
It will <unk> people .
And <unk> will make you focus on a relationship , so you 're going to get your energy energy , waiting to wait .
And the third brain system : it depends on the development of <unk> , and you can do it for him , at least to help you raise your kids .
And then I 'm going to talk about two most significant social trends .
One of the things that came up with 10,000 years ago is 25 years old , and these two trends are <unk> , love with these three different kinds of brains .
The first observation is that women start to work , become part of labor .
It 's about 28 countries in the United Nations , <unk> countries .
There 's a couple of hundred countries in the midst of 130 countries who are going to go into the workforce , and it might be slowly slower , but this trend is the distance between men and women , health .
That process is very slowly .
And all of the trends on Earth are always doing a kind of resistance .
And we all know that , but as old as the old Arab expression says , " <unk> , it still persists . "
In fact , the trend is <unk> .
Women are entering the workforce .
I mean , I 'm going to go back , because women care are not new .
Over the years of Africa , women are going to collect vegetables every day to farm vegetables .
They went back to 60 or 80 .
The family population is the standard family .
And also , women also have the same economic abilities , social skills and options .
<unk> , we 're <unk> .
And yet , the ideal innovation of women is <unk> .
And as the beginning of the <unk> civilization , the role of women is <unk> <unk> .
Women lost it as the original job of the <unk> , but as women in the Industrial Revolution , women started to go back to the workforce .
<unk> , they 've got the social social status of a million years ago , and even tens of thousands of years earlier , even 100 years ago .
We 're seeing one of the most iconic traditions of human history now .
And this tradition is creating influence .
And usually , my whole talk can be on the influence of women .
And I 'm going to tell you a little bit about it , and I 'm going to talk about it .
There 's a lot of variation between men and women who think people are similar to women , people who are very similar , not at the same time .
I do n't know why they think men and women are same .
Men and women have a lot of places , but there are many different places .
As Doug Engelbart 's name , " We 're like two feet of people , needs to move forward . "
But our brains are not the same structures .
And now you 're finding more <unk> differences .
I just told you one number of times , and I 'm going to go into the <unk> and love of love and love .
One of them is the language of women . Women are talking about <unk> .
Women can get the right to find the correct <unk> , which is clear that this ability to reach in the middle of the city .
But even in the early days , their performance is much better than the average men .
Women talk about women .
And they did that in a million years ago , and language was their tools .
They face educational education kids , kids who use language , they teach kids to educate kids .
But women are becoming a powerful force .
Even in some women , the countries of the <unk> market , like India , and Japanese women go into news industries .
I think television is like a global <unk> .
We 're around it , and it 's also affecting our mind .
When I recorded my show , I call the license of the conversation , almost almost women .
In fact , <unk> once said , " You have a great writer , like a government .
Today , writers in the U.S.
This is just one of the characteristics that women have to bring into the workforce where they get into the workforce .
Women have a special social skills and skills .
They have a wealthy vision .
<unk> and <unk> , the brain of the ages , the brain form .
They think they 're thinking about <unk> .
Because there 's a better part of the brain , when they think about it , they 're able to collect more data , more complex forms , and see more choices and outcomes .
They can do the same , the entire thinking , called the Internet <unk> .
And the men will claim that they 're not going to accept what they are doing , and thinking about what 's going on .
These two ideas are great .
We need them .
In fact , in this world , men are <unk> or <unk> .
But the world 's <unk> is male .
When the men are doing good , you can get very good .
And I think that we 're trying to build a cooperative social society where men and women are able to engage the social and <unk> of the women .
In fact , women are in the workforce , and there are huge effects associated with family markets , love and family .
And obviously , women start acting their desires .
And I 'm always surprised when people ask me , " Why are men always so damn that ? "
And I said , " How do you assume it 's male than men ? "
" Yeah , men are <unk> . "
And I asked them , " Well , what are these men with people ? "
And the result is that .
Anyway , anyway .
In the West , they have more <unk> , and they 're not going to get married because of their own " <unk> " and the children who are married to look at better marriages for good marriages .
Women have more <unk> expression and <unk> .
Indeed , we 're going to go back to the <unk> of a hundred years ago , in Africa , because this is the social expression of <unk> and conservatives .
We 're struggling with the <unk> of <unk> .
There is a quote that the marriage of the 21st century can be called " marriage , " which means " <unk> marriage . "
<unk> - <unk> marriage came back to the form of <unk> and human spirit .
We also see people who are <unk> .
The women in the United States and the men who do n't look at the quality of each other , and she 's married to all the quality of each other , and if he does n't get each other .
In 37 countries research , people are only married to people who love their love .
Indeed , <unk> already started the stage .
I think marriage should be more stable because we 're facing the second big trend .
The first is that women go into the workforce , and the second one is the second one .
In the United States , it 's been called the ' 80s .
Because , in the nine - year - old , 40 percent of the people who live in this room are not any problem .
So , we saw the progress extension teams .
There 's a couple of hundred countries in my own book that I have .
And you can see that when age older , collision is as fast as possible .
So now the deficit in the United States is accelerating , actually .
The future will continue .
And as " <unk> , " as a result , <unk> is a little bit more glamorous , and it 's a lot of <unk> women who have never seen so much like this now .
There are no kinds of women who are so strong like today , <unk> and <unk> .
So I 'm very sure that , in the most part of the history of human evolution , the experience for <unk> is now , right now !
But there 's also a lot of complex problems .
In these three brains , <unk> , purity , and dependent on it is n't always connected together .
By the way , they can also exist .
That 's why silenced is n't so glamorous .
When you arrived , your body released dopamine .
The dopamine is connected to the <unk> , and you 're love to love that , " <unk> . "
And in the same time , the body is still forming " <unk> " and " the frontal lobe " " which is " dependent on <unk> .
This is why you relate to other people , you feel that you 're connected to her relationship with her .
But these three emotions are n't always tied together .
You 've got a <unk> for a long period of time and responsibility , and you 're equally passionate about the other person , but you might have a third person .
<unk> , we can love lots of people .
In fact , when we 're lying on the bed , we can think of somebody who 's going to feel to someone else .
In your mind , you have a <unk> because you need a choice .
So I think that humans are n't created the species of happiness , and we 're a species that is created by <unk> .
And I think happiness is our discovery .
We can build good relationships for each person .
So I want to conclude with two things .
One of the things that made me worry about , I have a worried , a nice story .
My fear is about pepper medicine .
This is a year in the U.S.
These drugs are pervasive .
They 're against the world .
And I learned that a girl came from 13 years old , and she was taking a baby medication for <unk> drugs .
She 's 23 years old , and she started to take this drug from 13 .
And I 'm not anti - <unk> , because it 's a very scary thing to do .
For people who want suicide or <unk> .
I 'm a suggestion .
But increasingly , more American people have started fighting depression .
The effect of these drugs is to improve quality quality .
And as <unk> moves , <unk> is increasing .
Everybody knows everybody .
<unk> is connected to <unk> .
<unk> spray is not glamorous , but it keeps <unk> .
When you have sex , you 're going to lose .
Once you lose the <unk> , it 's made of your <unk> hormone .
And the nervous system is connected to each other .
One of the brain systems is <unk> , and another system is going to fail .
I just want to say a world without love .
So , thank you .
I want to end with a story , and then it 's a <unk> .
And I have a research in love , <unk> and <unk> .
I was twins , and I 'm so thrilled about that .
Why do you like to say that you 're like , why <unk> , Japanese people are Australia , and people like <unk> are so similar as well .
About a year ago , a network is <unk> <unk> , and <unk> found me to design a new flag for them .
And I said , " I do n't know about the character , you know ? "
And I do n't know if you 've found that .
And they said , " Yes . "
And that makes me think , why you love a person rather than another person .
This is the project that I 'm working on right now , which is my book .
You have a lot of fun .
<unk> is important , and it 's important .
<unk> matters . You might be a mysterious person , and love him , because <unk> can get your head rises to your brain .
You love those same <unk> that you 're like , " <unk> Map , you know , <unk> the <unk> list .
And I think that you 're going to be attracted to people who are <unk> with you .
This is what I 'm trying to study now .
But I want to tell you a story about this .
I 'm here to talk about the laws of love .
I want to tell you something about the magic of romantic love .
This is a story that sounds like a real story .
It 's about a graduate student , and I 'm <unk> , my two colleagues , <unk> <unk> .
That 's where we 're doing the same thing for people .
And it 's a graduate student , a student - old love , but the girl does n't love him .
And then they went to a <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And he learned that , in our work , if you 're doing something very 3D , you can move the amount of dopamine in the brain , and it 's probably <unk> <unk> .
So he decided to use the science to work , so he sat around with a girl .
I 've never done a lot of crazy things about the car and trucks between the bus and the trucks .
And she thinks that it 's going to increase the distribution of girl 's brain , so she 's going to get girls and girls .
It 's a girl who 's excited about it , and it 's the best time that the girl likes to enjoy her love .
And after one hour , they did the same girl on her hands , and she said , " It 's too fascinating . "
" That <unk> <unk> . "
This is the magic of love .
And after the end , I 'm going to say , in a hundred years , humans have developed three brains of <unk> , love and love for long ages .
These <unk> are deeply embedded in human brains .
They 're going to do this with human beings , " <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
<unk>
Bill Ford lives with car - <unk> -- his great great job is <unk> Ford . He 's grown up in large <unk> . So , he 's concerned about the influence of the environment and the global problems , and in the world , it 's going to be more powerful than the future , or more green and more open , <unk> , even cooler .
cars , design , innovation , technology
<unk>
Bill Ford : <unk> tomorrow .
And I was born with the <unk> of the car and the automotive , and I 've been working on the past 30 years of my work .
And what I was concerned about was how to sell more cars .
And what I 'm worried about today is that if we 're trying to sell more cars .
What percentage of the number of cars that are going to be in the road , and you have twice the consequences , and even three times ?
There are two things that I love in my lifetime .
I actually grew up in <unk> .
The younger age of the ages is to return to the <unk> Ford or <unk> , and I think it 's really cool at the road .
When I was 10 years old , I decided that if I could make a test crash , it would be good .
When my parents came to dinner .
When they sit down , I 'm <unk> .
And <unk> , you know , <unk> the liver , and it 's very , very <unk> .
Two years later , two years after -- I was about 12 years old -- my dad brought him home .
That day was <unk> .
And so he 's going to eat dinner with her mother , and I 'm thrown out of a couple of times , I think there 's a couple of pieces of statements coming out of a couple of times , right ?
My dad was <unk> for dinner .
And he goes down to the Grand Canyon , and my car hits the ice ice cream and hit a ice boat , which is almost halfway around the <unk> .
This is a experience that makes me tick .
But let me start with car .
And my first car was the <unk> of the EPA .
And even though the color is really ugly , I 'm really passionate about it , and it 's really <unk> for my <unk> to my car .
The car is not just something that I love , and I 'm born with them .
My great great job is that the <unk> Ford is in my mom , and my mother is <unk> .
I was born on my head .
And my great great <unk> of <unk> , Bob Ford , is <unk> for people 's lives , which makes people happy .
And he believes that there are forces and progress .
That 's what I believe .
And I love the <unk> of the environment .
I went to <unk> in the northern hemisphere , where I was in <unk> , fishing , and he wrote in the book .
And over a few years , it 's been shocked to me , and I 'm going to go through my favorite walking walk across the shores of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which is now becoming a <unk> or an army of ice or the Alps .
And so even when I was born at the same time , I had a lot of <unk> <unk> , which was in my heart .
And after high school , I started reading books , <unk> <unk> and Yves <unk> , and I had a deeper appreciation of nature .
I never think I 've never seen my love for cars and trucks .
I do n't think until I was college .
In <unk> , you can imagine that my surprise teaches the question that the United States is going to say that it 's all <unk> and our family responsibility .
And they think that we 're focused on the entire industry , whether it 's the whole sector , and not progress , not progress , that we 're <unk> the sky .
And after that , I went into the <unk> , and I did n't have a lot of fun for it .
And I decided to go into the company and look at whether to change change .
Think about it 30 years ago , and I think this is a bit naive , but I have this ritual .
I also found that professors are wrong .
In fact , I went back to <unk> , and I found that my company and other industries were n't born with my environment and I was n't welcome .
You can imagine that I 've got some very interesting conversations .
Some of those people think that these seals should be <unk> me , and I should stop <unk> and <unk> .
I was considered a <unk> .
And I 've never seen that day , I was asked to stop in the workforce , and I would never stop trying to stop and <unk> .
And of course , I do n't accept that I 'm struggling , and this is what we 're talking about today .
Now , my point of view is something that comes from a lot of <unk> .
I mean , I think most people understand that we have to do something .
The good news is that we 're trying to solve the big problems about cars and environmental problems -- not just Ford , all sorts of industries .
We 're going to be 90 percent of the time .
In using technology , we 're getting rid of -- I believe , someday , it can kill -- CO2 emissions .
We started selling <unk> , which was very good .
At the same time , developing <unk> <unk> all the car , and the social resources come from the economy , social , social .
In fact , despite my job , I can still see two successful businesses -- the car and the environmental , the <unk> of the environment -- the day .
Unfortunately , even though we 're dealing with this big problem -- as I say , we have a long way to go , but I can see that we are going to get to the other big problems , and even if you 're trying to do it .
And so I 'm very proud of the research that 's going to be the beginning of the <unk> of the world , as the environment can be .
This problem , using the easiest way of writing is a mathematical problem .
The population of the world today has a number of billion people in our lifetime , and the numbers will go into 90 billion .
In this kind of population level , we 're facing the limits of the planet .
People growing up will cause a lot of problems , and one of the problems is that the transit is unable to bring population to population .
If we look at the population of population and cars , it becomes <unk> .
There 's now about eight billion cars around the world right now .
The more global population goes up to the <unk> of the century , and it 's going to increase the number of <unk> to 20 billion cars .
This will be the big global transportation fleet .
Imagine what affected our everyday lives .
Now , the average American population has been spent about 18 days per year , and it 's wasting a lot of time and resources .
This is not the only country that 's developed more than that .
In <unk> , every driver spends about five hours per day .
And last summer -- many of you can already see this news -- China has a job for 11 miles of transportation .
Over the next decades , 75 percent of the population of population population will live in cities , 50 billion urban population .
You can see how big we are .
If you think about the population , it 's hard to see , we have the pattern of moving patterns in the future .
And obviously , four percent of the time driving is still about four cars in the road , and there 's no budget for the Scientific Revolution .
What if we do n't make change tomorrow ?
And I think you 've probably done it already .
It 's a symptom of an symptoms that 's really unsatisfactory that the challenge is <unk> .
And the bigger question is that the world 's global economy will kill us from the ability to deliver food services , especially in the cities of the city , particularly in cities .
Our quality of life will be <unk> .
What 's the solution ?
And the answer may be .
At the beginning of the <unk> , I had the great music once said , " If I ask people what they want , they would say , well , we want to run faster , much more . "
And when the United States started <unk> , we did n't have a lot more <unk> , but it was <unk> .
In World War II , for example , we do n't build a handle on the ground , but to make meadows air systems .
And now we need to <unk> the same kind of <unk> to create a future .
We need to create smart cars , and we 're also going to build smart roads , smart spaces , wisdom , etc .
We do n't want to waste our time on the <unk> , and we 're going to be looking at the space .
We need a system that 's going to work in real time trying to optimize the range of the population , and to keep the runaway side of the brain , ensure that it does n't have to be <unk> .
Well , obviously , this system is able to ensure that the <unk> of the future can be more sustainable .
And what 's really happy is that this job is already happening in different places .
Yves <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> can communicate with each other in the streets of the city .
And in the ground , it 's a series of <unk> .
In New York , the <unk> Street <unk> is going to be a <unk> , and it 's a very nice car - y operation .
And <unk> and <unk> are going to be building all the time , and it 's all about 20 times per hour in the next 18 minutes .
You see <unk> , they have an interesting system called " <unk> . "
This system is going to take all of the <unk> to a remote control system .
So , the parking is all the way , <unk> , buses , trains .
Now <unk> service is all over the world , I think , well , these are very good .
They <unk> , of course , help save some fuel vessels .
These are great ideas that can cause our progress .
And what really inspired me is what we 're talking about .
So very quickly , we 're using music to use music , entertainment and GPS , that will be used to build a smart car network .
I drove 30 miles per morning in my <unk> , and I went to the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
And I went home , and I was always being overwhelmed by <unk> .
And I always have to leave the other way to go back to the other .
But very quickly , we can see the day of the car communication .
And if I came up in front of my car in Palo Alto , it would immediately immediately get me out of the car , so I would find the best path to go home .
These systems are getting <unk> tests , and they 're going to get out of the way .
The potential of cars connected to the Internet is almost limited .
If you think about the future , you 're going to be <unk> in the downtown , and your car will get a smarter parking system .
And then you go on the car , where you 're going to get a space for you , and you do n't have to go to the parking room , looking at the city , who are the ones who have the cities and the Arctic 's <unk> <unk> .
Or think about a smart telephone in New York City , and you do n't have to get a smarter <unk> in the city .
Or imagine what you 're going to do in the future of tomorrow , and your car will raise your best home to bring you to the rest of the path , where you can get into the next destination .
So this technology is able to bring millions of these <unk> to a remote system .
Obviously , we 've got a problem of dealing with this big problem .
But it 's not a problem when we 're dealing with CO2 emissions and fuel problems .
The solution is n't using much larger cars , building more roads , or new <unk> systems , and the critical question is , I think it 's a global network .
And I know that we can develop this kind of technique that makes it real , and we 're willing to go looking for solutions -- whether it 's <unk> or <unk> , or whatever we do n't think of the future , our entire transportation system needs to serve for our future .
We need the best and smart members of this problem .
Companies , entrepreneurs , risk <unk> , they have to understand that this is a huge opportunity , and also a big social problem .
And as these people who receive the green energy challenges -- I feel very surprised to see so many <unk> , money and serious ideas in the last three years .
We need to use the same passion to the world .
We need to think of people like people in the audience .
Obviously , I need all of you to think about how you can solve this huge problem .
We need all sorts of people that are not just investors , but we need to think about how they 're going to try to figure out how to react to this challenge .
This is a problem that does n't make a difference or a individuality .
This need a <unk> energy policy every country , because every state of the state is going to be <unk> , and it 's a different amount of <unk> and <unk> .
But we need to do something .
We need to design a block of infrastructure to support this organ .
You know , we 've got a long journey .
Since the founder of Sylvia <unk> , most people do n't have to go to the length of over 25 miles away .
We 've got a lot of money in the car , where we have the freedom to work , what we want to do .
We do n't want to stop , we lose the freedom .
We 're thinking about trying to figure out -- I know what we 're going to see -- the big problem about the world is that the size of the environmental problem is the environment , and I think we have to do it to help help fix global problems .
Because that 's because we 're able to ensure that we can start to engage the freedom that we 're free to make .
If we solve this problem , it 's obvious that this can improve our lives .
Because , if you can see it like a zero meter , it 's the world 's freedom to do in the country , and we do n't care today about what 's going on tomorrow .
I believe we 're doing the best of trying to face the most important problems .
This is a serious problem .
Let 's do something .
Thank you .

By showing a series of interesting products , non - <unk> , British brands and the design of Paul Berners - Mann describes the idea of design .
arts , business , design , engineering entertainment , product design
43
Paul <unk> : The detail is design .
Hello . In fact , this is the " <unk> of <unk> " " Hello <unk> . "
And one of the things that 's going to be realized is that the amount of information , which is the " big " requires -- " The Great " " Better " and " <unk> , " state , the state -- and the <unk> .
And how to do that .
I think , Yesterday , Charlie <unk> is very clear about how necessary it is to bring consumers to the process .
And that 's what I want to talk about today .
So , through <unk> , I think it 's our faith -- my faith , and some sort of stuff that we 're working on in our work .
In particular , for example , I 'm called it -- I call this " <unk> . "
It 's always a good idea , and you ca n't see , I think , a lot of times , what we 're doing is just to take the mirrors , say , " Hey , you 're going to see what 's going on .
Not <unk> , I 'll give you one example .
This is a huge medical institution that <unk> us to describe the experience of their patients .
So what I want to do is they expect -- they have a lot of <unk> companies -- I think they 're interested in the <unk> , hundreds of thousands of bubbles , and that system , what the system is .
Or even worse , the <unk> <unk> are full of photos , all sorts of things .
And in fact , the first thing we did is we share this .
I 'm going to show you your <unk> <unk> .
This is the area of the film .
This is 100 seconds .
Three seconds .
<unk> is happening . It 's probably going to happen .
Five seconds .
Five seconds .
Six seconds .
We put the video video videos and they ask them , what is this ?
The point is , when you 're lying in the hospital , what you can do is to look at ceiling , and it 's really bad .
You need to put yourself in the patient . This is <unk> , we 're in <unk> .
And he 's lying on the streets of the hospital looking at the ceiling of a box .
That 's what it feels like .
And they 're a little bit <unk> .
My God , from <unk> 's point of view -- rather than from traditional organization , is very encouraging to them .
That 's the difference for them .
So they 're very fast .
And they say , okay , that 's not a connection .
It 's not a big project to do .
It can make a huge difference .
And so we came up with some little detail from them where they were able to make a huge amount of impact .
First of all , we 've got a little bike after it put it in the hospital , and it 's like when you 're being nurse or doctor , you can talk to them .
You can see them in your eye , and they create a small human interaction .
This is one of the little culprits they do .
What 's interesting about the nurse , who 's doing a job -- well , what can we do with this idea ?
The first thing they did was <unk> the ceiling .
And I think it 's really ... I 've seen this recently .
Now , <unk> is now thinking about what I 'm doing .
This is the way I have a living approach , like <unk> , <unk> .
These are not the best designed for the designers in the world , but anyway , it 's a great <unk> of humanity .
And what they 're doing is , in doing things -- for example , <unk> on the floor , to show you , " This is my room . That 's a very interesting thing .
So you go from the public area .
Another idea , from a nurse -- I love this idea -- they put traditional firms in the middle of the town , and they put them on the wall .
And so you can walk into the room and deliver it to your room .
That 's what it is , little <unk> , a little bit of <unk> .
I think that 's a very , very good example .
It 's not a new idea , it 's more like , you know , something that comes from something from the outside , and then they turn them into a solution .
The history of innovation depends on this .
And I have to read it , because I 'm going to read it .
<unk> <unk> saw her daughter -- <unk> , looking at the display , waiting to look at it and see the TV .
<unk> <unk> is moved from one country to another country , and he 's thinking about why these are the ones that make a box .
So he invented <unk> .
George Turner -- this is n't the <unk> of the shoe of <unk> <unk> -- with his dog , and found a pencil and a dog -- and they 've got a little bit of a <unk> .
And finally , people in England , <unk> <unk> -- this is a big invention in Britain -- a day in his car , looking at the side of the road , saw the <unk> eye .
This is an example of <unk> -- with your eyes , to see things in new ways , and it creates new possibilities for them .
Secondly , unseen , this is <unk> : " In the ' 80s , " and it 's a good new thing to see . "
<unk> solutions .
So , <unk> and <unk> will find more <unk> .
There 's another example of this medicine .
A device maker asked us -- we 've done a <unk> brain and a series of <unk> .
In <unk> we created a lot of technology -- they saw this , and they also need a new technology about health diagnosis .
This is a little nurse in the hospital to do a spinal cord in hospitals .
It needs a little nurse typing .
They expect to see the nurse as a nurse , and it 's incredible that this is incredible .
When we look at the processes , I 'm going to explain why -- obviously , there are some people who are there , and they 're not aware of it .
And when you have your spinal cord <unk> a four - meter long , it 's a device that you can see in this process -- in the process of pain . You 're very upset -- you 're afraid .
So almost every nurse is going to hit the patient 's toes , and they 're doing the same thing -- and it 's going to be able to put it into something completely impossible .
From that , we did n't have a lot of <unk> , but we 're more human and useful .
But anyway , it does n't make a fuss about a <unk> , so you can <unk> .
And back to our theme -- it 's just because of the <unk> of small hands .
I think this is very important .
It 's based on the idea of <unk> .
And we said , " based on the locals , it 's like looking at our bodies . When I get to one one , I start to look at TED , and everything .
It 's a solution to all sorts of problems -- and the normal values that we 're doing , which is the unconscious , but a lot of potential -- that 's what we are looking for .
And we 've recently launched a book that might have seen this , called " <unk> behavior . "
These are what people do , but they have a huge potential and opportunity .
Why are we always walking upright ?
This is a picture of a Japanese road in Japan .
And people are always obeying things , and they do n't know why .
Why do people always put up the squares on the garage ceiling ?
That 's because we 're a little bit -- we have to do it .
Not bad , but it does .
Why do we always put sugar on the <unk> in <unk> ?
We just use the world to create our design .
We usually tell the customer : " You should notice this .
This is important , very important . "
This is how people design their experience .
You learn a lot from it .
And we assumed that if you had a leopard , they could stop it , so we would stop there .
It 's a license .
We use systems to deal with complex things .
We 've got some experience -- from one move to another .
And one of my favorite words said , my mother told me : " Your sister crossing the <unk> , but you do n't need to jump together . "
But we 're all going to get out of the way . We 've always done other people .
Somebody 's trying to explain why : because people do something that they can do .
Many people have similar ideas .
I mean , plastic is like a parking lot of ice cream .
People understand these signals .
We communicate with these <unk> , even unaware of what we 're doing .
And the third one is about " Inconvenient , " or " Nope . "
I often talk about all sorts of differences .
Like the idea of <unk> ideas , all of your knowledge , experience , re - rethink one thing .
I have a friend of art in <unk> , and a day , his boss asked him to design a piece of furniture .
This is one of the most <unk> products of <unk> -- the best selling product in the house .
It 's going to wake up with the shoes , and if I do it , because it 's hard to connect .
But still , how do you <unk> this copy for kids ?
If you look at the movement of kids , you find that kids do n't want to fold things up .
Children have a completely different idea of adults .
They 're standing in the object , or they fall down .
Even around the <unk> , they understand the understanding of the space and the way it thinks about space .
So , first you have to -- this is CNN , that designer -- putting yourself in the way of the kids , so he 's going to take the table .
What happens to the result ?
This is the tool that he designed .
What is this ? I hear you ask . No , I do n't hear .
That 's what I think is a particularly cute design .
This is an approach to a new solution .
This is a solution to an emotional solution -- and , of course , it 's probably impossible .
But this is n't the light that <unk> its challenge , and I think it 's very glamorous .
And to think about it , in the TED conference , I heard the idea of how to put it in other people 's minds , to stand up with the feeling that they feel .
And that 's how to deal with the problem .
And I think that 's the main thing .
The last chapter : <unk> <unk> . We all have .
Talk about this .
That means that from thinking , from <unk> .
And this is one of the themes that I heard over here , and I 've just heard about it . How do we start ? How can we begin ?
One day , a company in Kenya commissioned us to design a pump .
Now this company is <unk> .
And as designers , we want to make the product very beautiful , spend a lot of time to think about shape .
That does n't work .
When you 're standing in those people 's shoes , you 'll find that this product will be folded , and you can put it on the bicycle , which is much more important than the lens .
This need to look at a point from a user perspective .
We have to bring ourselves into the world .
This kind of <unk> product is really practical .
And it does n't work like a railway station .
Kids can use it , adults , people can do it .
And it changed these people -- another theme -- <unk> them to entrepreneurs .
These are very easy to use this pump .
For us , we also have a lot of <unk> .
Eventually , we 've got the needs of our clients , the demand for different people in the company , to make them very happy about what we 're designing with the product of the product .
This is that pump , for 30 feet of water .
In the morning , we put these <unk> on each one of us .
Our name is to give you the names of <unk> , not the other , but another project .
Because this symbol is in our lives .
And this is really important .
So we put this <unk> . "
I hope you 're wearing it .
My talk is that , thank you very much .
<unk>
And <unk> <unk> is going to show you one of the most profound meaning in the Indian Republic of elementary school schools : " The most important lessons for kids : <unk> . "
children , education , leadership , social change , society
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : Let 's learn a child about liberal arts
<unk> is a <unk> .
Even today , I love this word today .
<unk> , passion is <unk> .
The inspiration is <unk> .
We 've heard a few brilliant stories about what they 're talking about .
But the same thing , I think , is affected by what they 're called " <unk> , " which I call the " germs . "
So the question is , why can they be transmitted ?
Why do n't you see why it 's about 10 million people ?
Is it honor and opportunity ?
Can you have plans to think about it , <unk> ?
Well , in the next eight minutes , I want to share with you the story of <unk> .
When I had only 17 years old , I was struck by <unk> , as a student in design , and I worked with the big people who were working on the idea of <unk> -- and they were really concerned about my idea and discussing and discussed .
And I 'm very proud of it , and it 's so amazing that it 's <unk> .
I hope that I was in seven years old , and it was called " <unk> . "
So , 10 years ago , when I came to school , I started teaching my education trial , and I created a process of design and design an approach to people , " I <unk> . "
And I do that ! That 's what happens if you can bring learning to the reality of the world , and then children are going to experience a process of understanding things in this process , where they 're able to see how change changes , to change the change , changing change and change change .
And you can grow happiness directly .
And kids are more competitive than they are .
And these are all <unk> , almost everybody knows .
So , I 'm going to show you how we do this in <unk> .
<unk> : We 're going to talk about the background of our fifth year - old curriculum , where they 're asked to make the <unk> of <unk> , and they 've been asked by eight hours to work with the <unk> of <unk> .
The image of the image is , you 'll see their experience and their next day , and they 're deeply concerned about the experience associated with this experience to change the world .
♫ Everyone 's going to talk ♫ ♫ They 're doing <unk> .
Two hours later , they 're starting to make them change .
Once they feel , once they get changed , they have changed every single person in the city .
<unk> , his face , because he knows , he changed his adult idea .
This is absolutely impossible to see in classrooms .
So , when <unk> happens , he 's teaching me from " The teacher , " which is " I 'm going to think of it .
This is a process that can be <unk> and nurturing .
But there 's also parents concerned , " Okay , we 're going to be very good at this . " But the math , the science , what do you do ? "
Just look at me . "
We see him . Really data .
When kids are trusted and empowering the power of one thing to do , whether they 're not good at doing it , they do n't work very well , and actually , it 's a very , very nice , <unk> - to - school relationship that 's going to look at the <unk> of <unk> , which is in the first 10 years , in terms of the math , the Japanese and scientific sciences .
So , this way is very effective .
So , in August of 2007 , 15 percent of the day , the child came out to the campus , " <unk> <unk> . "
Now , this is n't the case of <unk> schools .
This is a relationship with all the kids , so we 're no longer <unk> .
Went into the hall of the city , walked down to the police police , and walked into all sorts of companies , where we said , " When are you going to get a chance to wake up ? "
" When are you going to be a social molecule ? "
It 's really easy , as soon as you 're opening up , and you 're interacting with ideas .
And you remember , what do people do ?
From 2007 , every two months in the city , the most respected streets in cities stop the <unk> of their children 's <unk> <unk> .
This is the city that tells her the kids : " You can . "
Think about the situation .
The <unk> streets are not glamorous .
There were Yves <unk> who helped us with <unk> .
The streets are the kids .
They 're <unk> , playing the streets .
<unk> , <unk> free , completely <unk> .
<unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> : Yeah , it 's a thousand years old .
We 're planning to do this in other places .
♫ Everyone 's <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> : The city will be free
There 's a child in the world , <unk> , a child .
<unk> : And now the city is taking care of their kids tomorrow .
♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> : So <unk> is already considered to be considered Chinese kids .
So , in order to make a model , <unk> was about 200 children .
And then there 's three <unk> of <unk> , and it 's going to continue evolving .
Now it 's in India .
So at the end of the day , 2009 was the same way in 2008 , and we said , " I ca n't tell you about 10 kids . "
So what do you do ? We 've done a simple tool into eight languages .
It 's just a very simple task to kids .
We say , chose a subject , anything you have for a week and change the lives of 10 billion people .
And they did it ! And so the story of change is in India , and the story begins in India , like <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
These are the solutions that children do .
From the absence of <unk> , <unk> the grass , 32 percent of the students from <unk> , <unk> from <unk> .
And I said , " How incredible that is ! "
And it says that when the adult trust , the kids say , " When you 're not talking about it , they 're <unk> .
Take a video clip , " <unk> <unk> . "
This is <unk> , a <unk> village .
<unk> : I do n't think I 'm illiterate , and I teach them how to <unk> .
For the first time , in a non - <unk> , liberal arts game , the streets of the streets , the streets of the streets , explaining the parents , very important .
Look at what their parents say .
<unk> : That 's great .
We learned from kids and writing , fantastic .
<unk> : My student was participating in this event .
And then I will never forget them .
Look . They 're doing it .
It 's a school in <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah . This is a <unk> .
We should start collecting <unk> .
The girl boy , she 's a little bit harder , but they did it !
<unk> : They 're young , but they 're good .
And they 've got our community in their community , and then the <unk> city , and then it 's the whole Indian .
This is a challenge for me , and I 'm not surprised to see that big energy .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
We have a lot of wonderful paintings that have taken out of this very , very proper purpose , which is going to be used for money to buy bad aids .
Are you ready ? Okay .
Okay ? Okay .
Okay ? Okay .
Well , a little bit better .
<unk> games , <unk> sport , <unk> activity .
And I think they 're changing life .
<unk> .
How do we do that , but also <unk> ?
Are you so passionate about this kind of passion ?
I know it 's obvious , but I have to end with a very strong change in an incredibly change .
70 years ago , a person in the entire country had a force called " I <unk> . "
And , today , who 's going to try to <unk> this prize for 10 million children in the U.S.
And before I heard about it , I said , " We , India , right ? "
So who could we have ?
No , do n't you ?
I said , <unk> is a good word .
Thank you .
<unk>
The architect is <unk> in his own work to show the computer how to do it , and how it can be designed to design the architect , the beauty of zero pollution .
architecture , green , productivity
<unk>
Yves <unk> 's research
It 's an architect , and you 're using it for the past , to design the world , for <unk> .
The green agenda may be the most important topic that people are looking at .
I want to share with you some experience in the last 40 years , and we celebrate 40 million of us -- to talk about sustainability .
Can you expect much more , what happens next to the next , and what is the threat , the challenge and the opportunity ?
I think -- I 've been in the middle of a couple of years , which is that before the idea of the green Foundation , it 's not for <unk> -- for survival .
But I 've never said that , but what I 'm going to talk about is something that is very , very meaningful .
I mean , it 's all about the way that all of the ideas are about to celebrate the life of life , and that 's where it is to celebrate quality and space .
I really did n't know anything about anything , so if I could , I 'm going to get out of the interview last year , and someone had asked this idea about how many people are , as an important observer , <unk> , writer , singer , an international <unk> .
And he said , I think in 2006 , the most important thing is to convince you about environmental concepts .
This year , we 've got a plate of life , <unk> , design , investing and production , people start understanding the presence of civic , entrepreneurs and government , and most of them can do the best , the most respected , entrepreneurial , most <unk> .
So my <unk> : <unk> is a new red , white , blue . "
And I asked myself , " How do you look at Earth and <unk> ? "
I want to come from the <unk> in the next 20 days , which is , the first time , humans look back .
From a certain way , <unk> <unk> created that word .
Before <unk> <unk> , I was honored to have a lot of the former Soviet Union in Russia and other places .
And so , interestingly , I was 10 , and they were the first real <unk> .
They 're highly passionate about a passionate passion for <unk> .
That time -- something happened .
It 's a <unk> of <unk> leaders -- it 's also not been created yet .
He 's a design scientist , and if you want , it 's an poet who expects everything 's happening .
So this is another subject , another talk .
And you can look at his work .
As soon as I was at the time , <unk> inspired attention , his citizens , the citizens of the Earth , influence my mind and doing what I was doing .
There are many projects .
I 've got this because it 's in 1973 , in the <unk> <unk> .
This may be a reduction in the Earth , and this is the <unk> of the earth .
And there 's some kind of trait that comes out of those statements .
These are the sorts of things that become common in our gut , and you know , 30 years later , the wind , recycling , China , solar cells -- solar cells .
And there 's a special design <unk> .
These are the effects that people who are really design about , who have the markings of <unk> , and the impact that he created for <unk> companies .
This is in the ' 50s , ' 60s .
Whether it 's <unk> is <unk> all of the stuff that 's going to make it , and technology will create a fantastic style -- close to the intimate , <unk> -- very hard to see what we see here .
And also , they 're going to be your size size .
And I think digital revolution is going to bring a lot of people out of the virtual world , and eventually , in fact , it has been affected by the world .
Maybe you can use <unk> or <unk> to summarize , like we 're forced to enjoy pleasure , <unk> , a much higher economy , and <unk> it .
A very , very beautiful object .
And it 's very interesting to be in the ' 50s and ' 60s , which is very broad .
<unk> the iPod to the <unk> , and the way it 's going to be done in the early ' 70s , which is very interesting , is that <unk> articles have been rejected by the fact that the Toyota is <unk> Toyota , that 's <unk> by <unk> <unk> and so on .
And I think we 're very easy to do that , whether it 's an architect or a design process , anyone who thinks that the solution is in the building .
The buildings are important , but they 're only part of that big .
In other words , I 'm going to try to say that if you can do that , like <unk> , you could design a house house .
That would be a solution to the solution .
<unk> , that 's not the way that we do it .
It 's just the beginning .
You ca n't stack up buildings from the city of the city .
For example , if , by <unk> our legitimacy , we 're going to take a step back to looking at the Earth , and we see a typical , industrial society , <unk> , transportation , traffic , the transportation .
But again , this is just the whole part .
If you 're going to look at architecture and traffic flow , people 's transportation , the rate of consumption , 70 percent of the energy consumption in the city and how it works .
And so the problem with <unk> is that it 's part of the city of architecture , the architecture of building cities .
For example , you compare these two cities , one new city , and I said , simplicity , a city of North America -- a lot of <unk> , <unk> the car .
The city of the city is spreading over the way , and more <unk> , more mesh , even more energy consumption in the corner of people -- so that the store , when it 's no longer people , they 're dead as the defender , as it will die .
If you compare <unk> to one city in Europe , it 's a good choice , a lot of <unk> , to walk , and that density , which is more than 10 percent of the city 's energy , but only 10 percent .
In other words , you can see that this is a huge amount of energy .
Basically , if you want to <unk> , you can say that in the bottom line , the increase in energy consumption is still lower .
And of course , you ca n't walk into social diversity , <unk> , urban spaces , mental spaces .
But you can see that the <unk> , the yellow part in the middle , has amazing powers , Copenhagen , Pennsylvania .
In Copenhagen , although it 's a population of population density , it does n't have a density of density .
A really interesting thing happened in 2000 .
And you see that the first time you saw about five percent of the city , or the giant city , started in developing countries .
Now , in <unk> , <unk> is a huge city in the developing world .
So you ask yourself -- for example , China or India , and what kind of environmental impact .
If you take China , or you 're just doing it for example , you look at its transportation , and it 's increasing pollution , when the automobile becomes cheaper .
In other words , if you have 1,000 cars per day , this is what 's going on here -- data is the world 's most reliable market market , and three <unk> of <unk> are currently losing .
This is a real fast leap in <unk> .
If , if you think about social change from the outside of the city , it 's the same process for 20 years .
<unk> told you quickly quickly .
Interestingly , about 60 years , we 've seen that life expectancy has doubled , and at three times <unk> .
If we look at the world , in the same period of time , technology is the tools of designer designers , and I 'm going to use my own experience as an example of my company , for example , how to measure the changes of technology ?
How do technology affect the design of the building ?
In particular , how do it <unk> us to create energy , <unk> , more social responsibility ?
And the story happened in the late ' 80s .
One of the examples that a military building is a building building , and it 's called <unk> and <unk> Bell , where the business town in the U.K. goes beyond in England .
First you see the roof of this building , like a big <unk> , a <unk> gardens , an shared space space .
In other words , this community has a air gardens .
And the idea of the human mind is <unk> in these paintings , and maybe it 's also covered in my early days , when you look at the sun , as you see it in nature .
Nature is one of the leading generators and <unk> of the building .
<unk> , the color of the interior is green to yellow .
It 's also a pool of apartments and <unk> , and there 's a lot of social work , a space center , which you can do with natural space .
That was the design of 1973 .
This building was a prize in 2001 .
Yves uses a long - term building .
People are building it together : the projects of the project , the <unk> .
They say that the building is always saying to the future , and it does n't make a lot of money .
So , we made his humor , let him happy .
On top of it , if you look at it carefully , it 's telling you , you can use this building .
This building is a building for change .
In 1975 , the image is <unk> .
When you shoot pictures , it becomes a computer .
And they said that the <unk> is our competition to build new technologies .
We 're lucky enough because we adapt to our buildings .
It estimated change .
So before I was doing this building , I spent a plate , and I 've taken it from printing .
And I said , " But we do n't have that time , we did n't do a lot of competition . "
In other words , we did n't have a lot of technology to build really interesting things .
So for example , create a kind of a <unk> bubble -- a very interesting orbit , and it 's going to breathe and ca n't you breathe .
Even though , in fact , this building is also a green building , the green building .
And if I look at it , the interesting thing about technology is that the technology is going to celebrate .
The free universities in the last year was an example .
From the top of the <unk> , it becomes an object that becomes physical .
There 's a lot of equipment that 's going to be used in the form of the <unk> , and it 's also the way that <unk> the library , so much energy , in a large amount of energy .
And interestingly , this is the love of the user interface .
And this brings us back to the idea of life , from a certain point of thinking about the ecology of ecology .
This is not a sacrifice , but it 's a opposite .
I think it 's a great thing to celebrate .
And you can measure the <unk> of environmental energy that will look at the energy of the building .
Let me give you another ecology of technology in different places -- this building in Switzerland .
Using the most traditional building , the material -- because there 's technology and computer sharing , it 's a very advanced building .
If you look at this technology , <unk> <unk> brings information into the air .
<unk> to Switzerland -- to a little bit of a small factory in Germany , you can see that there 's a guy standing in the <unk> , and the corner of the air comes up .
What 's on the left is that the company is able to capture this particular building , and it 's just a very small amount of size .
What 's interesting is that the building is going to cover the most ancient technique of the old technology , which is like a <unk> .
<unk> for 25 million dollars to finish the surface .
And again , the architecture of the building is the space that we 're enjoying there and the space that we live there .
I hopped up here to talk about these new technologies , and what happened ?
I mean , what 's the life that 's going to happen before the mobile phone , and sometimes what happens ?
And of course , architecture is still .
This is the percentage of the <unk> bank of 1979 , and in <unk> , they 're able to fold sunlight into the center of this space .
In no computers , you have to make <unk> .
For example , we 're going to model the <unk> on the sky .
We 're actually putting it in the <unk> , and we 're going to have a long - long amount of ice , etc .
For us , acting is happening in our first computers .
We 're exploring the <unk> <unk> .
And this is the fourth generation of <unk> <unk> , which is very typical , very large , huge , big windows , a lot of machines , large - <unk> and big <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the green city , <unk> solid energy , is a very glamorous space -- you know you 're there .
And the whole point is that it does n't need light -- because the lights will produce heat , and it 's increasing <unk> .
That 's that special moment that 's a normal independent computer .
That 's the institution of <unk> <unk> .
In 1990 , not a long year . This is our offices .
If you look at you , you 'll see you use pencil glasses , and they 're still using big boxes .
That 's not a long story , 17 years , look at us now .
It 's really a big shift .
When you look at earlier , there 's a woman named <unk> <unk> , and she 's going to have all the data on it .
Now , every week , our data is like <unk> <unk> , <unk> the past , and all of the projects that are in the future .
More than 21 kilometers across the sky .
This is what you see from that altitude .
But now you know , like Al Gore is saying that temperature will not stop <unk> , in this case , interestingly , these <unk> buildings come up with that place .
Our project in our Berlin Congress , and I think this is a problem for the <unk> , as the public space , which we want to find in the context of the environment , <unk> social and politicians , public spaces , where there is no need , the energy <unk> -- it does n't require fuel .
Use it to be <unk> .
Again , the chief of humanity becomes public space , but this ecology of the ecology .
But we do n't need an actual model .
Obviously , there 's a lot of the <unk> , but now the computer technology , for example , to exploration , and to explore how it 's going to work in nature . In the natural world , we can simulate the space .
<unk> , underground levels , burning ice -- this is the process of a <unk> design process , and interestingly , it 's a very interesting time .
We <unk> that technology to build clean , almost zero pollution .
And you can measure it again .
And you can compare this building every year in the last year -- at the project , it 's 7,000 tons of ice , and use gas , then it uses 35 tons .
Half the <unk> -- almost zero pollution .
We 've seen the same design , in <unk> -- nanotechnology , you can simulate the garden , rotate the form .
But again , it 's a place for life and quality , and a lot of <unk> .
And we can also measure the energy supply of the <unk> .
And in these projects , the <unk> of the Swiss have fallen further and closer to this development . This is in London .
This is a series of images that <unk> the simulation .
The first thing that 's going to show you , I think , is that you 're seeing circles and circles everywhere around the circle .
What do you need to put the same amount of space ?
So , for example , you can be able to build a space on a building for the <unk> , and you can make the same size .
And finally , you draw a <unk> .
These are kind of the same green lungs , <unk> , light , rhythm , turning architecture more fresh .
And then you 've got something that is <unk> in the face , and it 's going to take the whole building , which is the <unk> of the triangles -- and again , with some <unk> , the design of <unk> - <unk> and <unk> <unk> for the building .
If we look at this building , and now we use the computer , we can simulate it .
It also has the ability to work , regardless of how the wind is , how to keep <unk> and conservatives .
And what 's different about traditional buildings is that architecture is a <unk> orbit .
<unk> place , rather than <unk> .
The bottom line is public space .
What happens to the typical building , if we try to engage this design strategy , and what will happen ?
I 'm going to share with you two companies of research projects .
Everyone you know is death .
sea level is down , sort of like <unk> .
<unk> sea sea remains much larger than around the ocean .
So there 's a plan for a rescue plan , and the transportation station is sometimes <unk> , sometimes sometimes it 's sending <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
And our idea is , in the past 40 years , what if you do n't have to replace the <unk> , but to create a <unk> ?
Will it depend on the location of the <unk> , in the context of <unk> and the environment , the sea , the agricultural , the agricultural ?
In other words , water is life .
And if you look at this image , you see this <unk> region , a <unk> area where the military is connected together together , and it 's possible to put yourself together in common , in the most widely important meaning .
And so the big infrastructure also is also communication .
Whether it is in the virtual world , it 's the center of the world .
In the world , how do we make a difference , especially in some places I talked about -- China , in the next 10 years , will develop 400 new <unk> .
What would that be like ?
How do you make a larger <unk> for the environment ?
<unk> , I call it a different experience because you always have <unk> .
What if we 're going to move this into a Chinese society ?
And interestingly , it turns out that the result is the ultimate building building .
This is the largest project on Earth .
250 -- sorry , five people work 24 hours a day , seven hours a week .
There 's still a gap to the Grand Canyon associated with <unk> <unk> , including <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And this challenge is to create a green building , even though it 's a huge amount of purpose , and a lot of experience for the human race , in the way of traveling , to <unk> , which is very , very relevant to life .
Maybe it 's going to be a space that will be celebrate space .
As <unk> <unk> talked about it , we talk about the environment , saying that the city is speaking .
<unk> said , " These are new church . "
From a certain way , one of the things that happened is that when I said about China , it 's the green ideal and the <unk> .
I said to myself -- in that <unk> , it seems to be a symbol of 2006 to 2007 , maybe , the world is the most powerful , innovation .
As <unk> says , " We put people on the moon . "
If we 've completed the price of the <unk> fuel rate , get rid of <unk> <unk> .
This is a good platform .
It 's just a device , you know , it can <unk> .
I 'm going to tell you one idea , maybe in a new year , I think these ideas are probably coming from other countries , more countries -- China , India , <unk> .
Thank you very much .

Anil <unk> on the developing world -- the <unk> of the local <unk> , who are surrounded by poverty , and their ability to change a lot of people 's lives -- and he shows how to make these people who need the tools that they need to create what they want .
creativity , entrepreneur , innovation , invention , poverty

Anil <unk> : <unk> Indian innovation
I 'm going to give you one message , which is from tens of thousands of people , in the villages of the village , and in a country where they do n't do a lot of problems with their moral wisdom , it does n't have any help .
As soon as our own country announced , a couple of weeks ago , one of the <unk> wars in the Indian war is about 200 areas of war , and there are no <unk> management , but he <unk> a little bit .
In the last 21 years , we 've been dealing with a thing that 's probably very poor , but they 're going to do it .
<unk> said , the edge of the edges is not glamorous .
And it was this project that we launched in this place when we were 31 years old .
Where do we start ?
So let me tell you , simplicity is my personal journey , and it creates now .
In 1986 , I was born in the <unk> of <unk> and Congress , trying to help researchers work on the workforce , and if you go to development , it 's based on a lot of people 's wisdom .
I came back in 1986 .
And I was inspired by the knowledge and creativity that I found in the country , and this country has about 60 percent of the population , but the amazing creativity .
And I started to look at my job . I 've done it in the last 10 years , almost every time that people share it .
Now , I made dollars for dollars , as a coach , and I looked at my government <unk> trying to ask me , " Is that a connection to the people who have spread all these people to be able to make this possible knowledge . "
Because I do n't get the reward , or [ unclear ] ?
Because is I good enough ?
Am I good at me ?
Is it a better answer to me ?
Because I 'm a professor , or , is n't it ?
I tried to convince myself , " No , no , I have to change policy .
You know , policy will be more concerned about the needs of people , and that , I think , is good . "
But I found that these years I 've been involved in openness to openness , being approved , and I realized that maybe maybe I was also a <unk> , because in my income , there was no way to show that this income was happening because these people were able to do it because of those people who share their wisdom , religious and trust people .
So that 's what I did when I was in English .
Most of the people I 've been interested in .
And I wondered : What did I do ?
And I was talking about social justice , and I 'm a trained expert , which I 've got to get out of the world , from people , to <unk> them , because this knowledge of knowledge is given to a lot of people who are wealthy , wrote a lot of the articles on the table , written in articles .
And then there 's a <unk> in the mind , if I 'm a vegetarian , that 's not right , life ca n't .
It 's a very painful moment because I ca n't live on this .
So if I look at the values of social and management research , there 's about 100 articles reading about 10 articles .
And then I get a conclusion , although <unk> is special , <unk> does n't work , but the solution has to be special .
And a day -- I do n't know what to say -- when I go home from the office , maybe I see a bee in my consciousness , and if I can become an bees , life might be fantastic .
And the job of the bee is , they feed the nectar , and they get nectar and to deliver the other , to the other .
And when it gets the nectar , it does n't feel very uneasy .
In fact , the flowers are not glamorous because of the <unk> , and the bee does n't keep all the papers .
And the social social societies have three <unk> -- that 's whether we learn something from other people , and they also have to share with them .
They have to get disbelief instead .
And I have to tell you , 20 years later , I focused on this behavior that never changed .
And it makes me feel like I 'm still doing this kind of behavioral act , and I hope all of you are going to have the ability to <unk> the knowledge of the other .
This is the research research in the United States , or in the U.K.
Or the Indian Science Foundation did n't ask , no matter what you learned from others to share with them .
What we 're talking about is a social social society , a fair society . But we do n't even do a lot of justice .
And India wants become a knowledge society .
How do you make a knowledge society ?
And obviously , we ca n't have two different kinds of <unk> , one for ourselves .
This system has to be the same .
There is no <unk> .
It does n't matter only as well as the values of its own values , and it 's the same distance .
So , <unk> ca n't be cut .
Look at this photo .
Can you tell me where it was , and who would you say to me ?
I 'm a professor , and I have to do it .
Who ? Even if I guess ?
Sorry ?
Anil gets <unk> : But what 's the photo ?
Sorry ?
You know , you 're right . We have to give him <unk> because this person knows how much of our government is .
Look at this . This is <unk> 's area .
It attracted a lot of <unk> to watch our country .
I 'm sorry for me .
This is a beautiful photo -- or is it bad or bad ?
This is exactly how you see the lives of people .
There 's a woman who 's going to walk through the head , and there 's hundreds of miles across the head , and you ca n't feel good for it .
We have to do something .
So let me tell you , all of the technologies we have , hundreds of thousands of women still need to use their head to <unk> water .
We did n't ask ourselves .
You have lunch every morning .
Time to think about it .
<unk> , Fox <unk> . You know what this is doing is a series of action , and it 's a range of <unk> <unk> that <unk> them down behind the basket .
If you do that , you 'll see how hurts you are .
She needs to do a few times a day .
Your lunch pressure , you 're going to eat it tomorrow , which is the women who are <unk> <unk> , hundreds of thousands of women , and every half of them , when they 're burning , they are the ft .
The foot swells up in the ice , infection , and infection is <unk> , because the insects will bite .
And every year , <unk> percent is silent .
Nobody invented this machine .
So the astronomy of the scientist , technology , public policy , is the Ashanti epidemic , and that 's the epidemic of our attention , not the way that we do n't continue to go .
This is not what our Congress can do , you know . We have labor programs . Two million people get 100 days from this country .
What do you do ? They get toes , they dig .
We asked the authorities about Congress , and they have the minds of the people ?
The poor man has legs , <unk> , but no one ?
And the bee networks are also very glamorous in the middle of the poor .
But what happened ?
<unk> , without a facial , have no names , and they have a identity .
That 's the way that bee works .
This network itself is growing up , and continue to grow forward , but also trying to develop the moral wisdom of our country and the world in other areas .
They might be the innovation of education ; culture 's innovation ; the institutions of innovation , but our job is in technology , and it 's based on creative innovation .
And they all started curiosity .
They all start curiosity .
And this man , we 've seen , you 're going to meet you in the site , <unk> , he 's a community , and he has a wish .
And he said , " If I wish to be true -- people are sick and they need <unk> -- " God , please care him .
If you have a <unk> , I 'll put it on the wall . "
And that 's his painting .
Somebody 's talked about the needs of <unk> yesterday .
There are no more mistakes than the <unk> of the human mind , because the poor people in this country are <unk> .
<unk> , and all the great <unk> of all of them are poor people , they have a big reason .
You need to be satisfied with other needs to think about your mental demand .
And anyone who does n't need to go to the opposite , they have to get out of the way that they can fix their <unk> .
Look at this .
We saw it in <unk> , every six months , we 're all going to go to India .
Over the last 12 years we walked up to 40 million .
And at the end of the road , I found that ice bears , they can also be fuel .
You see this woman , she 's standing on the underside of the <unk> wall , and she gets a painting .
And this is where she 's the only place to express her own creativity .
And she 's great .
Look at this woman , <unk> <unk> , who was at a level of gravity , and we were running out of the place where we had the pain of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Look what she did .
The whole walls are cable games . She sits down there .
A <unk> or a artist ?
And obviously he was a artist ; she was an <unk> man .
If we can make a market , we do n't just hire them to dig them down or die .
They 're going to do it because they 're good for the <unk> , rather than those who do n't do good .
And look at what <unk> did .
There 's a lot of people who are sold in the head of the ice , and so many people sell <unk> , obviously , <unk> .
You can get soda in the morning every morning .
So he thought , why do n't we <unk> the <unk> ?
This <unk> is only a few hundred years .
There 's a lot of people who stack them up , they add <unk> and dust , and then they 're able to get <unk> .
This is a real and rugged <unk> .
Look at what Julian <unk> did .
Many people do n't have enough corn supplies .
So this man is <unk> with two pennies .
And if you have 500 <unk> , 1,000 <unk> of this machine can help you ; normal <unk> are usually not like that small .
Know understanding the poor .
These people have some of their needs , and they have the most effective values in energy and quality .
They do n't want the quality or the product .
But they want to have good things that they need to get their right technologies .
This is what <unk> did .
But he did n't do that . Look at this .
If you have a clothing , he can give you a <unk> machine .
There 's a two - mile washing machine ...
He 's going to be on your shoulders with you .
And her water and <unk> , and I can do this machine for you , just one pile of <unk> and building a new business model .
Now we need a little bit of people who can fix the scale of the commercial scale .
Look at this .
It looks like a beautiful picture .
But you know what this is ? Anybody can guess ?
<unk> people to know , certainly .
This is a <unk> .
It 's a plate of glue .
So what do you do ?
A <unk> , spending about 250 dollars , five dollars per year .
This is an approach to a dollar dollar , and this is a <unk> <unk> .
And the best place in the place is , when you have a expensive <unk> , you 're eating something called a <unk> material , or something like that , because , after a period of time , what happened ?
<unk> to you . He did n't invent it .
You know , but here , this leopard <unk> , it does n't kill you .
So this is even better ; it 's more safe ; it 's more inexpensive ; it 's still .
It does n't have to say that poor people are not going to be <unk> or <unk> .
It 's better , much more efficient , and it has to be cheaper .
This is what <unk> did .
You designed a <unk> for this kind of stuff .
As long as one dollar , you can get a better choice than this market .
This woman , she developed a hardware store .
We developed a patent .
And who knows , some people create <unk> using this technology and explore the product of the market , and she 's going to get income .
Now , let me give you one thing . I think we need a little bit of a developed model in this country and in different areas of the world , and it 's a very efficient way of dealing with the world .
A better adaptation in sustainable areas .
You want to ramp it up , but it 's really not enough to get people to do it , and it is n't enough .
Why is anyone willing to push this away ?
It can expand , and it 's already progress .
For example , this country has four billion cellphones .
Now , it 's possible to use two buttons in my cellphone , three functionality .
And he 's 300 ; I 'll give you 300 or three , and I 'm going to have it with three .
But if I have to find smaller , obviously , I need different phones .
What I 'm going to say is that you should n't become sustainable enemies .
There 's a way to have a solution to the world , and it 's even possible to find ways to encourage this .
One of the most great studies in all of us is a lot of investors who ask this question -- " What is the demand for the model ? "
And the result is that you 're going to lower your demand to optimize , and you 're being rejected by a macro - place or something .
The famous two - meter model tells you that a lot of the volumes of <unk> - <unk> books are still a active model .
We have to find the way that people can be able to focus their values , and we 'll invest in a lot of people in this combination , to come up with a very few of them .
Look what he is doing .
<unk> is a great guy .
At the age of 70 , he did a very inventive thing .
<unk> : I ca n't wait .
I had to meet my love .
My despair made me become an inventor .
<unk> needs to help technology .
<unk> is the power of my wife , right ?
My innovation is my passion .
My technology .
<unk> : There are people who are <unk> people in the head .
The great people , but he still needs to sell , in this age , to <unk> honey , and to make money , because he 's not able to persuade people who live the <unk> <unk> , the corporate <unk> .
We did n't persuade the person who had been in the lap of a few years ago , and people had to walk 20 miles per year , to see , you 're going to have to do this , because you could n't go to the table .
So what we 're going to do is we have a problem with this kind of donor machinery , which is the <unk> of <unk> , when you need access to transportation .
But this idea is a <unk> ; there 's a <unk> .
What do you do ? Unfortunately , unfortunately , I 've got a message , but she 's left .
A very powerful information : I looked at the world every day .
It was n't like a coconut stamp on my head , and I came up with this idea .
There 's no money to do my research . I 'm not going to work .
Now they call me the " <unk> <unk> . "
My technology .
<unk> : There are many of you probably probably wo n't find and believe that we 're selling this product to the world -- and I call it <unk> <unk> .
A trained professors of a college college , who bought this <unk> , because she wanted to study a variety of diversity .
And this device is going to get a lot of dust from the Grand Canyon , and it 's not enough to do that , so she does n't have the same machine , she has to use this machine .
So , you 've seen this in the future of science .
Yves <unk> invented ...
You can go to YouTube and find India , and then you find these videos .
When she was just 10 years old : A <unk> and <unk> engines .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , and he 's only half a million .
But it changed the <unk> to help him with free and conservatives .
This invention came from <unk> <unk> .
This guy , Mr. <unk> .
And what we 've been talking about , my friend 's friends , how to expand this model in China and in Brazil .
And we 're especially part of a very chaotic network , but also in other parts of Brazil and the rest of the world .
This <unk> , you ca n't find one another .
India and China have the most entrepreneurial motorcycle .
But this was happening in Brazil .
And the point is that we do n't need to <unk> , we should not believe that only our country can have good ideas .
No , we need to use the knowledge of the poor , whether it 's where they are .
Look at the invention of these motorcycle motorcycle : <unk> motorcycle , motorcycle <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I ca n't change the <unk> ; I can make a bike .
That 's -- I do n't know .
In South Africa , we 're helped to share the <unk> , and we can share them with the South African colleagues who share these things as a symbol of free .
They engineered this <unk> .
It 's a 30 , 40 <unk> <unk> , which is a purpose .
Put it down , the car is injured .
This is in China . This girl takes a breathing device .
And this three <unk> sat down and decided , " How do we keep this girl in the village ? "
They did n't relate to her , but they tried to figure out how to make the answer , how we use the washing machine , they used a motorcycle , and they built a <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> her life , and this invention was a lot of people welcome .
We have different inventions .
A car cost six million miles per gallon .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You ca n't find this car in the U.S. or Europe , but it 's in India .
Now this lady , she used to get out of the <unk> .
One day , <unk> , she had to be <unk> until they did two <unk> .
Fifty years of fighting , this is what her son did .
She said , " Change your profession . "
And he said , " I ca n't . This is the only thing I know to do , but I 'm going to invent a machine that you can solve . "
This is what he did in <unk> .
And this is exactly what we 're working on with the <unk> <unk> : " Give me a <unk> , I can move Earth . "
And I 'm going to tell you about the competition of creativity in the kids , including all sorts of things .
We <unk> things around the world , from Ethiopian Australia to anywhere .
The product went into a few market .
The knowledge of these people makes sense of healing , which is possible .
This is a company that <unk> used to use this piece of art technology to put the police photos in the <unk> , and they can see that it can be able to be a remix .
If you have a thought , send us . "
Anyway , the vision of the imagination , knowledge matters , is innovation .
And it 's not just about physical motivation , but mentally motivation .
Thank you .
<unk>
And the light designer is <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to show you a world in the world -- to focus on the uses of light , and it can not ignore the use of the dark .
architecture , design
<unk>
Yves <unk> : <unk> with light
There 's a very tragic <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
This is n't my sentence .
This is <unk> <unk> .
And here you can see that he 's going to say that this is one of the beautiful buildings in which he designed a lot of cool buildings -- the French church , the light in the dark .
This is the next 18 minutes , and it 's not the right thing to do with the <unk> of the health and the light of <unk> .
All of our offices are both like this .
And you can think of it as a lot of money , and you should think that it should be a luxury and <unk> .
We use this <unk> light on the walls and the streets of the wall .
This kind of <unk> and <unk> that I showed you earlier is different .
If we compare this to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> would n't look like this , because this beautiful light of light is going to vary in the same building as well as possible .
This is the " <unk> " of the <unk> , " in my design , a little bit like this .
And he 's not going to enjoy the <unk> of a food diet that 's much more powerful than a dish , and it 's a very mesh - based design design for people who are <unk> .
And in this building , you can see that the sky can enjoy sunlight .
And so he designed these fabulous buildings , even if you see the sky , and you can see that the air is able to enjoy sunlight , so the buildings that make us more happy , because he pushes light with shadow .
<unk> , that 's the sun .
This image of the sun shows the side of our Sun 's <unk> , but remember all the energy on the planet , it 's a form of energy .
The sun is active ; it suppresses light .
And for us to create beauty , as this building is shown in the museum of the Japanese Museum of <unk> in Atlanta , the <unk> Foundation has collaborated with the British <unk> , and this design is used in a lot of light on the bottom of this space , which is going to make a little amount of flexibility in that space .
So people feel the sun .
And that 's how they use this crucial architecture to improve the texture of the space .
And you can see that they 're designed to see the shape of this shape , which can not get into the sun .
And then you can see that their whole design process underlies the laws of <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of two <unk> came out of an end to the whole building .
When design was designed some perfect place .
And you can see , here , there 's some light coming out of the floor , but they can immediately discriminate from where it comes from .
They make the buildings real really happy sunlight , enjoy the good side of the sun .
Of course , the sun has a lot of different ways .
It can be like this , but the way it is , it 's a little bit weird , and that 's actually the <unk> of the United States in <unk> .
And the sun looks like it 's too noisy , so people think about this funny way .
And then I want to introduce you to this image of the sun , showing you the effects of sunlight , the light that goes into the building , and the light goes into the quality of the building .
This is the <unk> of light in the same same way -- because there 's no dark touch , because you 're looking at this change .
And I 'm going to show you one of the different sorts of offices that starts at the beginning , and the offices are really close to what 's called the " White House . "
<unk> to green energy or something like business .
They do n't have their business , and it does n't use a <unk> light .
It 's just on the side of the wall , and there 's a huge amount of sunlight at the bottom there , the sun 's sun is able to show the high quality of the high - wing <unk> at the <unk> .
And when you work , sometimes light becomes ugly sometimes and become bright .
But the eyes of human eyes are very well adapted to all of these light changes , and it 's the same thing that allows the whole system to <unk> the entire environment , to improve our lives .
I have to introduce you to this person today .
His name is Richard <unk> , who 's born a hundred years ago , and this is why I 'm going to bring him to this , because this is his age of 100 king .
In the 1930s , Richard Kelly is one of the leading concepts of modern art .
And he proposed three concepts , focus lights , <unk> and <unk> , and this three - dimensional concept is very different from the concept of design , which is the three of the beautiful experiences of modern architecture .
Let 's start with focus light .
And the idea of the focus is that the <unk> of light in the space of space that people have found that they want to go to places like this .
Or this is the light - designed design of the <unk> of <unk> .
And you go into the room , and you say , " Oh , this is too glamorous , but it 's a very glamorous light that 's made in the middle .
This is a little bit of a theater that I would like to say about the theater .
It focused on the surface of the actor to focus on actors .
The focus is also the sun that goes through the walls of the clouds , and it 's only a little bit of a small land .
Or like in the rural areas , the military companies use <unk> <unk> to <unk> the commodity , creating a kind of defense for you .
The environment is completely different .
Richard Kelly looks at it as an infinite space , without attention , and all the details are in this infinitely space .
I think it 's a very comfortable light that allows me to relax and relax .
And it can be like this : This is the Japanese Museum of Science in London , the <unk> Japanese museum .
At the end of the project , <unk> <unk> is a great example , or a big example of this -- or maybe it 's a huge amount of <unk> in this theater , and it is very interesting for the whole building of a cake .
And these three different concepts made the whole thing more than our life .
We do n't have the ability to create these .
And I 'm going to explain a little bit about that .
And I thought , Richard Kelly , on the left , is the right thing to explain to <unk> Van <unk> .
And what they 're behind behind is the Islamic <unk> System , and it 's the symbolic symbol of the building .
And that time , there were people who started trying to try and experiment with light .
This is one photo of the American National Library of Medicine , where people are placed under the sun .
This is a very different view of what the sun 's going to do today for you today .
In the modern realm of modern medicine , people are already concerned about <unk> light .
One of the things that we do is we look at things like ours , and the <unk> of our eye .
But if you look at what we 're going to wake up , when you 're shooting back , it 's a <unk> of <unk> and apathy , but this <unk> is shaped by blue light .
If you look at the right controls of the lights in our environment , you can help people <unk> or adjust the <unk> , to keep it down to stopping or <unk> .
And now we can do that , but maybe in the future , hospital can be able to control the patient faster and better , better reliable .
It could be used in the plane to help people <unk> the injury .
And it can be able to raise kids in this classroom to improve their kids .
There are more examples of that .
But then I want to continue to talk about the effects of light with light and darkness .
The same thing is , in social interactions , the light is <unk> us with ours .
It 's the place we want to connect with each other .
It 's a planet .
When you look at this planet , it looks like this .
I think that 's the most terrifying picture of me today .
Because these lights are all lined up on the sky .
They do n't look like the outside of the ground .
These lights are not used for humans .
They 're just the beauty of <unk> darkness .
From the world perspective , images became like this .
This is a very glamorous situation , and you can see how much light you 're going to see from the sky at the bottom there .
And if you do n't have these <unk> lights , it 's the Earth 's face , and we see that Earth should be a glamorous painting , which allows us to predict our imagination , <unk> us and our relationship with knowledge .
But this world has changed the way that the <unk> is changing .
And this photo was taken two weeks ago , and I did n't have a lot of shadow about the shadow of this building .
It 's just a little city , and it 's really amazing about the speed of <unk> .
We have to start thinking about these problems : what 's the way people are doing this in many emerging areas of the emerging city ?
How do people share other cultures ?
How do you solve the problem ?
What do you see here ?
It seems that the new light technology seems to be able to apply the light to the <unk> of the world , to create more than a <unk> place .
And before soon , we still use light in this light bulb .
And of course , we 've got metal lights associated with <unk> or something like that .
Now we have LED lights here , and you can see a new one , two very small .
This is a piece of light for us now , a unique opportunity , because the tiniest size of this is that we 're completely able to bring it around .
It does n't need to be <unk> when it comes to it .
I think this is a very good idea . It provides a new kind of new building , and it 's a way of looking at it .
Now , I want to show you how LED works , but it 's very small , and my little little <unk> can take four LED , so you ca n't see it .
So I decided to think about it , and then they said , " No problem , we can do it . "
And so they 've come up with this particular talk for me special to talk about the largest LED <unk> in the world .
That 's it .
This is the same thing on the screen -- but it <unk> 200 times .
And I 'll explain to you now .
It works .
These LED <unk> are both blue .
This is what it looks like if you look at this .
So we 're going to zoom in on the LED , and we 're going to get a <unk> .
And the <unk> is filled with blue light , and the end of the <unk> becomes warm .
And then on on top of the lens , it 's a place where you 're going to cross the <unk> , and the ideal place to <unk> the sky , to prevent the sky or something else .
And this can be really <unk> to <unk> the dark .
I just want to be in front of you and you can understand it .
Thank you .
Let 's continue on .
That 's the way we 're going to do this in our cities .
And we should be <unk> whether we 're going to make sunlight as a city .
Why is the ice ceiling ?
Really ?
Is it possible that the light should have some <unk> that we can benefit from the dark ?
Are we going to be <unk> in the light ?
Like this -- this is a relatively weak state .
Can we say that we 're going to have a lot of people who are participating in this energy lamp project , and they can also be able to fold a better place like this .
Or do n't we just design this kind of sculpture , whether it 's all beautiful from inside the outside ?
Can we protect light from dark light ?
Because it 's been really easy to find this place in the world today .
Finding that in the <unk> of the sky .
Even in the ocean , huge amount of light is affecting the health of the wildlife health .
For example , it 's known to know that birds in the birds are in migration because of the surface of these sea platforms .
And we found that if we 're going to move these lights into green , these birds are not getting <unk> .
It does n't work .
That 's the importance of <unk> <unk> .
From all of these examples , I think we 're going to start using darkness to use darkness as a canvas -- as visual artists like <unk> , such as <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> had a lot of <unk> .
And when I see this painting , what do you think ?
Where do they come from ?
What happened ? Five minutes later , what happens ?
It 's because of the <unk> of <unk> light and dark light , which allows the story to fold all the stories of all the stories .
<unk> <unk> is using light with pure <unk> using a real passionate commitment .
We can study and create more and more interesting buildings .
We can do this kind of design .
And you can also go out and enjoy the most glamorous <unk> of the universe , which is the universe itself .
This is a group of fun , and they have a lot of stuff on the corner of downtown ice , looking at the sky and see the stars that can see stars , even if it 's a nice <unk> <unk> .
Same thing for architecture .
And if you look at the design of the <unk> , it 's more important to design the environment that we 're designing , and our lives are coming from that .
Next is a very famous example , <unk> church church .
And I 'm going to show you the Swiss <unk> of Peter <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> and the whole space of darkness .
Richard <unk> is designed for London in London , and you can still see the sky in the air .
And the last thing I want to say is that there are many theories that come from this theater .
And I really 'm really happy that you 're going to be in the theater , and you 've got to experience the <unk> . I think we should all agree with that theater .
And if you do n't have a lot of <unk> today , it does n't have to have that <unk> effect .
And I think that this theater is a place that can actually use light to improve our lives .
Thank you .

Dean Kamen on inventing <unk>
As you say , every time you 're going to see something about something .
This is the end of the world , in the next morning , from <unk> <unk> , where people do n't sit down .
I should tell them earlier .
A couple of people who came up with a new idea .
They believe that three to 50 years later , they can use wires to drive , without all mechanical equipment .
This is <unk> .
And then they 're going to use some other devices , and they do n't need the mechanical components .
That 's good , why do n't you get the wire ?
So you can drive it .
I want to talk about technology , 15 minutes later , and the technology in the audience talks about what 's going to happen .
But before , I 'm going to say , from technology , important not technology .
And of course , when we apply technology to <unk> <unk> , this is important .
But I think the problem is , using a simple problem to solve a huge problem on transportation .
From one point : There 's a lot of data to show you in different forms .
You do n't know why the car is changing the world .
About a hundred years ago , Ford started producing T <unk> .
And what I think people do n't think is the context of technology .
So for example , 90 percent of Americans live in the countryside and town .
So the car is <unk> off the lawn , and it 's a very important speed , it 's much more important than the horse .
<unk> are less than half the road .
It 's also improving the <unk> , because in <unk> Manhattan , you can imagine that it 's a lot of <unk> when it comes to the road , and they 're all going to go through a whole range of people and other problems .
So the car is much more dynamic .
The cars are also allowing people to go to the town .
And this gives us an intimate population .
In the 1950s , we built the Israeli system to connect all the town , and this is a lot of people called the World Wide Organization .
It 's certainly a miracle .
And at the same time , because I 'm interested in the old technology , I want to assure you -- particularly very supportive of our <unk> : I do n't think that innovation will be <unk> or car competition .
But think about the world today .
There are half of the world 's population .
It 's three steps .
All of the transit issues have been solved by this world , to shape it to the present .
Fifty - five years ago , we 've developed <unk> <unk> , and we 've found that we 've found <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> train was to let us develop a continent .
In the rest of the century , we started building cars in the next high speed to connect all the city , so that our lives are very improved .
But at the same time , it 's more than a lot of kids who are born in the city .
And in the future , 15 , 30 percent of the Chinese have <unk> <unk> .
So none of them <unk> in 50 years of aircraft to transform the continents into a community .
If you look at how technology 's been done , we 've done a long - term increase in the transportation process , which is the <unk> problem .
Nobody wants to <unk> these techniques .
And of course , I did n't have my airplane <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
I do n't put them in my house . I love them .
The truth is , the problem is that when you 're the last half of the population , it 's <unk> <unk> .
And the most popular people have spent a lot of money on the <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
I do n't know how the data that 's going to make you feel <unk> in the United States of America , to 40 percent of the global population of greenhouse gas .
There are three million tribes that are all over the planet every year , and all of the <unk> pollution is from the vehicle , especially in the <unk> .
Moreover , I 'm not going to drive any corporate industry , and I really love my airplane and every hour , six miles per hour in the corner of the highway , every 18 miles of <unk> , two miles away from the Wikipedia consumption and the benefits .
We love our toes , and I 'm all love .
And the problem is , if you go into the Grand Canyon , it 's boring and very boring .
It 's lower .
If you look at China in 1998 , four million people bike hundreds of thousands of people driving <unk> .
If the people who have become a Republican Republican would want to go out in the past , 50 percent of the time we walked across the road , and half of them were <unk> the city , because no enough oil does n't have enough of it .
Now , what do we do here ?
We can make the problem , but what is the world right now ?
For me , somebody 's going to die in the last <unk> , and we 're working on the development of development , but we think that once we developed success , you do n't need water .
Or you have a pop transplant , you do n't need dust .
Or <unk> , this is pure entertainment , and you still love playing around .
And also , there 's only a couple of hundred years of <unk> , which is a hundred billion dollars .
There is no consensus that we often do that , and I think if we do n't put all the money in the world , it 's focused on understanding the other world 's problems , to start <unk> the city , back to the ancient World War II , which is where people are going to get rid of the cities , as well as all of the transit problems have been solved as well as Moore 's Law , so that all of these communities have solved , as all the debates are trying to be solved .
I mean , look at <unk> Steven <unk> through the continent , trying to take a lot of time in the continents , with trains and planes .
All the transportation evolved .
We went back to the city .
Cities became much more <unk> .
Most of the cities in the city are <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Tokyo , or Paris -- most of them are in downtown downtown .
65 percent of the areas in the foreground are <unk> .
Global <unk> across the world .
And you might say , well , if the city can <unk> the <unk> , what do you think we 're doing ?
What if we can make cities more and more enjoyable , more <unk> ?
And if you can get access to the last level of transit , go to your car , so we can all live in the <unk> , and we 're going to live on the police , to <unk> the city as well ?
It 's a very good problem to do that , and one of the problems we 're looking at is how to walk on the <unk> .
Because I have motors and wheels , and I 'm a car .
But I do n't look like a blank cord .
And I 'm going to leave you with the same amount of abilities that are going on in the <unk> , and that 's where the other people are doing .
I came up with a hour in the world .
And I 'm a man . But the laws are usually the <unk> of the law , and if we ca n't get the developer , we have two options .
We can be completely <unk> , but I do n't spend time on this .
Or we should go on the street to a car or a sedan .
We 're very concerned about this problem , and we 've got the first one to show him and say , " You know , I 'm going to tell you , you guys have trust this , so everybody 's trust .
They should be used in the sidewalks , they 're going to use it . "
And he said , we 're going to have a police department where they want to get rid of the community , and they 're trying to go into a community community and carry this 70 pounds of <unk> .
I do n't believe that police will glue themselves .
So we really have a lot of <unk> , but we know that the development of technology does n't look like <unk> and technique .
We 've got a lot of people who are willing to pay enough money , let 's develop this stuff for enough time to make them happy .
I 'd love to talk about this .
And this is really interesting , and you 're going to get out of the way .
If I ask you to do something , not as a technology , but imagine , we all understand that we use this <unk> <unk> machine for every hour of every 18 miles per hour , and it 's bad for us to go to the place where we 're going to use it .
One of the most exciting things we 've ever learned is that it might be accepted , and it 's happening in California .
A few weeks ago , we launched a piece of news in Florida , and we took a news assignment to the <unk> , where it 's going to come up with a little girl who came out of the door and came up to a <unk> woman to go and visit her , she went on and she looked at me , so she was looking at it . And she would stop seeing me .
How do we say that ?
So I said , " Yes . "
And I went down , she was like <unk> , and she did it , so she got over 20 feet away . She did this .
She went back to her , and she said , " Well , somebody 's going to make something . "
<unk> down to her face .
And I said , " Ooh , women , please do n't say anything . "
And the camera is still telling her her <unk> , and she said , " What does that mean ? "
And I thought , " It 's all over . She 's looking at it , and she looks , she 's still looking for those people , saying , ' No , I ca n't wake up , ya , but I do n't say they 're 50 years old . "
And she looked up , and she said , " I 'm going to get older . I ca n't drive .
I 'm going to go to the store , and I ca n't speak a lot . "
And I realized that , in many of my romantic fear , it was n't just propaganda , <unk> authorities or <unk> , and basically , there 's a lot of <unk> from the group that you do n't want to do that .
And when you look at the laws of the law , the eight feet of <unk> , and three feet , plus three degrees Fahrenheit and then the rest of this room is left .
But she looked like this , she realized that kids would n't care about those things , and they did n't vote , they were n't going to die , so I assumed that I was the unconscious .
So , as soon as you see this , it 's about eight years later , I 'm going to ask the story of the market , and the friends of our market and the laws are called <unk> ; they call them <unk> .
We have to show them .
And then they bring it to Washington , and show them , they 're going to come up with projects and see how to look at these things in a few cities , like Atlanta , for example , in the local <unk> .
And the bottom line is , whether you believe that the U.N. or whatever , or other <unk> , all population growth will concentrate cities .
We have a billion people in Asia .
They learned to use mobile phones .
They do n't have to go through a hundred years of progress .
They start from the top of the technology .
We have to start building cities and human environments , to <unk> people who are <unk> , and they 're able to use the <unk> of the individual , <unk> and <unk> .
Cars do n't fit in space cycle , and they 're moving in cities . They 're <unk> machines , but think of the <unk> and high speed .
The Greeks came from the <unk> , and he came out of his <unk> .
And you 're wearing <unk> .
Change is not going to change .
If you move faster than the speed of speed , three steps -- three minutes -- five minutes later .
If you live in <unk> , your choice is 10 times -- if you want to get half a hour , you need other ways , <unk> or train , and we 're going to have to build it -- that 's the light -- you 'll have to do it .
But if you 're in most of the cities , imagine you have half a hour in the city , and you get half of them .
If you can make it interesting , put it in a 10 minute 10 minutes , you ca n't get rid of the Grand Canyon , and you do n't want to go , <unk> , drive , drive , go somewhere else .
You can change the way that the world 's resources depended on resources that are interesting to make it interesting .
We want history to prove that we 're right .
It 's called <unk> , and we 've got a lot of work with it .
<unk> is generating electricity .
Yeah , it can be done right , using a <unk> , you 're going to go from New York to Boston .
Maybe this little machine is even more interesting , and it 's going to burn any fuel , because you have a certain amount of traits that might be <unk> in most places , where you can not be able to get out of the <unk> of 12 <unk> .
In fact , we 're working on this kind of alternative energy company to start with <unk> , because you can get the best battery in the ice , and when you 've got 20 watts per day , it 's about 20 yards per gallon when it comes to the ceiling of the <unk> ice ceiling , when the leopard <unk> goes down and down at six <unk> hours and so nobody 's going to have a <unk> at the time .
But at any point , it 's going to fall in the same speed , because it is burning the outside , and if you 're swimming in your house , then you can burn it .
So , for example , this makes a lot of power to do that in other places , and there 's enough electricity , as Dr. <unk> demonstrates , started the computer and <unk> .
What 's interesting about it is that you 're not going to get more than 10,000 percent of the population .
And the relationship is that if there 's 200 watts of power , it 's going to produce <unk> heat to the water .
If you want to make water , and you 're going to multiply it for every hour of 10 gallons per hour , get 25 percent of the <unk> <unk> -- 20 million dollars a year to achieve .
That 's a lot of energy , and you ca n't use it in this way or <unk> .
And of course , in other parts of the world , your choice is to destroy the place , put all the <unk> into heat , or <unk> the water .
The world is a world of killer destruction .
<unk> you believe that <unk> number two is six to six thousand people per day .
We do n't have the heart epidemic .
We need water .
Women should n't be paid for four hours looking for water or looking at the child .
What we 're looking at is how to zoom in on the ice , and we put it on top of the <unk> <unk> , using a little amount of power , which is a year in the process of malaria , for a few hour per hour .
If you put the box in this few years , we 're able to do a solution on the top of this <unk> - <unk> box , electricity , communication , maybe water problems ?
I do n't know , but we 'll try .
I have to do it .

Chris Anderson on the wall of technology
I want to talk about technology . That 's the question that many of you have focused on , because of the reason we care about it .
Obviously , for technology , the trend trend is we need to write and understand things .
But to all of you , your readers live in the future , so we 're going to prepare .
We 're going to have a few months later that we need to be ready for a couple of months ago , and we have to read it six months after the public , even nine months away , so what we do is we predict jobs .
We also do that with other industries , which is building products in technology .
In this case , our product is ideas and information , and if you 're lucky enough , it 's the same thing .
So we need to understand only why some technologies are important , and they 're going to move more importantly , when it 's time .
What 's interesting is that when you look at some of the projections in the late ' 90s , the <unk> of Sylvia 's projections , or about the Internet , and the speed of <unk> and <unk> , it 's all the right time , but they 're all right .
And almost every few years later that 's become true .
But a few years of the variation in the market , obviously , is very big , so it 's all about it .
You 've probably seen this before .
This is the classic <unk> curve , and I talked about technology .
And for fun , we 've got a lot of technology on top of it , and we 're going to show you that they 're opening up to the first peak , or <unk> , in the early age of the era of <unk> .
This is a way of <unk> technology , which is , in fact , where technology is .
We 're interested in trying to figure out any important technology that we think enough , and we 're usually doing twice .
The first time for those of you who liked to get rid of these information , we 've gathered these new technologies .
You can see that we put Linux on the cover of Namibia .
But they 're going to come back . Any major technique will go into the mainstream .
So last year , it 's been done again .
And that 's a way to do this for technology .
I want to talk about how to think about technology . I can call it a big unification for the future , but it 's more encouraging to predict the world 's future .
It 's based on assumptions that even if you look at all the important technologies , it 's all over four phases -- at least four steps , sometimes all four levels .
And every step of that can be seen as an accident , and once the slope of a matter of other things -- for example , a devastating increase in the world is changing technology and it 's a change .
This is the next chapter that tells you what this technology is and what you can do with it .
The first stage is <unk> .
The first observation is that it goes down to the end of the day .
And when it 's lower , if it is a successful technology , it will be more conservative .
There 's a lot of technology that 's going to happen in this period , and it 's another point .
And ultimately , it 's a lot of technology .
At the end of the lifespan , they almost become free of free .
And this , every stage provides opportunities for us . It 's a technological opportunity .
Even if you miss the first stage , like <unk> <unk> -- you know , <unk> - <unk> , and two two steps , but there are two levels of <unk> and it does n't go to free stage -- so there 's opportunity .
I think the story of the DVD is what I want to say , because this technology has gone all over the stage .
You know , the DVD is starting to go in the middle of the market , and it 's also a very expensive amount of money , but in 1998 , it 's worth 400 dollars per second .
And so it started <unk> , and you can see that the product is <unk> . This is a potential switch , which is moving forward .
And a year later , it goes into the next stage , and it 's a disaster . normally , 20 percent of the family 's worth of <unk> is a bad sign .
What 's interesting is that another one is another and <unk> device .
And all of a sudden you 've got the DVD of your house , and you have the high - speed video videos that you 're going to buy on the screen -- and you 've got to buy the reason that you have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> systems .
You also have the reason to connect and connect with other entertainment devices .
What 's interesting is that Netflix is born in 1999 .
Reed <unk> is here today , and he 's clearly seeing this moment , knowing that this is what he can do .
Next stage is to replace it .
You can see , in 2001 , it 's beyond <unk> .
From here , you can <unk> this in the world .
And so Netflix is true , and the combination of Netflix can not be able to do it with a video of a video .
One of the characteristics of <unk> is that it 's very small that you can put it in your letters .
This is something that provides a lot of work ; it 's not so obvious that it 's not so obvious .
And finally , the DVD station is almost close enough for free .
There 's a company called <unk> , a Chinese company , several times over the last few years in the past few decades , and last year , they 're 48 dollars per year .
You know , you 've probably heard about the price of the spray that 's really about a hundred dollars per barrel when you have a pair of <unk> .
But they 're really very cheap , and it turns out , when they become cheaper , migration , like <unk> , lose markets , <unk> the market .
And they 're <unk> , and this is what happens when things move on .
Now , let 's talk about four ways of looking at technology : four stages of technology .
I want to talk about some other technologies , and some of the technologies we 've been focused on , I 'm going to use this angle of view , the four steps to tell you about what 's going on .
They 're not necessarily the best ever ever before , they 're just in one stage .
But I think they 're going to get these twinkling <unk> , which is very <unk> .
So let 's start with gene sequencing .
And as you know , most of the genes are doing it in the computer , so prices are <unk> in terms of <unk> .
This is now possible -- it 's possible that it might be possible , if you 're going to get rid of it today , he 'll tell you about four million dollars a year .
And in a few years , it takes billions of years .
You know , we 've got increasingly <unk> tools to create <unk> tools .
What 's interesting is that the number of genes we 've found are growing .
Every gene has the potential for surgery .
And the first day , when tens of thousands of experiments can be done , if you 're interested in , you can understand your genes .
Here 's another technology that is close to unification .
A very surprising study of the World Health Organization shows the effects of HIV / AIDS - <unk> drugs and <unk> <unk> .
In January 2000 , it 's a million dollars per day , which is the 27th .
The first thing that <unk> <unk> was made from Brazil is the influence of the price .
It 's actually about 50 cents per day .
And the most interesting thing is , if you look at the price of multi - polar <unk> , you 're going to have a little amount of energy , and you can get a lot of money in the middle of the world , where Bill <unk> and the World Health Foundation , [ the ] [ ] ] <unk> <unk> : [ <unk> ] -- two millions of people who have been able to provide care for the last four million people .
There 's a huge amount of effect on this .
Linux is another example .
Now we 're going to tell you the opposite .
There 's a couple of technologies that are now going to be going to be coming up .
You see here , Linux is red , it goes 20 percent .
And interestingly , they used to be <unk> , but it was n't important .
What 's important is that the bottom line is <unk> .
But you can see these curves that you see 20 percent , it 's <unk> .
It does n't matter whether it 's a nice <unk> .
And I think that 's the problem for people who do n't have a problem in <unk> .
Another technology we have around us is integration .
I do n't know who you have in 2004 , and they 're really good .
You see the trend here : to 2008 , I think it 's not a crazy projection for the car sales .
Two percent is not 20 percent , but it 's a big development of the process , and it comes out .
And they 're going to get over two feet later , and they 're going to live in the way of the road .
And what 's interesting about gravity is people will send electric motors to the cars .
This is the first big change in the service industry in 10 years .
And then there are electric motors that you can do : You can change your car .
You can do <unk> , you can be able to do that , and you could do it with <unk> control -- from adding a new era .
You might have heard of <unk> <unk> online .
This is a bad thing to do , and it 's not very good at all .
The founder of <unk> <unk> came up with a company called <unk> .
If you look at numbers , they 're growing up in the last eight months , and now there are four million users . That 's the disaster .
Same thing is happening in <unk> .
You can see the <unk> standard standard standards , which is a <unk> , if you 're in here , that 's going to change the economy of this industry , speed , and player .
It seems a little bit like this .
And ultimately , free . Free free is really , really interesting .
<unk> is produced by free , because the cost of self - cost is basically free enough , free and personalization because it 's a very efficient strategy that has a lot of bandwidth .
You know , free is the gift of free Silicon Valley .
This is a economic force , a technology force .
If you look at it , it 's a <unk> force .
It 's not a railway station .
It 's about the most interesting thing about free .
This is a song you can store in a <unk> .
You know that it can be used to save the film , <unk> , and in 2008 , all the songs in the world could be stored in a value 400 dollars , so it 's going to be able to store the song .
You 've seen these figures .
I mean , the entire bear is <unk> , and we 're worried about Hollywood .
They 're facing an unprecedented stress .
And that 's what they 're perceived to do , but it does n't make the case .
And finally , I 'm going to give you a free example of free power , and I mentioned that <unk> : their <unk> will become free .
This is the price of the rise of India .
What 's interesting is that it 's the price of the ' 90s , which is the price of the last two years .
We have a similar telephone system .
It 's amazing that it 's <unk> creativity , but because of the fiber , they 're not going to develop , so you can see that price is very quick .
It 's usually about seven cents per hour .
And the amount of cheap <unk> , even freely , is the result of free telephone , which is <unk> computers , <unk> , <unk> .
This is probably the most dramatic shift in the world , and it 's the biggest economic tool we 've ever seen today .
India , China , and any other country in the country can share our market . communicate free to make them work with our companies -- this influence is just <unk> us .
And I think that this is probably the most important trend for us today .
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> : A plea for help
Obviously we 're in a moment of crisis .
And this is the fact that <unk> can make us smile , and the aid system is <unk> us , but I 'm standing on the side of the optimism room because the stakes are probably the most exciting moment of our life .
Because we 're talking about technology .
And because of the resources , and of course , of all sorts of people around the world , there 's a lot of other people who have developed the needs of change .
And we also have a president of the world , and knowing that the global world disappears without only one <unk> , but we need to use a new way of working with the world .
From one of the people in the room , everyone in this room is a <unk> , as a global citizen .
You 're all <unk> <unk> , and you 've seen the best and best of the human race .
Whether you 're working in that country , you have to see the limits of people to withstand control , even in the most normal people .
<unk> <unk> is a debate about how long it is to get people to save people from poverty , how to help them get their best .
One , some people think that help are <unk> , so we 're going to throw away .
On the other hand , there 's a priority that needs more license .
And what I want to talk about is something that is <unk> with something else .
I call it the patient capital .
<unk> said that since 1970 has spent six billion dollars in Africa , it 's just the <unk> of the environment , and is the incredible amount of poverty , which is because of <unk> ?
They 're doing the reason for <unk> .
And they 're using <unk> for the current policy , which is to increase government , to invest in capital markets , investment , but no aid .
On the other hand , as I say , some people are going to require more money .
They want to <unk> people to help population population , and give a huge amount of money , but for a lot of people who are willing to give them a little bit of aid .
They talked about the consequences of success : 700 percent of the population of smallpox , and tens of millions of dollars of malaria and <unk> infections .
The point is right .
But the problem about the question is that it 's all over the place .
And the problem with <unk> is that they 're not listening to poor people .
Over the course of 25 years of work , I know that , in this planet , it does n't have any impact on the effects of the planet than low population .
They have to drive the market every day , and the little decisions they 're going to be able to survive , to make them survive in society , but if a catastrophic health problem goes back , they get back to the poverty of poverty , sometimes even the influence .
So we all need market and aid .
And the patient is in the middle of the body , and they 're going to get the best thing to do .
It 's an idea of local entrepreneurs who are involved in trying to solve health care , <unk> resources , resources and energy methods , and ca n't think of money as charity , as the human fuselage , the consumer , their customer , who want to <unk> their own destiny .
By using this patient , we have the <unk> of <unk> , allowing local entrepreneurs to try to do enough of the research , to make the market as our best listening , and a huge amount of social impact , but huge social impacts .
It realized that markets have limits the limits in the market , so the price of capitalized is also to increase the budget of the global economy , including all people .
Now , three reasons that entrepreneurs need to raise these patients .
First , they tend to do it in the market where people spend a day and two or three or two , and they 're trying to figure out what 's going on .
Secondly , the foundation of the entrepreneur is <unk> . There are no roads , lack of power , and have a huge amount of experience .
And third , they often create markets .
Even if you 're the first ones to come up to the village , that 's the new thing .
And so many percent of people have already suffered a lot of <unk> , and experiences that have been done in many ways , <unk> <unk> and <unk> drugs , so they have to get their trust for a long period of time .
It also needs to depend on those consumers .
If we look at scale scale , we do n't just have to build a model that allows us to continue to connect with low - income industries , and other markets , government , companies , corporations , all sorts of things that make sense of honesty .
I want to share with you one thing about an innovation -- <unk> story .
In 2002 , I talked to a wonderful entrepreneur from India , who has been the most poorest group of farmers in the world .
And he said to me he 's about the federal aid aid to the market of the poor farmers who are , in India , there are two <unk> of farmers , and there are two million farmers , all the time .
The <unk> of their businesses are used to use <unk> , or directly for farmers , because they think that farmers need it , not farmers who want it .
At the same time , Daniel <unk> was working on the <unk> of Israel .
<unk> is a piece of water that will <unk> in the <unk> of the plants .
And you can see the <unk> desert as well .
But the market goes up to the cost of low - cost farmers , not because of the building system , because it 's because the system is for large land conditions .
And the small mountains in the village , the average continent , only two acres or less .
So Amy <unk> decided that he was going to <unk> this innovation , and it was designed to design a system for poor farmers , because he had been listening for a few years because of the <unk> of farmers who were listening to the farmer .
He uses three foundations to improve this invention .
First , <unk> .
A new <unk> system needs enough to <unk> farmers , just to use a quarter - acre , even if there are two acres , because the risk of <unk> is very low .
Secondly , his price requires extremely low .
That is that risk risk needs in a year , not , they 're not going to take this risks .
<unk> , Amy <unk> 's called infinity .
The <unk> of farmers could come up with the first quarter - acre of the ice , and the second three acres of land and third , the third , fourth ...
<unk> today , with all of the institutions of <unk> <unk> , for 30 farmers in the system , and it 's a system that can see that they 're more than twice the higher or three times higher than the Grand Canyon , but it 's not a day .
In fact , when you look at the beginning of the world , there are no personal investors willing to give the most <unk> markets in this world that are higher than 10,000 people in the day to replace this risks , which is the largest farming campaign in risk .
So he needed a license . He uses it to explore , trial , innovation , <unk> failures and <unk> .
And when he made models , it 's a lot more to learn how to sell it to farmers , and that 's where the patient is in the population of the patient .
And we 're going to depend on the financial company of <unk> , and start focused on marketing and <unk> and to use other investments .
Secondly , we can imagine whether we could <unk> the new <unk> system .
So we did <unk> <unk> with our Pakistan .
<unk> new technologies to the <unk> of India that needs time , and the same thing , <unk> to Pakistan , is just going to take a lot of <unk> , a few hours later , we 're able to have a company in Pakistan who 's in the most remote city of the Japanese Desert .
This company is just released , but we 're going to have a company that affects tens of thousands of people .
But <unk> systems are n't only developed by innovation .
We start seeing these things in the world .
In <unk> , in Tanzania , A <unk> to Z Foundation , the global foundation , and my organization , my organizations , are building 7,000 workers , mostly women .
They 've made hundreds of thousands of years of production for global Africans .
The <unk> hospital is the foundation of the <unk> Foundation and the Ministry of <unk> and <unk> , and a high - cost health hospital for low - performance health care hospitals , because it creates a hospital of every 35 days .
And " <unk> <unk> " decided to rebuild a completely sustainable industry , in Mumbai , to make sure that Google is using a Google Earth , so that everybody can use a <unk> , and it does n't have any <unk> service .
So what they did was they happened in the last November of Mumbai , in August of November , and because of collaboration , they were <unk> scale .
They had just signed the contract to <unk> contracts , to make them 100 new ones , and they become one of the largest capitalists of India .
This idea is very crucial .
Because we start seeing these companies that have thousands of people , and I 'm talking about the people who are at least two people .
But that 's certainly not enough .
And the idea of collaboration is really important .
It does n't matter whether it 's possible to interact with money in terms of private markets , or the government , there 's a lot of opportunity for innovation to innovation .
President Obama understood that .
And he 's starting to launch a social fund of social innovation to look at what 's going on in the U.S. and thinking about how to scale it .
And I propose that this is now building a global innovation that can find , not only the GDP of the developing world , and it makes a difference for the world .
This foundation is established not only to invest in money , but they need aid .
And then comes from the <unk> , and the lens of social effects .
When we think about new aid , we have to talk about Pakistan .
This country is not stable , from the state of fairness , in the U.S.
But I need to talk again about this moment now .
If we take this idea of " global innovation , " we can use this experience to invest in this period of time , not directly investing in government , even if we 've got the government of governments , it 's not going to make a difference to the international community , but a lot of social leaders in the country .
For example , <unk> <unk> . She 's founded the biggest <unk> bank of her <unk> , and she 's the real example of the women , or the country .
And <unk> <unk> , he founded a method called " The <unk> of the homeland , " which makes him <unk> .
There 's also a liberal arts in education , like <unk> and civic foundation in <unk> .
It does n't sound like these civil institutions and these social entrepreneurs who are working on the Taliban .
I 've been investing in about seven years to invest in Pakistan , and you 've got the people who are working on Pakistan that are very hard to work in women who are struggling .
The president of the president once said that the people who have been told to stop the experience of peace change .
And I want to say that this is true .
These are about 70 percent of the women who come up with more than two dollars per day for innovation and extending social leaders .
When we think about how to mobilize entrepreneurs in Pakistan , we need to have a lot of energy , and we 're also trying to think of it as a role to improve the role of the world .
When I came to the last time I visited the <unk> , I asked me to look at some <unk> handling systems that had already built in the garage .
We left <unk> at the morning morning .
It was about <unk> .
And we 've got the color of the <unk> of eight hours of <unk> in this area , and it 's very glamorous , but we 're rarely talking about it , because we 're all <unk> .
And finally , the point at the beginning , I can see a <unk> <unk> from a flat flat .
When we go into this , we 're more clear .
In the middle of the desert , there 's a quarter - year - old girl who 's in the desert .
And the reason for that is that one of the poorest farmers on Earth came to the technology that he needed to change his own destiny .
His name is <unk> , and he 's got a pair of <unk> and bright eyes , with a very warm <unk> .
And he said that this is the first time he 's in his life , and you do n't have to wear his son , 50 years of <unk> , five years old , for two days , to do a good commercial farm for five days .
And this is because of all of the crops he consumes .
And the money he offered him was that he did n't have to spread .
Since <unk> , dancers have had opportunities for schools to learn .
And we asked him that he would n't have my daughter and son .
And he said , " Of course , I will .
Because I do n't want to be <unk> . "
When we think about poverty , we ca n't reject the existence of individuals , but they still have basic dignity .
Because at the end of the day , dignity is much more dignity than the human spirit .
And so many of the entrepreneurial entrepreneurs in the world are in a lot of innovation , realizing that people need to be free , choices and opportunities .
Because those are dignity - sharing .
Martin Luther <unk> said , " <unk> love , love love . "
We 've seen this in the generation of two ways , but it 's always failed .
But I think that the generation , perhaps the first time , to <unk> love and power .
This is the global economic system that we 're looking for in our dreams , but also we have to have , and ultimately , it 's going to expand all the people on the planet .
This is a moment for us to start developing new ways of exploring new ideas , evolving through the realm of development .
I can only talk about my experience from my own experience , but at eight years of research , I 've seen the power of patient capital .
It does n't remind innovation and conservatives , but indeed , it creates millions of products and services that provided the system with millions and tens of thousands of people on this planet .
I know it works .
But I also have a lot of other sorts of innovation that are also effective .
So I asked you , whatever you 're working on , whether you work in the field , to start thinking about how we 're going to help people who want help .
Not that we think what they need .
I 'm going to use it to <unk> the world .
So let 's live in a lot of generosity and <unk> and purity .
But today , these qualities are the legacy of the human race .
But there 's also a lot of good things in the world when we 're going to go through the world .
Let 's think about the young people in the desert , the <unk> girl .
Thank you .

Yves <unk> on blog
And in the last few days , since I 've been trying to talk to you today , I think I 'm going to tell you how big it is to stand on this stage .
<unk> with Al Gore , and he plays with him in the president .
And I 'm more nervous , and I do n't tell you that Chris is going to sit underneath the stage , but also at the same time .
But I started thinking about my family .
I think of my dad and my grandfather , and I found that they called <unk> <unk> -- so I have to think about it .
And who is I ?
Chris alluded to me and my husband built a company .
We have about 30,000 employees across the world .
And if you look at the introduction of what you 're going to see , I 'm scared myself .
And I think it 's a <unk> slide , and I 've seen a little bit of cool talk yesterday about the chart yesterday , which I 've been doing .
This is my scientific slide here , which is the mathematical slide , and this is what science is , genetics .
This is my grandmother , my mouth come from her .
So I 'm a person who describes the blog , and maybe you have the understanding of the blog .
You might have heard of a <unk> event before <unk> , and that person talked about how to <unk> <unk> or how they 're going to use <unk> and how it <unk> the <unk> of <unk> -- and the company <unk> their <unk> to the public .
You might have heard of the <unk> of <unk> , because the creator realized that <unk> is not old ; it 's not the old ones , but using Microsoft software .
The blog is activated , or they 're trying to reveal things .
<unk> is terrible , and you might think that .
I think I 'm going to stand up here , and I have to say that the blog is really scary because there 's some blog .
But there are other reporters who change the way that we look at <unk> , and some of the blogs are very , very important .
And when you 're in the earthquake , people are able to write a blog on the <unk> of <unk> , and that 's what 's going to happen to the simple blog tool .
I have a friend of mine who had a blog that was a website called a <unk> digital website .
He just made enough money to raise his family 's family .
And he 's doing this right now , and that 's all the blog makers .
Or some institutions , like a <unk> .
This is a great organization that 's been made by doctors , and they 're going to get people who need to do it .
Those are the ones who have access to these stories , and that 's fantastic .
I did n't have my wife .
I talk about myself . I 'm a blog . This is me .
I always wanted to be a professional expert , and I 'd like to talk about myself .
So the simple thing is , I started writing blog in 2001 , when I was 23 years old .
I do n't feel happy about my work because I 'm a designer , but I do n't have any creativity .
When I went to college , I read my work , but I did my writing , and I wrote the blog .
This is the story of my 11 times when I was 11 years old , and I went to the end of the road , where the camp friends were hate , so I had no excuse to leave me with the <unk> .
And they were sharing makers , but I did n't hear anyone who said they wanted me to get me out of the window , and what was going on from the <unk> ?
You can laugh , no relationships .
That 's me .
This is my experience .
And when I start writing about the blog , I have a goal , and I 'm going to never forget , but I can try to figure out the web .
I came up with a goal . I said , I 'm going to have a prize because I have a prize in my life .
I 'm going to win this award to the Internet bloggers .
And sure , I won . I had a lot of money with the readers every day .
And I wrote something about <unk> .
And I wrote a blog about what I want to do with 300 dollars , and I 'm not going to play the instrument , I do n't know .
But I like music , I love <unk> , and I 'm probably familiar with Martin Martin who I think I am .
And I said to my husband , " Ben , yes ? " He : " No . "
So this is my husband , very shocking , <unk> , and he said , " You ca n't buy a <unk> .
You 're like your dad , just like the instruments . "
And I wrote a blog about him , and I 'm so <unk> that he 's so respectful and not buy it .
Everyone knows I was kidding .
And that 's what I like to do , and I love the joke .
Because this joke is that , in fact , this man does n't <unk> it , but there 's a lot of cute , and he even allows me to give him a letter and let me put these pictures .
And if he knew what I 'm showing you , he would kill me .
The problem is , I wrote a thing about this , and my friends read they thought , " That <unk> <unk> , <unk> . "
But I 've got people email to me , " Oh , my husband , your husband .
How much money do he have every year ?
You can buy money for him .
Why do n't you separate the bank account ? "
I was 17 years old , and I never had a bank account .
And they said , " Take your money in the bank account , you spend his money . That 's it . That 's it . "
And people say , " Talk to him . "
So I thought , well , who are they ?
Why do they have me blog ?
I realized , I do n't want to have a reader .
I do n't want to write things for the public .
I slowly slowly <unk> myself .
I do n't want to say <unk> , even though I 'm going to write the experience .
I wrote this , because Einstein .
My first sins , I think , was a little bit cry , she died two years ago .
I decided to break myself down , " I do n't want to write my life , because I think she 's going to die .
Whatever anyway anyway .
And these are my experiences . You read the politicians or the blog , or some <unk> , and so on .
But I 'm more interested in the experience , because I have people like this .
You often see the work of <unk> Rockwell , the art of art , which will say that <unk> is not art .
His work is <unk> in the living rooms , and it 's not a <unk> art .
But these non - <unk> things are most important to us .
These things cause us to think about the blog , if you think of the bloggers , those who are the ones who do n't think they 're in the world , the Bible , you think of normal things , that you 're going to think about something normal about the quality of the ordinary art ?
These normal stories , these people are just telling stories .
There 's a story about a baby called <unk> .
His dad is a blog .
He wrote his wife every day , and he 's pregnant about 25 <unk> of their kids .
And he never wanted to sit there .
One day , the day came to hell like hell .
And that 's the baby 's baby .
<unk> lives every day .
These are the photos of the day , and the first day , first day , day day .
And he <unk> , and he 's breathing 18 days of <unk> .
It 's a little bit of a baby that I 've never seen before , so that 's what makes people tick .
They 're reading what 's happening , 55 days old , the readers found that he 's breathing hard , and it 's hard to <unk> .
Then the situation started ticking . The 27 days , he went home .
You can see this blog .
This is not what you 're going to see in the newspapers or the magazine , and that 's what the blog is .
There are 28 comments , not a lot of people looking at it , but it 's been focused on attention .
Now he 's a healthy baby , and if you look at this blog , this baby 's father 's dad , <unk> his dad -- <unk> him , because this boy is the fact that his son is growing in his hospital , where he has a lot of treatments in the hospital .
So , the blog is so .
What 's the story ? You might probably hear something like this before .
People talk about a lot of different sorts of things that people talked about .
But I think the blog is basically a developed story of how we develop now .
It 's your personal record .
You can use Bob searches to understand who you are .
You 'll find some information , you do n't like it or not .
You 've also found the bloggers that people are writing about every day , not necessarily the same theme , but what they 're interested in .
We say the world is smaller , and I 'm very optimistic .
And every time I talk about blog , I 'm trying to communicate more .
There are hundreds of millions of people .
We want to connect with people in China , but there 's a lot of people who do n't have blogs .
It 's like 100 dollars a computer program , because it makes the blog very simple .
Our company is successful because it 's really easy to understand because of the <unk> , rather than anything .
So this is what we think .
So what 's important about the blog is really important to me .
And I showed you the slides in my family , and I did this because I knew I 'd show you this graph , my mother would see that she would say , " Why do n't I read that ? "
That 's what my mother is . These are people I know .
These are all my family , too , my home .
And I showed you the paintings of <unk> Rockwell , and this is what I grew up looking at .
I 'm going to spend a couple of hours looking at this relationship , and I said , " Oh , that kid in the middle is red <unk> , the first generation of <unk> . "
These are the things that are all about .
It 's not science , but I 'm interested in what I want to know about what we 're seeing , how we evolve .
This has been a profound impact on me .
I have a portrait of an organization who 's published in 1879 , which is my <unk> , and a lot of people are called <unk> .
This is information that is <unk> , and I have some information information .
And their birthday , their age , in their homes , are n't telling us so much . I only know how much it is .
And this is really interesting because I could barely get a lot of people out there , and I did n't even know what my mother was , because she was <unk> , I ca n't believe .
And I spent a lot of time , and I said , my husband is a conservative , one reason why I 'm going to show you the license of the <unk> -- and it 's all over the course of Washington . Now this data is already sitting on the Internet .
So there 's this data , which is my high speed .
This is the only photo I 've ever got to think about what we can do with a blogging computer , who can talk about the people who are using them , sharing their stories , how to share their story .
Another photo of mine , or a series of photos , is based on a project in Argentina and his wife .
And he had a shot of his family every day of nine years , and my daughter , my God , ' <unk> , " <unk> ' ? "
So here 's a little bit of a piece of math that you see here ? I 'm happy to get 100 percent because I 've only got 100 percent .
And you see these people who are age eight , and they look like this , or they can do it last year .
And I hope we can do that .
And if I have a child I know they will wonder , or my older career , the Jews tend to be wondering how they 're going to do something about what 's going on here , and I write the blog .
Since since last year , I took my toes every day , and I did it every day .
This is almost the same picture , and I did n't look at it .
Very few people see these pictures , and I 'm not doing it for audiences , but I 'll show you a little bit about it .
There are about four people who are concerned about them sometimes , and sometimes I say , you do n't show me , they 're going to tell me that , but the most amazing thing is , I can go back in the next four months and I remember what I was doing . He remembered .
This kind of vision allows us to know what 's going on every day .
I do n't have a lot of bad pictures .
And I remember : I had to do a journey in Germany .
And when I was in hotels , I did n't want to stay there . You 'll see it .
I 'm not going to die every day . Now I know how to laugh .
And if you look at my driver 's license , I have a <unk> that 's really important every day .
And the last story I want to say is that this story is probably the most profound story of what I 'm doing .
I might say that half of the time , because I 'm telling this story .
So there 's a woman who 's called <unk> , and she 's an blog , she is a blog of her services , <unk> us , we open our services and we 're doing it for the next 100 <unk> . She wrote how to fight cancer .
She wrote the blog , and we all read her blog because it 's very rare that we can read every blog .
She did this day , she did n't get a long day .
And her sister said that she 's going to die in her blog , and all of us are very , very sad .
This is an example of how it 's going to help me understand how many people in the blog are connected to people .
This woman lives in Britain , and she talked about her talk about what she 's doing .
It 's a sister who 's given us a lot of her sister , and she says to me that she 's in the last few months of life , a couple of months written on her blog , that might be the best thing she has ever experienced because you can talk to people .
How amazing that is that we make it possible to write a blog that makes a difference . We do n't always have the blogs , we have to do it very well , and we can talk to people .
How magic is this .
I print that , or I took her family 's <unk> portrait of her <unk> , and even in her disease , she talked about her blog , because the blog was a vital part of the fact that she had her life .
The blog is a big thing .
And this is one of the most wealth of her life , and I think that 's what economists think about , thinking about what you think you 're going to think of .
Thank you .

<unk> is the Grand Canyon of <unk> -- a <unk> , intense <unk> fish , and we 've only begun to understand what they 're doing , the ocean biologist , who has a lot of data to show that these amazing fish whales have never seen before .
mission blue , oceans , science , technology

Oscar <unk> : <unk> tuna in the deep sea
I 've been fascinated by the beauty of big meat , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> tuna are like us .
They are the largest tuna in the size of the sea .
They 're actually a <unk> -- they 're all used to the sun .
That was a <unk> whale in Monterey Bay .
You see the shape and the design of it that makes it bad in the ocean .
It 's going to be <unk> in the ocean , and it 's a lot more <unk> than it is on the sea .
In fact , most of the body is <unk> the skin , so it goes into the water .
This is one of the best machines .
<unk> tuna are also respected in the entire human history .
Over the last 40 years , we 've been able to do this in terms of sustainability , hundreds of thousands of years ago .
In France , <unk> tuna appear in caves .
They came up in 3,000 <unk> years earlier .
This fish is <unk> by human respect .
And all of the peoples of human beings are <unk> , except the generation of our generation .
<unk> tuna were covered with storms , and the Earth had been <unk> by <unk> tuna .
<unk> used to be sustainable .
And now , there 's a huge amount of money and community - funded community , and this is where you 're going to lose tuna from the Earth 's ecology .
The <unk> whale rate is in Japan .
Some of you may have predicted that they 're going to be extinct .
They are filled with meat , fat - <unk> meat .
But that 's the problem , we 're eating them .
Now in the Atlantic , stories are very simple .
And there are two groups of <unk> , two different areas .
And the <unk> is about 20 times a year in North America .
That 's what Europe is in Europe , the <unk> whale in the last 10 years , almost 50 percent reduction per year .
And the result is that if you have a number of times the amount of meat in the Grand Canyon , you 've got more than 90 percent of the size of a year in 1950 .
So , <unk> tuna gave talks to the tiger , and lions have some of the same things like <unk> .
Two months ago , these fish were suggested to be a list of endangered species .
But in two weeks , the advice of the voting was rejected , even two committee of <unk> , shown that the <unk> <unk> had a standard criteria .
Even if you 're <unk> for tuna , you might be going to be <unk> tuna and <unk> animals like <unk> , as long as the polar bear , the sharks , the <unk> .
These are the same things that are happening in the area of a whale in the same place .
Our challenge is that we do n't know anything about tuna , and all of these people recognize <unk> <unk> to prey .
But I 'm sure not all of you have ever seen tuna whales .
This tuna represents a general problem .
Now it 's 21 century , but we know about the oceans .
Technology brings us to a period of time : we can be able to look at space in space , and also to look at <unk> .
We have to use these technologies to make a more profound understanding of the ocean .
Most of us in the ocean , I 'm facing the oceans , and it 's a big one .
We do n't know structures .
You ca n't find out where there is a <unk> in Africa .
We do n't know what the ocean is , and we 're not sure what to do with tuna and conservatives .
And we 've only begun to understand how physics and the laws of physics interact with biology , so that creates a kind of <unk> - knit force .
It 's a huge challenge because technology says it 's hard to do .
We 're hard at the bottom of the <unk> tuna -- the entire Pacific research .
And the people who are really excited about it are <unk> it , and it 's much more difficult .
Now , imagine Bruce <unk> teams in <unk> , close to one blue whale , and it 's going to be able to say a mechanical problem that we still do n't have to actually get rid of this problem .
And we 're going to do this with the main <unk> of fish , and that 's the same thing .
We basically use components , or the components of your computer .
And we 're going to take this particular approach , which will bring us into a sea world .
Our first time to look at the action of tuna is not to measure <unk> and magnets .
I work with tuna for 15 years .
I was fortunate a member of the Republican Bay Area .
And we 're going to have a very small part of the glass , and we 'll show you <unk> tuna with <unk> whales .
When we fly on the top of the morning , we can see that water - to - peer openness is not a few places that allow you to see a huge amount of <unk> from your face .
We can see that they 're seeing it from their shape and their actions .
They 're in the <unk> .
We can see two million people per year , and they show them that they 're beautiful .
And in the late end , there was the laboratory of collaboration with the Stanford Bay Area .
From here , we 're going to <unk> and <unk> with tuna here .
We study these fish , but first we 're going to learn to feed them .
What do they want to eat ?
What do they like ?
We 're going to go into the <unk> of tuna . We do n't have the skin . That 's pretty good it !
And then , better , we 've found that our own coat <unk> , our <unk> and the Grand Canyon , can be able to put a big tuna in the sun , and so we can actually do it very much at the size of a surface , to learn not to harm the fish of the sea .
Two scientists and two scientists are placing a tuna in an oven - like style .
And that tuna would think it will be <unk> Japanese , but it 's actually gone .
We measure it for oxygen and energy consumption .
We 're going to document these numbers , and make better models .
When I look at tuna , I suddenly think that these fish are how they solve the problems of the problem .
So look carefully at it .
This is probably the nearest observation that can be done .
Now , the work in the laboratory has taught us how to get out of the ocean .
So in a <unk> called <unk> , we really came from the <unk> Canada , from <unk> to Spain .
We collaborated with many countries in the world , and we 're trying to put in the big tuna .
We 've tagged a thousand coat tuna .
And I 'm going to show you three short films , because I 've labeled one , 100 .
This process is like silent , but it 's beautiful .
We 've got tuna , measurements .
One of the groups that came out of <unk> , the team of scientists , scientists and the technicians to get it into four to five minutes .
We put it on it , giving it oxygen .
And then it 's going to make it work , and the computer can put it into a computer and it allows you to stay outside , allowing the computer to feel that the ocean can feel the sea .
And when it 's left , we 're always happy .
We can see the tail cloud .
From the data from us , when the fecal data goes back , we can get the reward for 1,000 dollars , and we 'll understand a <unk> in the most five year - old path .
Sometimes , a lot of tuna , like <unk> <unk> in the neighborhood .
But this is just half the size of our paintbrush .
It 's a group of people who need an effort to get it out of it .
In the image , what we need to do is to make a <unk> satellite that can <unk> into a tuna .
And the tag will be <unk> on it , and it 's going to leave the environment and then leave that fish into the water , which is the same amount of information that goes back in the water .
So from the tag there is information that you do n't have .
These are the two <unk> that are just going to be very expensive .
These tags are made by a lot of North American groups .
There 's the most sophisticated device that we have in the ocean .
A group of help to help us have more help than others .
That 's the <unk> gas organization .
There are two villages , <unk> and <unk> , and 10 years later , there 's a project called " <unk> <unk> . "
So here we 're talking about measuring this fish .
We 're going to do some things that we already start with .
You see the skin skin , you see my <unk> .
From that <unk> , we can get the gene . We can do some information with genes , and it 's going to jump back to the sea .
This is my favorite love .
In my <unk> , the help of <unk> <unk> in my cousin was a beautiful photo .
This is the second whale in the digital ocean .
Even when the Gulf broke , it goes down , and it 's cold .
This is the work of tuna , and it 's <unk> <unk> , but it ca n't go here .
But when that 's warm , the tuna are <unk> , and it 's going to go back to home . Maybe it goes back and down there and goes back to the original hill .
And then my favorite scenario , three tuna came back to Mexico .
Three <unk> of <unk> .
In space , we calculate them .
They 're coming together , they 're going to kill the next generation .
That 's where tuna is .
So , by the way , we can build maps of the maps in the map , and you can see hundreds of pieces of markers from these 15 years .
Now , let 's look at the <unk> .
So two <unk> . One is the ice that we tagged , and they go to the Gulf of Mexico , we can see it <unk> .
Europe is <unk> in Europe .
In two two <unk> of <unk> .
And what we 're going to do is to show a new model to the International Committee of the international singer , telling them that they 're wrong , and should n't be used by the meaning of <unk> .
This is an organ model that is <unk> .
So we can predict where it is .
And as a place like the Gulf of Mexico and the Grand Canyon , there was only one place in which there was only a tuna in the city .
This is obviously the place that should be protected .
And in the middle of the Atlantic , the whole place of integration can be able to allow the policy between Canada and United States , because they 're able to engage fishing . They 're very good .
But in the area of the cycle of land , the international sea area , we have to try and try .
This is possible to protect <unk> tuna .
Let 's look at the second project , called " <unk> the Pacific , " and we made a team .
And in <unk> , and the help of the <unk> Foundation , we 're going to have a project where we are 17 , which is now starting to launch a lot of waste fish to start with tuna .
We 've got a cow in <unk> , and it opened it up to the <unk> of it and follow them to <unk> when we 're going to put a <unk> on the front of the shark , where we can <unk> the sharks in the face of a shark . We 're very careful about this dog , which is <unk> by the moon and keep it <unk> and <unk> it .
Now , the satellites can be <unk> and can transform information to the moon .
This is a shark <unk> on the water , and if you look at it , you see the tentacles .
This is a shark that has the freedom to climb into <unk> , and the antennae is <unk> the data .
We 're not just documenting this one .
But it just shows that the color of the sea whale ice is much higher than the ice of the sea .
They come down from the <unk> to the Monterey .
Now in Monterey , there 's a research team in the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Foundation .
And they <unk> a plate of a <unk> <unk> , a curious curiosity , and he 's going to hit us with 16 feet long .
This is a million pounds animal .
We paste in paste .
We 're going to put a tag on a male tag , which is " <unk> <unk> , " or something else .
And then we put out the satellite tag onto the moon , send us a long - term tour of the <unk> , and this is based on the data that 's recorded by the light that comes from the cloud .
So the results of the <unk> can see two pieces of tags , and this is the temple in California , and then you go back to the end of the river .
We <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and whales and whales .
And now we can see that the amount of the temperature changes in the ocean , and we 're seeing the <unk> sharks and the ice that we see at the bottom .
And we saw <unk> and blues sharks .
<unk> , a whole sea - scale view of the ocean , tells us what to do .
In the <unk> of tuna , it 's been done by three groups of <unk> , 700 percent of the diameter of a 700 , <unk> whale , and <unk> tuna -- and we picked a couple of other coat coat <unk> -- we chose some young coat whales and put it into a black lining .
And when they go back , you can see them in the NASA Sea , and you 'll see that they 're going to see a tuna tuna in blue .
And the <unk> of <unk> <unk> is the glue that pushes them in their heads , when they fall apart .
Over half of the places in the ocean can see the data on the surface of underwater , 800 feet of data .
This is a portrait of a <unk> <unk> and a leopard <unk> , and they 're going to get 35 percent of the ocean from New Zealand to Monterey .
Our first success learned that they fly flying .
And the same thing with <unk> <unk> is going to travel across the ocean , and sometimes they 're flying into tuna .
You know why they 're arrested .
Now , here is a team of George <unk> and the <unk> teams that <unk> from the Grand Canyon , and I 'm going to show you a little portrait of the <unk> of the <unk> .
This is a group of data from <unk> <unk> , showing you <unk> <unk> , from Indonesia to Monterey .
We can see where the ocean is .
We can see the entire biosphere on the ocean .
From those information , we can start making a new map .
These are just three years of data that has been published in three years .
We can feel the state of the animal and the seasonal activity .
So what we can do is to use these streams of data , 40 units per million , a big task -- a place for 2,000 markers to tell us that we have a <unk> in California in California .
And then , like they 're giving us the <unk> of the device .
We collect data on the water in 2000 .
In the entire area of the Earth , the North Atlantic , the Arctic .
There 's a lot of ice that 's catching us up in the ice , and they 're going to send the amount of temperature between the ice and the volume of the sea .
This is a piece of data when it comes to the visualization .
We do n't want to be able to figure out how to work with these data .
And when these animals harbor information , these information are very important to the climate problem , and we also think that it 's important for the masses of people to be involved in the public .
We did this in big sea ice , and it brought four million laptops .
Now in Google , we can put <unk> in a ocean .
And he 's going to be able to get it inside that we know about sharks coming from California to Hawaii .
But maybe <unk> organization can be able to do places where we can not see .
We have this ability , NASA already has digital oceans .
We just <unk> them .
So , we know what <unk> is in North America : in <unk> .
We have technology .
And what we need to think about is how to launch the ability to record information .
How do we do these jobs in other places ?
And ultimately , it 's going to be able to get access to home , and you can get access to the <unk> of the whale .
If you want to , kill the software .
Most people are very excited when they look at the <unk> .
The iPhone will connect you with this event .
Here 's some images of the Internet .
So , we can do this .
We can do that .
We have technology .
Yes , we can .
We just need to use our technology to make a wider ocean .
Thank you .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> is an observation , and the local <unk> tells him that he 's going to die . He does a lot .
art , arts , data , safety , war , web
<unk>
<unk> : <unk> , I 'm here .
Hi , I 'm a <unk> ; I am a artist .
And usually when I introduce myself to it , they looked at me and said , " Are you painting ? "
Or " What are you doing in the media business ? "
Most of my work is to work with jobs rather than specific strategies or special technologies .
What I really interested in is <unk> problems .
I met a few years ago .
I 'll tell you a story .
That 's it .
This is April in the <unk> <unk> in 2002 .
I came back from an offshore <unk> .
When I came back , I had a <unk> leader , and I brought me into a small and a bunch of questions -- " Where do you go ? What 's going on ?
Why do you go there ? Who pays you ? ' " Yeah .
And then all of a sudden , I said , " Well , what do you do ? "
Most of us are asked , " Where are you in June ? "
Or to say , " I do n't remember , let 's look at it . "
And I took my <unk> , and I said , " Let me get nine . "
And it 's all about 10 to 10 , and I 'll leave you with a <unk> .
About 10 , 12 , met a graduate student .
She 's going to be at three o'clock in the afternoon , three to six , six to six .
" Oh , what do you do ? " " <unk> , 10 . "
" Do n't you ? Where do you sit ? " " Where 's the day ? "
" Ten of <unk> you ? "
We 've read about six months of <unk> .
And I found that he did n't recognize what I was doing .
I do n't feel like I did n't make a mistake .
And he asked me -- " That 's what you 're shooting at ? "
That 's when I was in <unk> , and I said , " In <unk> .
The furniture on the room .
That 's the <unk> <unk> because I 'm a <unk> . "
And he woke up watching me and said , " No <unk> ? "
And I said , " Of course , I do n't think I have no <unk> .
I 'm sure I 'll remember . "
And he 's a little bit suspicious , and I think anyone who 's going to tell me that I 'm not a terrorist .
We 're sitting there , and we 're going to get over about a hundred months and he says , " I 'm going to make enough information .
I 'm going to put the scar on the office , and that 's what they 're doing .
They 'll be <unk> , and we 're responsible . "
I said , " That 's good . "
So I went back to home , and I had a guy who talked to me .
And he was a <unk> in <unk> , and I had six months of <unk> in <unk> .
And you know what , in America , you ca n't get a picture of the federal center , but Google did it .
So thank you for Google .
There 's a lot of time breathing on this building .
And the answer is , " Have you ever had anything to do with anything that might hurt American or other countries ? "
And those are the questions that you have to think about .
Because what you 're faced with is someone who can determine it .
Or the question -- the problem with <unk> is they ask me about nine times -- one thing -- a ...
One is , " Your name is resurrection ? " " Yes . "
" Are we in <unk> ? " " Yeah . " ' It 's Tuesday . ' "
It 's because you make decisions .
And then , of course , is , " Are you going to lose the U.S. government ? "
I teach in university .
I said , " You might have asked me directly . "
And they said , " Okay , do n't we be talking about whether you 're going to be a <unk> organization ? "
And I said no .
After six months of <unk> , they say , " There 's no problem . "
I said , " Yeah , that 's exactly what I 've told you .
I know everything . "
They looked at me .
I said , " I 'm traveling . "
And this is what I said to you .
And I thought , " Just just try to figure it out in the country , it 's not going to happen again . "
This is what I really worried .
And he said , " You 've got to have a problem , give me the telephone -- we 'll do it . "
And then I 'm going to tell you what I call the <unk> .
And I told them , " Hey , I 'm going to go . That 's my flight .
In <unk> , 12 <unk> went to Seattle .
And I 'll tell you a few weeks later .
Not that I was forced to do it , but I chose that .
It 's just telling them .
" What do I do ? "
" I do n't want you to think of you .
They just want you to know .
So I kept doing it .
And then the telephone becomes a email , and the letters are more mature ...
There are also groups associated with <unk> .
And then I did a website .
<unk> a website , let 's look at this .
I was designed in 2003 .
They can track my particular moment .
And I wrote this code called mobile phones .
I decided , you do n't want to look at me , okay ?
I look at me . I 'm looking at me .
You 're not going to have a <unk> .
I do n't help you .
So in this process , I started thinking about what I mean ?
They should know my flight record , and I decided to put all the planes out of the way .
You see , <unk> <unk> from <unk> to Atlanta .
This is my dinner card on the plane .
This is from <unk> <unk> to San Francisco .
Look , they 're not going to take you out of the airplane , but they give you this airplane .
This is some of the ice that I went to , because I loved the airport .
This is <unk> <unk> , 19 , November , 15th .
This is a storm .
Singapore , you see these places .
This is a picture of all the photos .
But if you look at other data , it allows you to <unk> these information as well as possible .
When you have to prove that every two weeks , you 're in a completely different age of life .
When you look at this , the art project thinks " Art project . "
It 's not saying , " Aw , I have new jobs . "
But it 's all about the experience .
<unk> all of the details that come together , the way that self - discovery is really become this project .
These are some of the shops that I 've ever been traveling because they need to know about this .
This is my mother 's <unk> , and this is the 99 <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> .
In a South African <unk> , they bought <unk> because I loved it .
And I 've also bought some crabs there in the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> spray on the <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> , 18 <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
If you look at my bank , I 'm going to show you these five - year - old gallons of oil , and I 've got a hundred million dollars from <unk> .
But I did n't want information , but I joined the third third grade , my bank , and it was given to me , so I 'm here .
These are pieces of <unk> .
And there were Yves <unk> .
Sometimes it was very <unk> .
That 's the cost of <unk> .
This is all from every single one of my shelves from my <unk> .
Sometimes it 's a lot of information .
This is the old apartments in San Francisco .
Sometimes this is this .
Sometimes it was about a <unk> , and it was 22 months of <unk> .
And I 'm going to talk to you about the people , because I 'm going to do this .
And I have to tell them every detail .
I spend a lot of time .
This is a parking - eight - year - old village for eight months in the late 1960s .
And there 's a lot of time in <unk> -- on top of the <unk> .
So there 's a whole bunch of database .
There are thousands of photos .
There 's a couple of photos on this website , and I 've seen the whole picture of all the photos -- at least I believe they 've seen it .
Sometimes you do n't have a <unk> .
And sometimes a lot of these texts , but not the photos .
Sometimes this is this .
This is my favorite sandwich in the West , Vietnam : Vietnam .
These are different types of <unk> that are filled with <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> .
These are the ones that I 've done .
How do you know that 's home ?
Because this <unk> <unk> is a lot of times .
You 've got to work for your work .
Sometimes this data is very specific .
These are the steps that I 've eaten in the <unk> , and I 'm going to get out of the 18 days of a <unk> <unk> .
George Dyson in <unk> .
So the afternoon was completed for this one afternoon , 4 a.m.
And I was documenting my life every second .
And I just shot the photo every day .
These are the ones who take the iPhone directly to my servers and <unk> it .
They 're going to know what I 'm doing because they want to know .
I went there in April of April .
In June 2009 , June <unk> , in the <unk> afternoon , my apartment was there .
You can see the <unk> information here .
If you go to my website , it 's a lot of information .
And this is n't a user interface .
You can say the users do n't .
One of the reasons why one is to use <unk> is that everything you have to rethink .
And I put all the information that I told you about it .
But despite all this completely openness to me , I still have <unk> life .
You know my very rarely .
And so I came up with this idea of protecting you <unk> , and it 's been published in the era of the time that you 're published .
How do you do it with all the information ?
You have to control it .
If I just give you information , it 's a very different approach to information .
Here 's another interesting thing about the Greek -- that 's who they are not -- they 're going to work on information as product , or information .
And their information is valuable because other people do n't get it .
When I get rid of the <unk> , it brings information to you , and it 's going to give you the information that you 're going to get out of it .
This is the opposite of the individual , and it 's a <unk> .
But if you have 300 million Americans .
And that 's exactly what we 're going to do .
Because if everybody shares information , it becomes paralyzed .
And we 're approaching that .
When I started this project , people looked at me and said , " Why do you want to know what you 're doing ? "
" Are you going to keep the photo out ? "
And it 's people who do n't start using <unk> , now , by the way , <unk> billion people in the developing world .
In some sense , I 'm happy to be totally <unk> .
And I 'm doing this project , but it 's completely irrelevant because you 're all doing it .
This is what we 're doing every day , even though we do n't realize it .
We 're creating our <unk> .
Some of my friends , " Are you too aggressive , <unk> ?
Because nobody is looking at you .
Nobody cares . "
One thing I did was to focus on hoops of servers to look at <unk> <unk> .
Because this is the view .
And I have to look at who 's looking at me looking at me .
And I found that .
These are some samples .
Just just that , you can see something .
I 'll tell you a little bit about it .
You can see that land <unk> like <unk> , the land is moving .
There 's also National <unk> , and there 's the country .
I actually moved to the place where they 're very close to them , and I 'm going to live with them .
And <unk> was born .
President 's German offices .
You do n't understand what they ask , but they come up .
I think they might like art .
It 's really happy that we have the <unk> of this field .
Thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : <unk> , I 'm curious .
You say , " It 's all <unk> from my iPhone , but how do you make it ?
How many times a day ?
<unk> : Very rarely .
It does n't make any difference .
I tell you what to say .
We do n't want to do that before .
So this is the same thing .
We do n't think how long it is when we attract .
So the basic thing is , I 've got a little <unk> in my cellphone , okay , okay .
It 's all about <unk> .
BG : If you 're not able to get rid of the region , it will cheat ?
<unk> : Well , that 's the end of the end .
You know the last place .
If I have a flight flight , you can see the last <unk> I left .
BG : <unk> , thank you very much .
<unk>
<unk> tells us a huge amount of social social differences , which is a problem . Richard <unk> uses a series of data on the table of the economy , and the problem is that the problems of health , the <unk> , our social , productivity , even the basic values .
culture , data , global issues , money , social change , visualizations
<unk>
Richard <unk> : How the economy does n't <unk> society
You should always know what I 'm going to tell you .
I do n't think that <unk> can be able to attract social and <unk> that before the French Revolution .
What 's different about this is that we can find evidence that the evidence is , in contrast , the increase in social societies , <unk> , to understand the effects of uncertainty .
I 'm going to show you some data and explain why the data is connected .
But first , look at our lives .
I want to start with a <unk> .
This image shows that our lives are almost the same amount of relationship between the National Development <unk> .
And you can see those countries on the right , like Norway and America , their richest level of the Israeli , the French , the Portugal .
But it does n't have to affect their lives .
There 's no relationship between each other .
But if we go to the inside of society , we find that there 's a lot of health variation in them .
This is still a picture of life .
These are the town and the Arctic , the <unk> town -- the one on the right .
There 's a huge difference between poor people .
Even the people who are sitting below the top , their health are more expensive than people .
So income is very , very strong in our society , but in different social societies .
And that <unk> explanation is that in our society , what we 're seeing here is relatively relative or social , social and identity -- that 's the same relationship between us .
Once you have the idea , you should think about it immediately : What if it happens ? What about productivity or growth ?
That 's what I 'm going to tell you about .
I do n't use any hypothetical data .
And my data is from the United Nations -- and the data in the World Bank -- is about the same amount of democracy in the U.S. government .
And the way we use it , simplicity , and you can download , is 20 percent of the GDP per country .
And you can see that the countries in the left are equal -- Japanese and Finland , Indonesia , Sweden -- they 're about 20 percent of the population of 20 to four times per year .
But the other side of the <unk> -- England , Portugal , the United States , Singapore , goes larger .
In this way , we 're not equal at the same level of democracy , twice as much as possible .
And then I 'll show you what the implications of our societies are .
The problem for social diversity is that we collect data , and this problem is more common in the middle of society .
The data in the international world include the math and the mathematics of childhood , kids , infant mortality , death rates , the rates of <unk> and women , <unk> , obesity , diabetes , loss -- these symptoms , all the <unk> -- and social <unk> .
We put all these things into a <unk> .
They 're all submerged .
One of the founders of this country is that these are the ones who get these traits .
And you can see that these are the ones that I 've showed you , and I 'm going to show you a little bit more <unk> .
The more <unk> country is <unk> in all social problems .
<unk> is very powerful .
But if you look at the same health and social issues associated with <unk> , you do n't see what you 're going to see .
We have a little worried that people might think we were chosen to choose a specific problem with our theories , and then the evidence of human - sharing evidence is that we 're working on a magazine of Medicine .
It has 40 different parts of it , from others .
It has kids who talk to the parents , if you have a book in the house , and how much of the school , or whether it 's in school , or whether it 's in school .
All of it comes out .
That 's the relationship between <unk> and <unk> .
The more <unk> societies are not equal in social societies .
<unk> and <unk> .
But again , if you look at the relationship between kids and <unk> , you 're going to do nothing . There is no connection .
All of the data that I showed you today is the same thing .
The average quality of society is not going to depend on <unk> and economic growth .
They 're very important in poorer countries , but it 's not true for rich countries .
And the difference between us is very important in the position of others .
And then I 'm going to show you some of these <unk> .
This is <unk> .
It means that most people are <unk> .
This is data from the world 's values .
And you can see , in the other side , about 15 percent of people feel that they trust others .
But in more <unk> societies , it goes down to 60 or <unk> .
And if you look at <unk> , or social progress , there are very similar relationships associated with <unk> and non - conflict .
And I said , we 've got twice the job .
And what 's the first thing to do with these rich countries , and then we <unk> testing the testing of the United States over 50 years later -- the same question : Is that the more <unk> state in all of these <unk> , the better state for all these predictions ?
This is the <unk> associated with the federal government in a normal society .
And this is very similar to the equivalent of the same kind of trust .
Same thing .
And basically what we found was that almost all of the things that were embedded in the international surveyed associated with <unk> , 50 percent of them were in our research .
That 's not a coincidence .
This image is <unk> .
And the way the World Health Organization uses the same way to <unk> data is to gather the data that allows us to be able to do something about social <unk> .
This is the ratio of a million people who have no <unk> population .
It 's from eight times the size of the <unk> -- which suggests that the whole society has three times as many values .
Similarly , these are connected to <unk> .
This image is Hitler .
The red dot shows the American <unk> , the blue , the blue line .
But look at their differences .
The murder rate from every million 15 launches .
This is the ratio of <unk> Mother .
It 's 10 times higher than the 10 .
But the <unk> of <unk> came from 40 to 400 to 400 .
<unk> is not the main reason for this relationship .
In some places , the crime can explain one reason .
But even more noble <unk> , or more <unk> <unk> .
The more social it is , the more it becomes more <unk> .
This is a picture of kids in high school .
That 's a lot of difference .
And if we talk about social personnel , it 's very intimidating .
This graph is social <unk> .
It 's actually based based on income - based computing calculations .
And basically , what is it that <unk> the dad in the council of the <unk> , or whether it does n't matter any relationship ?
In the other side of <unk> , the revenues are more important -- for example , Britain or American .
In Europe , the revenues are not so important .
There are more <unk> gas .
As we say -- I know there 's a lot of American audiences -- if Americans want to do their American dream , they should go to Denmark .
I 've been showing you here in <unk> .
I can also show you some other questions .
And those are the ones that are more pervasive and more pervasive .
But social resources are infinite problems , and these problems seem bad -- not just a little bit bad , but nothing about two times more .
Think about cost , cost cost .
And I want to go back to this image of this before , and we 've gathered all of these together to say two things .
First , through a piece of chart , we found that those who were silenced , whether it 's more non - <unk> , it seems to be more neutral , but they 're all about Europe and Japanese .
So what we 're seeing here is the same relationship between social diseases and non - <unk> .
Not only a couple of questions , but almost everything .
And one of the most important things that I want to point out here is , if you look at the bottom , Switzerland and Japanese , they publish them very differently .
Women of women in the women , in wealthy countries , are in both <unk> .
But another important difference is that they 're going to do a lot of resistance .
There 's a lot of variation in the income , but it 's in taxes , the health care , and the state - state , generosity , <unk> , etc .
Japan is very different .
First of all , Japan has a little <unk> .
It 's much lower .
It 's more powerful than it is .
In the United States , we found the contrast to the U.S.
There are state effects associated by <unk> , and there are some states that contain good things because of the income .
So what we concluded about how to do a big change is not important , and importantly , it 's important to achieve this dynamic .
I 'm not saying that it 's all about <unk> , and I say , well , it 's all about a wealthy market .
The other thing about this painting is that it 's not just the effects of the poor ; it 's not <unk> .
John <unk> seems a little bit wrong : " Nobody is a vegetarian . "
In a series of studies , we can be able to compare each individual of every single individual , or a different country .
This is just an example .
This represents baby mortality .
And according to the <unk> of the U.K. economy , some of them are very glamorous , so many babies die .
This is an <unk> based on his father 's father , so that Mum <unk> a bunch of data .
But we look at what 's called " social <unk> , " which does n't require technology .
On the middle , the skill of technology is going to work , to the high - skill jobs , constantly <unk> jobs -- doctors , lawyers , large businesses .
And here you can see that Sweden is working better than Britain , in every common society .
The biggest difference arises in social base .
But even in the top , life has some advantage in a very strong society .
We 've seen five groups of data , including the American and international education results and the health .
It seems to be a little bit more anti - <unk> , which is the most obvious thing about the difference between the bottom of the Earth , but in the upper top of the society .
I 'll explain it to you .
I think I 'm going to show you that I am showing you non - cultural effects .
More of the attention is to focus on <unk> and <unk> , being respected and respected .
And of course , the feeling of the competition of identity is <unk> by social modification movements .
But it also also makes sense of <unk> .
We 're more worried about how other people judge and look at us , whether we have <unk> and smart , or whatever .
Social value to social values is to look at the fear of values .
Interestingly enough , there are some kind of jobs that are working in the same way : Some people come up with a different study of different studies ; the volunteers are invited to a psychological trial , and testing their pressure and test their stress task and they <unk> their wrist .
In this observation , scientists are interested in what stress is , the most important <unk> of the body , most importantly , <unk> levels .
And the result is that the mission of social relations is the task of <unk> , threats to <unk> and social status -- these missions can <unk> your performance .
These pressure has very special effects on stress .
Now we 've got <unk> now .
And of course , some people do n't like this , and somebody found this very surprising .
But I should tell you that when people celebrate data , we never did it .
We have a <unk> rules , if our data is looking at the data in the country , then we 're going to figure it out .
Our data can determine whether the data works , not us .
Otherwise it will happen .
What else else ?
In conjunction with <unk> censorship , 200 research research is about health and income .
This is not the case that these countries have a very simple illustration .
Same country , equally equal , a problem .
Why do n't we control other things ?
I 've shown you that <unk> <unk> did n't have any influence .
And of course , some people used to use more complex ways in the literature , to bring poverty , education , values .
How ?
It does n't make a difference .
We spent a lot of time .
Indeed , people have a good understanding of our outcome .
The biggest change in the population of rich countries , the <unk> of the world , is from social pressure , and how important it is for the environmental system , and how important it is .
Or for example , violence has become more common , because they 're very sensitive because people are sensitive to themselves .
I 'm going to say , for dealing with this problem , we should solve a range of problems and <unk> .
We should limit revenues , <unk> percent of the top , <unk> culture .
I think we have to get our leaders for our commitment .
And the final thing I want to finish with is that we can continue to increase the quality of our income in our income .
So , we 've found that suddenly we have a social social health problem , which is really fantastic .
Thank you .

<unk> Smith once wrote a year in prison , and what he 's seeing is fundamentally different -- in the <unk> , he saw the harm of wisdom and conservatives -- and he proposed this question : Why do n't we do this ?
business , prison
<unk>
<unk> Smith : The business lessons in the prison
And so , in many cases , B has a big plan for <unk> .
His wish is to kill his two <unk> , and he 's trying to <unk> his 250 participants into a business .
And he came up with a dollar - to - a - half dollar content website for the <unk> website , and it 's on the top of the day .
And I was just a week in the federal prison for week , but I realized that there was no difference between it .
In fact , the prison is filled with smart , <unk> , six months ago , as the founder of " <unk> " , " and I 'm going to leave you with the CEO of the old war , and then I feel that the business of a war is <unk> and high .
All of my grandfathers are arrested because they 're going to use their past , but they talk about a whole bunch of things that they 've talked about , and they say , " Well , the lessons of business and business lessons -- the <unk> of motivation , <unk> , new customer - <unk> <unk> -- the market can expand the whole consumer population .
They did n't <unk> in the past the last year .
And most of that , they 're still trying to survive .
It 's probably more difficult than you think .
<unk> , unlike most of the people in the world , are <unk> prisoners in prison . You have to nurture yourself .
You have to pay <unk> <unk> , paintings , air , <unk> and so on .
There 's a couple of reasons why to survive in prison .
First of all , the price is 30 to 50 , and second , you spend money on money .
I was doing golf balls for trucks . This is a full - time job in a food <unk> for a month , not a hour .
How do you live ?
We have to <unk> , all kinds of business .
There is a legal scientist .
Buy things to tomato paste .
Giving <unk> for <unk> .
There 's also a little bit of business for <unk> , like in your body .
The <unk> <unk> is a little bit more serious .
There 's also a big deal of police , very serious marketing : from outside the outside , or <unk> , and the <unk> of the drugs , the same commercial world in the world , as well as the business of their own businesses , so that the higher risk of commercial risks will be higher .
Do you want to buy a bag in prison for three or five dollars .
And I want to think of it as big as the human brain ? 300 dollars .
<unk> ?
That would cost 1,000 dollars .
You might have found that flexible brain is very important in prison .
Whether it comes from the <unk> of <unk> , it 's used to do it with a leopard or a <unk> in the rock , and she 's going to have a lot of people who know how to survive on the bottom of the tree and see how many people are able to live in a way that you can get to the prison and <unk> it in an <unk> .
But none of the students in the prison help go to the community of societies who do n't really have a real <unk> in prison , but nobody helps to write business plans , and to help them find the way that they 're going to be able to get out of an <unk> business program , the way , in the world , that the prisoners are even unable to do it .
And then , in the end , a lot of the state - <unk> laws are not <unk> the laws of <unk> .
So in the two thirds of the state of two - thirds , the truth is that we did n't have to be surprised .
I lying lying in the federal government , so it was a year in the federal prison .
But , in the end , I swear to my prayers to the people who had the same experience with me , and people had to do something that would not keep saving lives .
So I want you to think about it .
Our best choice is to be able to protect the <unk> of the prison to the prisoner 's <unk> , because if we do n't do that , the prisoners ca n't learn to get them to help them .
And they 're able to learn what 's going on in prison .
Thank you .

<unk> Jacques legislature is <unk> in his talk , <unk> <unk> , which is the design of a lot of fun , to come up with beautiful , interesting , pleasure and emotional , and so on , he talked about three emotional reviews that all the <unk> needs to work .
creativity , design , happiness

Don <unk> : A 3 ways to design happiness
And what I 'm concerned about is beauty .
People are going to say that Norman 's equations are good , but if you 're speaking with him , you can do it .
But I do n't mean that .
I look at this stuff .
And I 'm going to tell you a little bit about it here .
I want to say something beautiful .
And I was completely concerned about what it was that it would be , but I wanted it .
This is my new life .
My whole life is participating in how beauty and <unk> are .
The core of my new life is to create beautiful and fun things .
This is <unk> <unk> , <unk> by <unk> .
It 's really fun to do that , and I have one of my family 's homes , but I 'm going to put it on top of it .
You know , I 've got one of the things that I bought with <unk> <unk> , and I saw a <unk> that did n't work on this machine .
Because it 's because of the <unk> of <unk> .
So I put my <unk> on this machine , and then I <unk> this photo .
You 'll see that there 's a shot there .
That 's the latter of a Japanese company .
Here 's how beautiful it is .
And the second thing is that the knife is <unk> , it 's a very nice operation .
And the bottom line is very sharp , very uniform .
It makes sense to be very uneasy .
Is n't that true ?
It really is beautiful and very useful .
I can also tell you a couple of stories about the theme , and you know I have a theory about emotion .
This is the <unk> of the theory .
And the <unk> and his colleagues in MIT did this same thing in the MIT Media Lab , and they found a piece of paper and on top of a projection with a water that had coat water on a <unk> .
You 're going to get out of the front line , and you have a <unk> fish that goes down to the rest of the day .
And then she jumps to another place and again , look at that fish .
Is this a good way to play candy ?
No , do n't you ?
That 's fun .
Look at Google .
If you <unk> " emotion design , " you get a <unk> .
And Google is very <unk> , and it 's a very glamorous portrait .
It 's not telling you that you have <unk> , <unk> results .
This is the head 20 , which allows you to see a lot of <unk> , and every <unk> represents a page .
Very simple and very glamorous design .
And I think many of you have seen it , but it does n't have any attention .
This is the feedback engine for the unconscious , looking at this thing and feel happy , but you do n't know why .
It was really amazing .
And the most interesting thing is that when you look at the design of design and emotion , my website is the first one .
But Google would <unk> , because if I had the design of design and emotion , it would tell me that you do n't need to <unk> .
Okay .
And so I went to design that emotion , and my website was no longer the first one .
It 's the third year .
Okay , another story .
And the New York Times had a commentary about a <unk> car .
It says that this is a <unk> car .
But you can buy it .
Because <unk> feels great .
And if you look at the inside of the car , I 'd like to see a little bit about it , which is when my son is license , and I 've taken pictures of the interior , which is <unk> .
It 's very <unk> .
<unk> is very good .
This is my new life for fun .
I really think it 's always going to go together , but I ca n't understand why until ...
So I 'm going to take a bag on the floor .
Suppose I have a two - foot - old coat <unk> , and I could n't wait for me to go on the top of the glass ceiling .
No problem .
And if I put this up , I wo n't go into it .
<unk> will make people smile .
And it changes the pattern of brain work .
And Paul <unk> says that his talk was very nervous at the end of the talk , until the last couple of weeks , and even a few hours to <unk> , but the anxiety of intense anxiety is to help him focus with his focus .
<unk> versus anxious , it 's also that they 're able to focus their attention , rather than <unk> , but usually the first principle of <unk> principle .
But I could n't do it .
But some people can do something like Microsoft <unk> .
These two emotions can change your problem .
This is an interesting experiment called <unk> <unk> .
She finds a couple of classes .
You bring them out of room rooms , and they have <unk> , and there 's <unk> <unk> .
That 's a piece of <unk> , only one table of the table , and there 's some <unk> scissors and other things .
She took her student into the room , and she said that this is a IQ cop that can test you in real life .
Can you <unk> that rope ?
And on the back of the student , this rope over the other hand , and there 's another rope , another rope , and they 're going to get off .
It 's really <unk> .
It turns out that there 's no mission to do .
And the other thing about this psychologist is to say that we 're starting to tell you what I have here , and I 'm going to leave you with a leopard sugar , but I ca n't do sugar .
How do you eat ?
The students are very happy , and maybe it 's not really good enough to make them feel good at least .
And they do that .
And when you 're in a panic state , your brain is accelerating , and you are going to be more likely to focus on the atmosphere and make you think of it .
And when you feel happy , you 're going to get more dopamine out of the brain , and you 've got to be <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , where you are more likely to think of it .
That 's essentially the nature of the brain .
Every time you feel a happy storm , you 're going to be <unk> and nobody is <unk> your idea , and all sorts of <unk> ideas come out .
But if you look at anything like this , you do n't have to do it , because you will suddenly say , " Yeah , I can use a new approach to new ways . "
So it needs to work for work , and you need a professional .
You have to have a sense of optimism .
A different way of working on the brain , when you 're happy , you become more creative .
And the problem is you 're going to figure out how to fix it .
There is no big deal .
One is the <unk> of the senses .
So the results of biology are very <unk> that our people love <unk> color .
<unk> animals and primates love fruit , <unk> plants , you eat fruit . You have to spread seeds .
The brain is developed by evolution .
We do n't like the noise that noise does n't sound like noise or fall .
It does n't sound like the face of <unk> , but we love <unk> faces .
These are emotional emotions .
In the design of design , you can do this kind of emotion in different ways .
If you look at the <unk> car in <unk> , <unk> is a very old car , but it 's a lot of bad news .
It 's beautiful , it 's covered in New York Museum .
This is a <unk> , you buy it because it 's a very primitive water .
They 're not going to throw it inside .
And they 're going to be able to do it in the <unk> , or <unk> the water , and it says not water .
This is the experience of <unk> .
And the second is that most of the things we have in our lives are made out of this .
The perception is the unconscious , you do n't know what it is .
And you ca n't feel that .
All of the things we do are the unconscious .
I did n't get my legs on the stage , and I did n't have my feet .
I was talking about most of the time , and I had a lot of preparation to think about it .
Most of the things we do is the unconscious .
<unk> behavior , because it 's all about behavioral control .
And the fundamental nature of behavioral design is that it 's going to have to do something about the user , including the <unk> , to understand how much it is and the weight is associated with weight .
The Bible is very glamorous .
It 's very uniform that you feel everything you 're doing .
Or it 's a very nice car swimming across a <unk> , and you feel everything you can feel in your own control .
Or it 's a physical emotion .
And this is a <unk> head , a waterfall on the bottom , and these are the ones that are very small .
And it can be <unk> in any direction you have a few hours to stand up there and do n't waste water , and it 's going to make water that keeps the water cycle .
And this is a very glamorous piece of teapot , and I was there in Chicago , <unk> hotels .
It 's a <unk> Ford - <unk> cap .
I do n't have the difference on the surface of the <unk> , but when you 're going to get rid of it , you need to throw it down in the window and put it in the water water .
So let 's put it on the sandwich .
And so the cow will get into the <unk> on the side of the <unk> .
There 's a <unk> cow , and it 's moving in this place and slowly slowly recovers .
There 's been a little bit better or better , and you 're going to put your nodes in little <unk> .
It does n't have to be covered by cow , and they 're going to keep it .
Once it 's good , you 're going to get rid of the teapot , and you want to remember the sandwich that 's in this place , only to the place .
And the <unk> nodes are also doing a communication , and it 's also very emotional .
emotion performance on behavior .
That 's the safe feeling .
The meaning of cognitive understanding is to understand the world , to try to explain this world of beauty and danger , which is that we 're going to do the work of muscle .
We can tell people the emotions of the others because we can see their muscle in action , even though it 's only in the unconscious , but our face is particularly good at <unk> .
And the teapot is emotional because it 's going to make a signal , " Look , Nashville . "
And the man would come and say , " Do n't you need a better water . "
This is a really clever design that 's really a good design .
And the third level of <unk> is <unk> <unk> , which is a part of the brain , and it 's a brain that ca n't control your senses .
It 's only a <unk> .
And it 's the little sound that you have in your brain , and it says , " This is something good . "
Or " Why do you do that ? I ca n't understand it . "
That 's what consciousness is .
This is a <unk> product .
Yves <unk> once said , " I 've had a lot of car - driven cars , but never have a car , so I have never seen my own consciousness .
This is about their images , not the car itself .
Even if you have a more positive example , this is a <unk> car .
If you decide that the only explanation for that car is you 're very concerned about the environment .
It 's a hard effort to buy a sustainable effort , even if the first <unk> will be <unk> and not full of <unk> .
But that 's what design is designed .
Or it 's a very expensive watch , and you can say , " Well , they 're going to be in front of his friends , you know , I do n't know how you have a seat . "
And this is the <unk> of a pure <unk> , and it 's possible that it might be <unk> than that before .
But it 's <unk> .
This is one of the founders of <unk> <unk> , watching it .
When you get a emotional <unk> , it 's more fun when you feel more interesting , and you 're afraid , <unk> flakes , you 'll get the word , " This is safe , you 're <unk> . "
If you look at the cable device , it 's <unk> , and you 're not going to get there .
So the result is <unk> .
There are Yves <unk> .
And Rick <unk> is a furniture <unk> <unk> who made this <unk> furniture .
This is a penguin 's chair , and it 's missing a ball ; it does n't have a ball , and it 's not paying attention .
And the most amazing thing is that you believe this explanation .
That 's the joy of emotions .
This is a new story .
From the beginning , I just started to say something about it .
<unk>
In <unk> 2007 , <unk> <unk> talks about his " <unk> project . How do kids use computers to use surgery , and to teach other kids what kids can teach ?
children , culture , education , global issues , military talk
175
<unk> <unk> demos how to teach children
I 'm a very big job today .
Because I 've seen the printing of everybody in the room , and you know all of you from different backgrounds , but also for a lot of people , building networks , building networks and so forth .
And in only 20 minutes , I 'm going to show you four things , and they 're like four <unk> .
And if I did that , you might probably think about the amount of force or help me get out of my work .
So first of all , that 's the relationship between the remote levels and the quality of education .
In remote areas , it 's not one .
And of course , it 's usually like , for example , when you start to go from scratch , then you get closer and closer to the area .
How does it make a difference ?
The second one or another means that the cities are in the world , there are <unk> , slums , where they look at social status , and they 're not going to look at the other areas .
So what does it look like ?
Remember the definition of these two levels of individuals .
And we did a guess . This is a college school .
Even , schools are hard to do .
They lack <unk> infrastructure .
Even some <unk> , schools are hard to cope with these facilities .
I want to test it whether it 's going to match the truth , so we rented the car , and in Google , we 've rented a road from the <unk> to India to the north of the West to Indian areas , or the road , where we get 300 kilometers of <unk> , when we find a school test , that we have an <unk> test .
This is really interesting , of course , you need to be careful .
I mean , this is just a small figure ; we ca n't calculate .
But this is really clear that it 's a very clear thing to do with the journey that I picked , the more part of the school , and the results are <unk> .
That 's really interesting . I 'm trying to combine the results , like the infrastructure or the <unk> and so on .
What 's unexpected is that these things are not relevant .
This is the result of the <unk> .
infrastructure , infrastructure .
<unk> are not . There is no relationship .
And then I did a <unk> in every school , and he just asked the question that teachers had a problem : Are you going to go to the cities ? Well , you can see the <unk> of the city , the teacher would say , well , it was n't a good thing to tell you , because , in Delhi , there was no way to think about it .
I can be able to figure out the code , a teacher walks into the class every day , and it 's going to make a better job of a better school .
<unk> , the teacher 's job of the teachers and the bears are relatively much more powerful than kids , and it 's a little bit more <unk> for elementary school education .
And when you talk about education and technology , I 've read the web , the website , collaboration -- you 're waiting every morning -- it 's always the best schools , or <unk> , in the next morning , and I think these are the results of the problem .
And these are the numbers -- there 's a couple of people who are <unk> , and it 's very glamorous to celebrate technology .
And teachers often say , well , good , but the price of education has gone up .
Because it turns out that the student is able to get a lot of fun in school .
And then they came up with this <unk> , and they could collect it .
And then the governor came up and said , " Well , three million dollars per year ? "
If you compare the same technology in the middle of these <unk> schools , the administrators are increasing from <unk> , like four , which is completely different .
So , education technology , in the bottom of the pyramid , works more <unk> than the surface , but we 're very ugly .
So I came up with this : education technology needs to take care of <unk> , rather than professional groups .
The final question is , how do you transform the teachers of teachers ?
When you show a teacher from the teacher , the first response is that she 's sure that you ca n't use a machine -- absolutely impossible .
I do n't know why not , but even if you think that this ca n't -- I want to say a word of Arthur Arthur C. Clarke .
And he said , if a teacher does n't use machine , then they 're going to be used by machine .
And this gives the <unk> to the press , and you have to <unk> .
Anyway , I think we need to have a kind of suppressing <unk> , and this is a way to engage all sorts of needs , to help without schools , schools that are n't good at universities , whether it 's not good enough to deal with the schools .
If you do n't have any <unk> , you 're not going to do this .
So far , I 've been in a place where I do n't have any circumstances , which I 'm not saying , well , in this place , people tell me that there 's no problem , because our teachers and schools are <unk> .
That 's where there is , but -- I never said anything about it .
I 'm going to talk about how kids and self - organize , and a series of experiments to describe what is <unk> teaching .
These experiments are called " <unk> Test . "
I have to introduce it to it . This is a series of experiments .
The first experiment was 1999 in New Delhi .
We 're very simple at work .
And I was in a city on the city , and there was a wall between the offices and the <unk> .
This is a hole on the walls -- <unk> -- " <unk> " -- in the cave , a powerful PC , the computer , which is <unk> , and it 's <unk> the other side of the wall -- the speed of <unk> and the Internet -- and then there 's a touch <unk> that goes on walls and <unk> with the Web .
That 's the point .
That 's my office . This is " <unk> . "
About eight hours , we found this child .
The kid on the right is eight -- he 's six years old .
And he 's teaching her how to <unk> the page .
There is no solution in this scenario , but it 's a more new problem .
Is this possible ? Is it <unk> ? Because he does n't know English ?
How much can it be able to save it ? Are they holding it up ?
And the last question is <unk> us , and they 're just going to get rid of the wall and ask the people in the streets , but you can teach me how to do it .
So I left in Delhi , and I went to the other place . This time we arrived in the middle of the city . I heard all the people are <unk> .
And the weather is very hot , " <unk> is shaped in the old building , and it 's the first kid to reach at the age of 13 .
And he came up and started playing with play .
And very quickly , he noticed that when the patient was on the door , one thing in the screen was moving -- and he told me , I never saw this kind of a television game .
And he found out the principles . He realized that he was in control .
As soon as it was , he was n't careful about the door -- you could see it on the screen .
And he clicks the <unk> , and the Internet analyzed the website .
And after eight minutes later , he looked at the screen and saw it , and he 's going to see the page .
And then he started <unk> kids , and these kids came up with <unk> .
And it 's about 70 children in the Internet .
That seems to be a little bit more than a eight - year - old computer computer .
And we came up with this : a group of kids used to use computers and networks , but what does it need ?
Now , our main problem is English .
Some people say , you should be able to make a version of the <unk> computer and the Web .
I said , " What 's going to be going on ? How do you go into the world ? "
So , you have to come up with another solution .
So , let 's look at how these kids get rid of this problem .
This particular experiment was taken into a village called <unk> , and here , there 's no reason why you do n't know why , in English , it 's a little bit of a English teacher .
It 's a " <unk> " .
And what 's different from the city is , in this village , the girl in the village is more than boys .
And in cities , girls tend to stay in much larger .
I put some CDs in the computer -- not connected -- three months later .
And then I went back and I saw these two kids , <unk> , and they were playing computer games .
And they saw me , " We need a faster processor and a good mouse . "
I was shocked .
How do they do that ?
And they said , " Well , we 're like a CD .
And I asked , but how do you understand what it says ?
And they said , you put this machine here , and it just shows English , so we 're going to write English .
And then afterward , they 've got 200 <unk> , you teach me , I teach you -- although the word " <unk> " is not standard , but they 're doing it for <unk> -- and they do n't have to use -- like a <unk> .
<unk> , kids seem to prove that language is not an obstacle , and they actually have the ability to educate new languages , as they really want to learn .
And finally , I grew up for enough money to do this experiment , and look at the same thing .
That 's the good place for India , because , we 've got the diversity diversity of diversity , genes , <unk> biodiversity , and also social diversity .
So , I can find a sample of what 's going to happen in the world .
I spent about five years on top of this experiment , and it took us to the locations of India .
This is <unk> , and in the southern winter , sand .
I have to find or develop a kind of false <unk> , and it allows me to use all sorts of different kinds of varying conditions , which I need to do in a variety of ways , because , in fact , we 're afraid , the climate crisis , the climate .
This is the West desert , approaching the border of Pakistan .
There 's a little clip here -- one of those villages -- the first thing that these kids do is to find a website to educate a site .
This is a <unk> in the center of India , the climate , and it 's possible to make the muscle <unk> .
In no air , we have to figure out how to overcome all the hard things . In the end , then we use <unk> as drive machines .
I want to be very short . We 've done the same experiment everywhere .
And this was really good . This was a six - year - old boy who taught his sister .
An age - old child uses his age with his old kids , and this is the case .
What does that mean ? We found that six to five percent of kids are self - teaching in groups , but why not yet .
As soon as they <unk> computers , they can self - teaching , learning smart information .
I do n't know anything , but I know that must happen in groups .
And this is really good for this crowd , because you all belong to a population .
Now you see a bunch of kids who do n't do anything , even without adults .
I 'm going to tell you a little bit about how to measure it .
What we use is the standard data device , which is n't much more about .
We came up with a clear study of learning , and this is exactly the same thing in school .
I do n't have a lot of explanation because , right ?
What do children learn ?
And basically , <unk> , and <unk> and talk , email , games , video , reveal music , video videos .
That 's what we 're going to do . They 're all .
A computer is in a six - year - old age to learn how to use computers and everything .
What do they do ?
If you 're in the use of their use , you 'll see that the average is a few minutes per day , so it ca n't say anything .
Indeed , a child is driving computers .
And he went around , and he was able to show him what to do .
If you test them , the four kids get the same <unk> , whatever .
And over the other four children of the four kids who are talking about the advice , but they 're always a false suggestion .
And their results are also the same .
So they learned the same thing through <unk> .
It does n't look like adults , but , for a young age , kids live in a <unk> society , and they do their own decisions , as adults say , do n't touch it .
How do you do that ?
And he 's going to look at how to do that , and it 's how to do it .
If you test him , he can answer every question about this debate .
They seem very , very quickly .
So , what do you tell us about this ?
It tells us that it can be done by dignity , or in a certain sense .
It does n't need to be <unk> .
You can use a system that 's the second line that I want to say , that children can learn a teaching teaching .
And thirdly and values have relationships , simple things , and I 've been doing a test for India everywhere . I asked them -- I 'm going to give them a <unk> question about values .
They answer all sorts : <unk> , right , or I do n't know .
There are places , 50 percent answer : 50 answers , and I 'm looking for 16 .
Some of the kids in the values of values feel chaotic because they say , 50 people say yes .
One of the classic problems is , sometimes , <unk> is necessary .
They do n't know the answer ; maybe we do n't know the answer .
And I 'll leave you with the third problem .
How can technology change values ?
And finally , self - <unk> , I would n't say , because I 've talked a lot about it .
Faces of nature are <unk> : galaxies , molecules , cells , <unk> , biodiversity , social design -- even controversial controversial .
But as far as the Scientific development , it 's also <unk> .
There are more people , <unk> , social and social authorities , terrorists and <unk> .
And you 're familiar with the <unk> of the Internet .
That 's my four summary .
<unk> impact on remote effects .
We should first use education for the first time , and then we go to other areas .
The values of values are <unk> ; <unk> is <unk> -- this is the opposite .
They learn a system that has self - <unk> systems .
Let 's put it together -- I think -- that made us a goal for education .
That 's the winner , and apathy , <unk> , the bottom <unk> of the Internet , connecting the Internet , <unk> and <unk> .
And as a student , we never asked using education technologies ; we just had to use technology .
And the slide is really good education , but it does n't have to teach services , it 's used for meetings .
We put it in . We 've got <unk> technology and PC .
And I think it 's time for me to have their own <unk> , and I have some kind of <unk> .
These are the ones that should be able to create the problems of the remote problem , values and the problems of violence and the problem .
I have a name -- it 's called <unk> .
How do we treat it as educational as education ?
I want to leave you with the decisions .
Thank you .
<unk>
Over 15 years of Britain in Britain , <unk> <unk> became an <unk> of independent <unk> , manage , in the International Society of the international relationship , developed a whole new way of speaking , and in business , he calls a new approach to <unk> the world , allowing a little bit of a change in innovation , to be able to make a difference .
global issues , military , innovation , politics , productivity , building
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : A independent <unk>
My story is about war .
It 's about vision .
It 's about death .
It 's about <unk> in debris .
And maybe , also , a couple of years ago , the <unk> of the 21st century , the 21st century , the 21st century .
I do n't believe <unk> story .
I do n't believe that in life or histories of the history of history , the <unk> B B is the result of B -- and that 's what we 're going to inspire the simplicity of each other .
I think one of the reasons why I 'm a <unk> is because I become an <unk> .
I 'm <unk> .
I 'm going to tell you that most of the colors .
And this is why I always wear a blank jacket , and I have to take my wife , I 've had to hold my <unk> .
I always wanted to be a pilot .
I love to look at the plane speed speed , and we 're flying in the middle of the road .
The dream of my son was when I was a pilot .
I went to the Royal Air Force trial , and of course , I failed .
And I ca n't tell you how different it is , and I ca n't tell you about color .
So , I have to choose other professions , and it 's really easy for me , because I 've got a <unk> passion , which is international relations .
I was a kid who was very close to me .
" The storyline of the Cold War News " is freaking me out , and I 'm fascinated by the <unk> of <unk> , which is that the church and the United States in the past .
In <unk> or Afghanistan , <unk> .
I 'm very interested in these things .
So I decided to determine that I wanted to be <unk> .
And I said , one day my parents came up with this idea -- my dad does n't acknowledge this story -- I say , " Father , I want to become a <unk> . "
And he looked at me , and he said , " <unk> , you have to be very clever to become <unk> . "
And I 'm more concerned about my <unk> .
<unk> , I joined the U.K.
In the year , there were five people winning the lottery .
This is a data that says , I 've been fascinated by a brilliant world of intellectual property .
It 's an <unk> , and it 's a great job , I 've got every minute of my work . I enjoy working .
I 've got a good coat of coat , and I 'm wearing a beautiful way to <unk> the world that 's going to happen to me .
I went to <unk> areas .
I led to the Middle East community .
I became an <unk> historian .
I 've got <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the United Nations .
And then I went to Afghanistan in the Taliban 's service service .
I came up with a C - meter trip , and I went to visit the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , where they were working on what we 're going to get out of Afghanistan , so I 've got a <unk> force , which is really dangerous .
It 's a very exciting thing to be interested in . It 's fun .
It 's really interesting .
They 're the elite , and they 're very glamorous .
I was the top of my career , and I found myself in New York .
And I was in German , and I had a lot of service in the <unk> , but I went to New York , and I was sent to New York as a <unk> .
My responsibility is the Middle East , and it 's my inheritance .
And in there , I 've plotted the same thing as the Middle East of Middle Eastern peace -- if you 're interested in -- but most importantly , my responsibility is to be in Iraq and it 's a huge tradition of war and its huge destruction of Iraq , and we 're dealing with our <unk> .
<unk> is the chief of England in this case , and I <unk> in that event .
Anyway , my journey -- is very , very exciting .
I mean it 's a very dramatic entrepreneur .
We went through a lot of war times when I was in New York .
I 'm going to show you my country in <unk> , and at <unk> a.m. of attacks , of course , it 's really important for us to live in that moment in New York .
It was the worst when the best happened .
I have a lifetime of life .
And despite my work , I lived in the <unk> apartments apartment apartment .
I 'm a British <unk> in New York ; you can imagine what that means .
I have a wonderful moment .
But in <unk> , when my <unk> came to the end , I decided I did n't want to go back in London .
I decided to take out the fact that , in the new university university , Bruce .
In the early days , <unk> , I realized some things about my job , and myself .
I did n't know what I was like to say from a certain way .
So I decided to look at other things in the workplace .
<unk> are generous .
You can enjoy these special <unk> , and they say , but still in a foreign service , there 's no job .
I 'm good .
And finally , I decided to make a <unk> to join the United Nations in Iran , and that was the place where the U.N. was in the United Nations .
There are two things that happened in Kosovo , and again , showing the nature of life , because these things came into my life to help me get the next life stage .
But it 's all a random thing .
One of the things that is , in summer , the U.K. , Britain , a little bit of <unk> , decided to go out in Iraq , and that 's a very limited question .
And I had the secret to <unk> that poll .
I 've been haunted by the <unk> of Iraq and large destruction , and I think three things about this research , which is that governments are <unk> , from the past year I have spent a lot of understanding what it is .
And of course , our interior of our own lives is very clear that Iraq is a huge <unk> in Iraq , and it 's more likely to say that it 's a lot more than <unk> .
Secondly , governments lie all over the way , but in some ways , it 's more glamorous from it .
And the third reason , I do n't say .
But no matter what I did , I brought the challenge to my challenge .
I 'm going to do something .
And this was deeply true , and my colleagues , my colleague , <unk> , who I found , is their mistakes .
Meanwhile , I 'm in the middle of the crisis .
That 's not something good .
And I did n't know , I 've done it with my wife and wives , and then I decided to come from <unk> .
And I feel -- like Al Gore 's movie , " <unk> " and you might have seen that film , and he 's going to go back to the kindergarten museum -- and they 're saying , ' You know , I ca n't do it again . Some things do n't happen . Somebody else .
It 's like me . I love that film .
And I feel like something else is .
I could n't tell my foreign foreign or my Prime Minister , as I used to do that , like I did .
That feeling is like flying on the edge of a cliff .
That feeling is very , very uncomfortable .
I started thinking about it .
Until today , there are n't still stopped ; I still feel <unk> .
But , in some way , I used to use this feeling .
From a certain way , I even like a little bit more like this .
And the second thing in Kosovo , I 'm sorry , I 'm going to <unk> water .
And the second thing that 's happening in Kosovo is about getting a answer , and I ca n't answer the answer .
I love diplomacy . It does n't have a career . I expect my entire life for <unk> , for my country .
I hope to be a <unk> , my mentor , and my heroes , who get to the middle of the career , I 'm still going to die .
A lot of my friends .
My <unk> .
I 'm going to stop it .
What do I do ?
And that year , a very , very bad thing happened in Kosovo .
Yves <unk> , terrible anti - <unk> -- 1968 -- Kosovo , Kosovo .
Everyone was killed .
That 's a climb .
<unk> state is really scary , curiosity police , military personnel -- lots of military <unk> -- not able to stop the richness in the streets .
And the only way to stop that is that they 're trying to get to the corner of the street , and they decide when they think they 're going to get rid of it , and they 're going to get tired of it . They do n't think it 's too bad to make it feel like they feel that they want it to go back and get rid of the <unk> , right ?
It 's not a good sensation , I 've seen it .
I went through all of this . I did n't think of it .
And the same friend of my friends , we try to stop .
There 's something that teaches me some things , not obvious .
One of the reasons why it 's happening -- the <unk> , the very few days , is a good couple days -- because of Iran 's future .
There was a battle of civic diplomacy in Kosovo , united by Iran , to say that Iranian people are not really involved in these players .
The whole <unk> of diplomacy seems to be in the process of Iraq , Iran , Kosovo 's work .
<unk> , they feel very frustrated .
<unk> is part of the <unk> .
It 's not the only reason that life is n't just , a single story .
That 's a complex thing , and I 'm not going to pretend that it 's easy to look at it .
But that 's one thing .
And that gives me an inspiration -- or more accurately , to give my wife a encouraging .
She said , " Why do n't you help Iran ?
Why do n't you help their government ? "
Kosovo is not allowed to have diplomacy .
They 're not allowed to have <unk> .
They 're not allowed to have <unk> helping them to deal with this incredibly complex process , and then this becomes an ongoing event in Kosovo .
And this is what it is .
That 's the original idea that ended up independent <unk> , the world 's first <unk> group , and also non - profit .
It started the end of the United Nations in Iran , in Kosovo .
At the same time , when I went to dinner , I told him , " Look , let me show you that I 'm going to give you a lot of money .
And I know this area . I 'm doing this . Why do n't I help you ? "
And he went to his wine , and he said , " Okay , <unk> . Come on . "
So I came up to Kosovo in Iran .
independent <unk> ultimately helped for three <unk> of <unk> and Kosovo .
Kosovo 's independence .
The independent entrepreneur has been built in the next five agricultural center of the world , and we helped teach <unk> eight different countries , the political community , according to how to define them -- I do n't think so much .
We give <unk> to the advice of the rainforest .
We do a lot of <unk> for <unk> in the South Side of the West , and you might have heard about them -- the next few years to be a new country .
We give <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , who are 34 years old to their country .
We 're going to have a lot of <unk> to change the ice in Copenhagen .
There 's also <unk> because , when I started becoming a independent <unk> , I came up with a <unk> party , which was fun , and I 'd like to stand up and sit at me .
And we started talking , and he said -- I told him what I was doing , I 'm going to tell him a little bit about <unk> in New York .
And that time , only my wife , I was ready to moved to New York .
And he said , " Why do n't you look at me in New York ? "
And it turns out he 's for a book called " <unk> , " if it 's a innovation of innovation .
So one thing to do is , I ended up in New York ? If it 's a company job , when I start to rebel .
You see ?
<unk> invented a new portrait or Coke , or <unk> , actually helped me think about new diplomacy , in Iran .
And I started to realize that there are many different ways to do diplomacy and diplomacy , like <unk> , which is an ongoing destination , but in terms of capitalism , it does n't have innovation and play and reality , and there 's a couple of things that they 've always done .
And the independent <unk> , today , is trying to try to make me on ?
We 're all in a offices , and we 're on the other side of the offices .
We 're all working on little <unk> , trying to move through the table to change our minds .
We do n't really know what they 're going to do for us , but they might know some other things that try to solve new ideas into the problems that we try and fix it .
This is n't easy , because our clients , in the definition , are very difficult in terms of capitalism .
I do n't know , some of the interviews of people , personal , political -- that 's the same thing .
From the individual , from the lens , it 's actually a good thing , and I tell you .
It 's a good thing to do in your life , but it 's just going to jump all the time .
The second thing is that a larger lesson about this world today .
One of the things that <unk> <unk> is the trend is that it 's emerging around the world , and the world is <unk> .
The state of the state is less than a lot of state .
That means the power of other things rising up .
Those are the things that are called <unk> .
They might be a big corporation , and they could be <unk> , they would be good non - organization .
We live in a much more complex world .
If you do n't have the ability to influence problems in the world , what does it mean that the next future is going to take them , who will get better responsibility for them ?
We 're .
If they do n't do it , who will do it ?
We do n't have the option , only for reality .
That 's what they 're going to be able to say is enough , international relations or global relations , or the world 's worst , chaotic chaos , whatever you can do about it .
And I can use any of you to do a lot of young guys with <unk> <unk> .
And let me ask you , but if you eat fish , it 's interesting , that 's a connection .
We are connected to each other .
This is not just Tom <unk> , it 's actually demonstrated by one another .
That means , besides your politicians to do things , you have to deal with things .
<unk> <unk> is an example of something that is not very glamorous .
There 's no perfect example , but there 's an example : the way the world works is changing the place where I 've done it , changing .
The U.N. is formed .
The United Nations is essentially teaching conflict to the state of conflict -- <unk> , purity .
Today , <unk> percent of the scheduled communities are the state of conflict , widely spread into non - <unk> -- <unk> , purity , terrorists , and if you want to say that , they 're non - <unk> , <unk> states .
That 's the world .
When I realized that , when I was looking at what happened to my time in Iran , I found that normally , usually , most of the people who were going to do it in front of us , they were not invited to the <unk> , and I think it was n't appropriate .
We should do it .
So I started doing traditional ways .
I <unk> with my colleagues colleagues in my independence .
And we visited the <unk> of the United Nations -- <unk> , and <unk> -- and the Israeli -- you can <unk> them -- the U.N. , all the people , they say , " This is n't appropriate .
You do n't want to talk about people directly .
You should be building a system where you can actually ask people to tell you how they think .
And that makes you tell me -- you can tell them how to think .
It 's great . You can do it .
You can bring these people to the people in your decision , so your decisions are the most efficient . "
<unk> logic , you might think that .
I said , this idea is great . Obviously , anyone can do it .
And of course , everybody knows it . Everybody says , " Yes , you 're definitely right .
That 's a six months later . "
Of course , nothing happened . Nobody did anything . No one did anything .
<unk> is the same way that the old way of doing today is that I 've been there .
And we 're looking at the failure of the failures and think about what we 're doing .
I think , if I 'm going to use my <unk> to the church , I will stop it .
So , let 's start with these meetings .
Now , independently <unk> is a meeting between the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and the meetings in <unk> , and the meetings in <unk> .
We brought across Darfur , the government of the federal government , <unk> <unk> and <unk> people , from <unk> , who had a long list of <unk> and <unk> conflict .
We 're going to bring <unk> to New York in a quiet house that does n't have the media to talk about the <unk> of the United States , and they 're talking about what they want to tell them , what the U.N. is telling them what to want .
It 's a real conversation that never happened .
And of course , the people who describe these , anyone knows that this is very , very difficult , and I 've totally <unk> .
The possibility of failures is very , very high , but not impossible if we 're dealing with it .
My political view has changed from me as an entrepreneur , and I think the results are important , not the processes , rather than technology .
All of the <unk> members of Iran in Iran now are now in the political prison of Tehran , and there 's been no schooling .
In Iran , technology shoots up political changes .
And look at the results , and you say , " Well , what can we do about this ? "
This is the politics of the 21st century , and from a certain way , local contracts , where we 're going to have the ones that are going to happen .
That 's my story . Thank you .
<unk>
The high high school teacher , <unk> , had a <unk> bacteria -- -- but the students did n't know what he was doing , and the question was that it was n't hard to understand the <unk> of the other person . He 's going to tell you about it .
biology , children , education , science
<unk>
<unk> : Hey , teachers ! Let 's make science fun .
I 'll give you a story .
I was a year at high school teachers , and I was very positive .
Very exciting , I 've got my work on my teaching .
But I realized that a terrible reality was that my students could n't learn anything .
And one day , I read a book to the author , and this is the title of my favorite theme -- viruses and <unk> principle .
And I 'm excited to be able to talk to them about this content , and I go into the class , ask , " Can you tell the <unk> content , why is that cool ?
It 's a <unk> .
And finally , my favorite student , she looked at me , and she said , " Very glamorous . "
And she 's <unk> , and she said , " I 'm not saying that I ca n't understand the content , I mean .
Very boring . Yeah , <unk> him , it 's <unk> .
There 's a lot of noise in classrooms , and I realized that all of the students in the classroom are the same thing . They might do a " <unk> , " but no one really understood it .
No one can tell me why this is interesting , why it 's important .
I was completely shocked .
I do n't know what to do .
I think the only thing to do is say , " Listen , I 'll give you a story .
The <unk> of the story is bacterial and oxygen .
Now the <unk> of my hand is <unk> millions .
The real virus and bacterial bacteria are very low , and we can only use the microscope to see it . You might be very unfamiliar for bacterial and virus .
But a lot of people do n't know , the virus can also make the difference . "
And then I started telling the students a little bit about the story .
A little bit of a happy bacteria ago .
It 's a lot of money .
And he might be walking in your face , or in some terrible food , and suddenly , he started feeling big .
Maybe he 's a <unk> <unk> , and it becomes very scary , it 's got a virus from his body .
And what 's even more disturbing is that the body explosion <unk> , and the virus is <unk> from germs .
If -- ooh , yes -- if you 're a bacterium , you 've seen this , and this is the most scary nightmare you 've ever seen .
But if you 're a virus , <unk> , you might say , " Well , we 're going to die . "
Because viruses need to spread through a very clever way .
Same process .
A virus grabs a bacterium , and it tries to bring DNA into bacteria .
And the next thing is , the DNA of the virus creates some material to <unk> the DNA of the bacteria .
Now the DNA of the bacteria has already been destroyed , the number of DNA control entire cells , and then the virus starts to replicate more viruses .
Because , you see , DNA looks like a piece of representation of a building life that creates <unk> .
This is like an <unk> factory running , and started building robotic robots .
And the second day the workers came to work at work , but they made a difference .
So , the DNA of the bacteria to <unk> bacterial DNA is to enable bacterial tissue to become a structure , until it 's produced by the virus , which is <unk> by bacteria <unk> .
But this is not the only way that bacteria bacteria .
It 's a bit more <unk> .
When a virus is called a bacterial infection , the <unk> cycle .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> is going to send DNA to bacteria cells , but it does n't happen : it does n't hurt germs -- at least .
Instead , it <unk> up to the DNA of the bacterium itself , <unk> a <unk> , waiting to wait .
What 's interesting is that when the bacteria started galloping , it had a little baby of their kids when it started .
So when bacterial seals became a living , every family member had a virus .
They 're happy to live together . So , " anesthesia ! "
The virus is made of these cells , allowing them to create a virus factory , and make them full of germs , so it 's a bacteria that 's been infected with bacteria , which is <unk> by bacteria .
So you can understand how this virus leads cells .
There are two ways of doing that : on the left , we 've got <unk> infections , viruses when it comes into the whole cell .
We 're on the right - hand side of the world , which is the <unk> of the virus .
So these things are n't so glamorous , right ?
Now you can understand that .
As long as you get in high school , I would assure you almost something .
It 's just this knowledge of knowledge , and nothing to leave you with .
So when my students learn about these things , why do they hate them ?
And of course , there 's a bunch of reasons .
<unk> , I can guarantee that they do n't have a <unk> <unk> or a terrible story .
There are often people who vary in the science of the scientific community .
I was being tortured to death , and indeed .
I used to be in a educational book as a cartoonist , and I was told never to use a story , or <unk> <unk> , because if I made it , my work would n't be like " serious " and " scientific " .
Right ? It 's like God ca n't learn in science .
So we have a lot of <unk> changes in the field , notice this .
And then , of course , we have a good scientist named <unk> !
But if it 's too interesting , it seems that it 's not science .
Another problem is that the language of <unk> is really incapable of understanding .
And if we want to summarize the story we 've talked about , we can say , " Well , viruses are going to be able to replicate their DNA to bacterial bodies . "
But if you write the language in the textbooks , it becomes like this : " <unk> <unk> , " which is <unk> from a virus . "
That 's really good , for 13 kids .
But the problem is that a lot of people in the science are looking at the Renaissance and said that they ca n't teach them because of the religious , it 's not true .
So , for example , I told you that this virus has DNA .
Well , small amounts of viruses are not DNA .
In contrast , there 's another object called <unk> .
And so the professional scientific author estimates that , " This is no exaggeration .
I need to use more <unk> science . "
And then at the end of the professional scientific team , they might find a simple explanation of what 's going on , and they have to have all sorts of problems that do n't care about all the <unk> places where they 're not going to be <unk> .
Now it might be accurate , but it 's completely incapable of understanding .
That 's pretty scary .
I 've always been talking to the idea of teaching stories , but the science curriculum is based on what I call <unk> <unk> .
<unk> stories are terrible , and it 's going to turn the scientific lessons to teach us , as " Oh , someday I 'm wearing my friends , she 's wearing a good day .
I mean , they 're not really true ; it 's <unk> legs , but , I think they are a bit more like a <unk> but I want to say , " Oh , my God . "
What 's the point ? "
Or worse , science education becomes a lot of people who say , " <unk> . "
Right ? Suppose you think , " Oh , boy , we 're going to drive 100 kilometers away in the sky . "
And one person said , " Actually , it 's a <unk> lake . "
And then you say , " Actually , <unk> ! "
" I just want to say one story . "
The good news is to focus on emotions .
We need to convince our listeners that we 're very important .
And what 's important is that you know that <unk> is going to get rid of invisible detail .
And I remember building <unk> <unk> , and I 'll explain that , when he says , sometimes you have to engage the truth .
And I think that 's the kind of thing with science .
Now , finally , I often feel that people will think I 'm in <unk> science .
Not that .
Now , I 'm a MIT student at MIT , and I understand the importance of detail between detail , which is particularly important to communicate , but in the age of 13 , it is not that important .
If a child thinks it 's a <unk> of DNA , so it ruins them as a lawyer .
But if a child could n't understand the knowledge of science in science , because of these boring things , it really would destroy the opportunity for their success .
This need to change . I hope these changes from the old institutions that make them realize that the problem is , I 'm going to ask them to do it .
But I do n't think that 's true .
And so we 're very lucky to have the resources that we have to do with the Internet , and we can change these <unk> .
The <unk> of the Internet are increasingly getting more and more , and they 're trying to explain the laws of science and <unk> .
I hope that there 's an Wikipedia website that explains what you can think of as a member of any kind of language that any student can understand .
And I spent my time to work with my <unk> to make these YouTube online courses .
<unk> <unk> : I 'm going to tell you a little bit about chemistry <unk> , and I do n't want to explain the story of <unk> .
And I 've got a lot of fun , and often I have all sorts of conversations , but I 'm very grateful for these comments , which I do n't want to know about my way of thinking about what I 'm going to teach .
There are lots of jobs that have to do if you have a science job , and I ask you to join me .
Yves videos , how do you do it , but let 's stop <unk> , <unk> the jargon .
<unk> the audience , attract them .
<unk> the details of the people who care about it .
How ?
Why do n't you try and say , " Come , I 'll give you a story . "
Thank you .

The film is <unk> by the Ashanti television singer , and she shares a bold research result , which is tracking 50 percent of the way that 50 years of <unk> to the television rate , to reveal the truth .
culture , entertainment
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : A leap of television
And what I want to say is that the <unk> of these remarkable talks and <unk> , I 'm really in a strange situation , because it 's a television show .
Almost everybody 's television .
We love television at least .
In America , people love television .
The average American watches five hours per day .
Right ?
I 've always been on the television , so it 's a good thing for me .
A lot of people do n't like it .
In fact , <unk> TV .
They 're called " <unk> Of <unk> . "
My mother , in my way , is called " <unk> box . "
But I 'm not going to talk to you today about the <unk> of television , which is to tell you about openness to television .
Why I believe television has ADHD because I think the need to reflect on the morality of morality , the political and emotion , because television is the way we spread the whole values of values .
So the characteristics of humans are made of understanding our understanding .
We 're not talking today about television .
We talked about a blank television .
Fifty years in the ' 50s <unk> <unk> .
John Hockenberry : How many of you are social roles , and then 50 years in the ' 50s and ' 60s , how to transform our societies ?
How about the TV , how do you fold the social reality ?
To think about evolution , you think of animals as humans , including four basic characteristics .
<unk> , compassion , power and <unk> .
As humans , importantly , we evolved in a long period of time .
We can laugh and cry .
We feel awe and compassion .
This is what we 're talking about .
Another property of humans is we love entertainment .
We love television .
This is the difference .
animals like play , but they do n't like to watch it .
So I 'm trying to explore the relationship between the TV and the human mind , and that 's allowing us to predict what makes us tick .
Why do television evolve for it ?
And I think that it 's like <unk> <unk> and <unk> , sitting in our shoulders .
Are television really like ours , where we reward us ?
And we did a research for the answer .
From 50 years ago , we started the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
Every year we 've been looking at the next 20 television television show -- from a thousand TV TV .
We 're almost <unk> by three <unk> , almost 18 years of <unk> -- 18 to 70 .
How do they feel how to look at this television ?
Is there a moral dispute ?
Anybody feel bad ? Huh ?
Right ?
So for global TED audience , I want to say that this is an American museum .
But these feelings are driven by themselves .
Another reality is that more than 80 percent of the American TV <unk> travel across the world .
So I wish I would have the global audiences .
So , first of all , I 'm going to thank you two people in the data : one of the things that inspired me to thinking about this problem , and how it impacts our everyday lives , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Another way to release data , I 'm grateful for the TED community , and Hans Rosling , you might have seen this .
Okay , let 's start .
And here 's the research research from 1960 to 50 years .
We 've moved from both sides -- architecture and morality , and we define what we 're doing with television .
The moral law is that those are the ones that I do n't understand about <unk> .
You see that 1960 starts in 1960 .
That 's why we watch television .
The moral law starts to start .
And then the <unk> morality is the foundation of the rise of <unk> .
Why ?
<unk> chewing on the <unk> of the U.S.
Just look at what change there .
In the ' 70s , the building goes down .
morality is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , but <unk> Reagan , the president of the <unk> president .
Just try to <unk> it .
But look , it 's not HIV / AIDS , Iran .
The moral law is driven by the <unk> of the TV , which starts in the 1920s .
And look at this one .
This graph will show you very similar trend .
But at this point , there 's <unk> -- <unk> , social commentary and not " blue and <unk> . "
And the TV was able to see " The Great <unk> , " remember " <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> is rising .
It 's not <unk> .
social commentary suddenly <unk> .
Look at the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> and social reviews , had two videos -- " The <unk> <unk> " and " <unk> of <unk> ' -- in the ' 60s ' <unk> -- the second TV TV <unk> .
And what 's the first thing ?
<unk> <unk> on <unk> and Martin
They 're all there .
It 's more powerful than the audiences .
And look at this , in 1966 , for a person who does n't want to negotiate .
What do you mean when you hear this business ?
It means that 1966 in 2007 , the <unk> Brothers <unk> <unk> .
This is the first show that makes the audience a little bit like " Oh , " Why can I <unk> with the President of the <unk> ? "
This is what I said .
Last one .
In 1970 , it was <unk> .
It 's not why we 're watching television .
Social <unk> and <unk> in the ' 70s .
Look at this .
What 's the ' 80s ' ' 70s ? ' <unk> <unk> ?
There 's " <unk> " and " The <unk> and the dad ' <unk> ' -- the ' 60s ' Academy ' nurse ' ' 80s ' ] ' 70s . "
In the 50 years of the TV show we 've studied in the ' 50s ' TV shows , the show 's show is five percent of what happened in Vietnam .
It 's just a few minutes , and we 've found that -- wow ! television can do this ?
Can you feel that ?
Can it change us ?
For those smart people , I want to point out that digital years did n't <unk> .
40 years ago , <unk> <unk> had been rejected by <unk> .
This graph is relatively <unk> , and this is another factor of the other element and imagining it 's defined by the word " <unk> Life " and " Let 's feel better . "
This portrait of the red , the <unk> , is just derived from <unk> data .
You can see the show that every single projection of paper is increasing relative to the <unk> .
Do we want to see the show that we 're going to see in the exhibition ?
There was no <unk> in the ' 80s , " The " <unk> <unk> went in in 1973 .
Another growth is the increase in the ' 80s , which is about the rise of control and power .
What is it ?
It 's about love and wealth .
" <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> with a <unk> reality , the health of the nation : this reality is <unk> .
This is my favorite part because this is the last 20 years .
Anyway , you 're sure that part of you you have to hear or read about three or three photos of <unk> handling systems .
The <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
In the ' 90s -- the <unk> of humor , we looked at " <unk> <unk> , " " The <unk> " and " A <unk> . "
They 're all cute , too .
But look at the X - ray .
In 2001 , <unk> <unk> had a change in <unk> in 2001 .
Why ?
That 's the last 2,000 years of <unk> .
Technology mania is broken .
9/11 happened .
It 's called " <unk> <unk> . "
So what can you look behind ?
And as we arrived at this process , the Internet <unk> started <unk> .
What would people see in the television ?
I think it 's <unk> or memory .
I 've got a lot of <unk> for <unk> .
No , they 're fair .
I 'm going to leave you with voting .
I 'm going to keep <unk> <unk> 's daughter by dance .
I 'm going to give you a American award .
So , is that very good ?
So , look at what 's going on in the last 50 years , and how to say , what does it mean ?
We 're animal , and we need mother .
There did n't have a big show in the early ' 80s without a good TV .
Fifty : 50 percent of all the <unk> <unk> in the ' 50s .
Yves <unk> makes us laugh at the <unk> in the ' 80s
<unk> <unk> is about 70 percent of the ' 70s in <unk> , and she had her experience of <unk> and <unk> even even <unk> .
There was Yves <unk> in the ' 80s .
<unk> Brown is because she 's a Mother of her mother 's identity .
The mother of this period is <unk> de <unk> <unk> .
Now I do n't know that the <unk> was sitting in front of our <unk> and sat down on the television account , but I knew I loved this picture .
So for the rest of the world , the global audience , <unk> <unk> , gives me this opportunity to tell me about what 's going on .
I 'm going to thank you to make a new idea of the people in the television , every single day , and every day they put it on television .
They 're going to depend on the lives of the TV , but as the audience , you give television to the community of social consciousness .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> asks a simple , complex problem : why we 're going to continue to find ourselves beyond ? Why do we try to lose ourselves ?
culture , evolution , religion
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : Religions , evolution and self - <unk>
I have a problem to ask you that you have religious religion ?
Please raise your hand if you think you have religion .
Let me show you the next three or four people .
I do n't think much of it in the TED conference .
You 've got a problem here , you think you have antibiotics ? Anybody in any form . Please raise your hand .
Okay , that 's the most important .
What I 'm talking about today is the main cause of this problem , or is that one of the major reasons is why most people think that they 're in some form of stuff .
So what I want to talk about today is self - reflection .
This is the fundamental fact that the human mind is , when it comes down .
And when this feeling happens , it 's <unk> <unk> , and we can also use <unk> and <unk> to explain these feelings .
And what we 're talking about is a sense of rising , or <unk> .
Now , if you think about this kind of stuff , it 's a very difficult thing to do with you , especially a good <unk> .
So let me give you a little bit of a <unk> .
Think about it as a lot of rooms , and most rooms are very familiar with the rooms .
But sometimes , suddenly , there was a door that did n't get out of the open open muscle in front of you .
We 're looking at the <unk> and experiences that change the process .
The great American psychologist <unk> <unk> wrote a lot of different religions .
He sampled all sorts of cases .
And the words of different people who have different sorts of verbal experience have different beliefs .
And what I was excited about was a young man named Steven <unk> who said he was born in <unk> <unk> .
Next is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : I think I 've seen the <unk> , the form of <unk> that I have in my room , and I 'm going to have a second one to say , " Come on . "
And the next day I did n't think that .
I feel so happy that I 'm going to die .
This world has no emotional place for me .
Before this time , I was very selfish and <unk> .
But I 'm going to talk about the joy of the entire species of human beings , and also hope to take a chunk of heart <unk> to forgive me the best enemy .
<unk> : So it 's hard to find how hard it is to get rid of the <unk> process .
In this high quality level , he becomes compassion to compassion .
Many of the religions in the world found a lot of help to climb their <unk> .
Some of them are <unk> to forget yourself .
Some people can use <unk> .
This is from the <unk> <unk> of the 16th century , which describes a man who is eating <unk> , and , at the same time , he was rejected by God .
The other way that other people are dancing , leads to the ability to increase the skill of self - reflection .
But you do n't need to depend on a religious religion .
A lot of people found themselves in nature .
Other people are looking at self - <unk> .
But one of the most curious places is in war .
A lot of the books that have been talked about the same thing about war is that there 's no such thing as war as a war .
And the force that <unk> people to connect together is the possibility of a kind of <unk> experience .
I 'm going to show you a clip from <unk> Graham .
<unk> is a soldier in the South World War II .
He interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote a book about soldiers about soldiers .
And there 's a great deal of <unk> in the video that describes this <unk> .
<unk> : And so many of the authorities will recognize that this experience has become part of their life .
" And I said , " I 'm going to become " we " -- " my " I. "
And I believe that this is completely irrelevant , and this confidence that keeps sacrifice in these situations .
I can fall , but I ca n't be <unk> because I 'm going to move forward and live with them .
<unk> : All of these sorts of things are called " self - <unk> , " which seems to be <unk> or disappear , and it 's really a good thing to think of what 's happening in our lives .
You feel <unk> .
This spirit is also great in the <unk> of the French Revolution .
And <unk> is called the <unk> , or <unk> .
And he 's called a low - scale ratio called " <unk> . "
The Jews are the sanctity of the sanctity .
It means normal or ordinary .
We live in our normal lives .
We want to engage our individual desires .
We 've observed our personal goal .
But sometimes there are some things that cause progress .
The individuals are united to become a team , a movement , or a state of state , which is far beyond these individuals .
It 's called the <unk> realm , because he believes that the function of religion is to make people become an active dynamic group .
<unk> thinks that anything that makes us connect together in a marble colors .
And when people are in the realm of the sacred realm , or the glass of <unk> , they 're bringing together to unite together to unite the world .
<unk> once mentioned a very strong collective of emotions that can become a fantastic <unk> , which is a powerful collective , rather than an individual .
And you can recall the <unk> of a collective of happiness in the U.K. in Britain .
And if you look at people on the east coast , the <unk> of the <unk> Empire , the <unk> of the <unk> Empire , put the Volvo away .
If you think about the <unk> of the United States , we 've all felt that we 're going to have some kind of <unk> attacks .
So let me summarize what we 're talking about .
I said that our ability to use this self - control is only part of our fundamental human mind .
I 've done a metaphor for you as the <unk> of our mind .
And I said , we 're all <unk> people , and this <unk> is moving from the traditional level .
When we climb into the <unk> , self - awareness of our own relationship , we do n't feel so selfish , and we feel that we seem to be better , more <unk> and understand how to be <unk> .
And there 's a very important problem with this kind of innovation that I 'm like , is that this is a design that we have developed ?
Is it the product of our hand that natural selection ?
Or , is this a little <unk> in the entire system , and it 's a religious experience at the bottom of the Big Bang , which happened when there was a political stroke that happened ?
There 's a lot of scientists who are involved in this idea .
So for example , the new <unk> thinks that religion is a series of <unk> , a certain kind of meme in our brain , and we 're doing all sorts of crazy religions .
But ultimately , " How do you have a good job for it ? "
How can any organisms learn to adapt to conservatives ?
So let me tell you .
In " Human <unk> , " Charles Darwin , wrote a lot about moral evolution , and why we have it .
And Darwin thinks that a lot of the virtues are almost impossible at us , but they 're in our groups .
And he describes a scene in which there are two early people who are elected and competitive .
And he said , " If a community has enough courage , compassion and compassion , they 're always going to be <unk> to help each other , and then this tribal success is a little bit larger .
And then he came up with this : " <unk> and <unk> people could n't be glamorous if it had n't done it . "
In other words , Charles Darwin believes this group has a theory .
But this idea is about 40 years of <unk> , but it 's going to be a very powerful evidence for the book of Tom Wilson 's book , which is a <unk> evidence , and we and other species are chosen by groups of groups .
But the right thing about thinking about this is that it 's a <unk> choice .
So let 's look at this : you 're going inside groups and groups .
That 's a group of university administrators .
There 's competition in these groups .
These people are going to compete with each other .
And the opposite of <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
These guys are only a few people who get paid .
Some of them could go into <unk> .
So in this group , the benefit of the community is actually the <unk> of <unk> .
But sometimes this is a good thing to do , because there 's one of those people trying to avoid people .
So for example , maybe he 's going to say that the <unk> of psychic <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
But when the competition is there , there is also a range of other players who are there .
Once you put these people in a boat , they do n't have any collaboration , because their interest is in the same boat .
There are only institutions they can win because they make a team .
These things are kind of <unk> , but they 're the core truth of the <unk> .
The main argument for dealing with groups for groups always happen since the crowd , to encourage groups of groups , but once once there 's a group of collaborators , they have a whole bunch of people who are willing to use these people to work with others .
Let me give you one example .
If we have a group of small organisms that might be bacterial , maybe it 's all about <unk> , it does n't care about the patterns of the system .
That 's good . They 're going to be <unk> each other , and they 're doing their job together .
You can see that in the simulation , they 're going to be able to get out of each other , growing up , when they grow two times larger , and you see how they <unk> .
But if they have a mutation in them .
This is one of the forces of <unk> , and this is a very strong move of <unk> .
It 's always more expensive .
So when you look at the green and the blue line , you find a lot more . Blue becomes smaller .
And that 's how it goes .
We 're just from one small green , when it 's in blue , and it gets independent , food and other things .
But soon , these partnerships are <unk> .
And the " Love Fox " sucks .
If a group does n't solve it , it could n't get a lot of benefits from cooperation , and groups would n't do it .
But there 's a lot of ways to solve it .
That 's not a hard question .
In fact , Nature has solved it .
The best way to use the natural world is to put everybody in the boat .
For example , why every cell in each cell has its own DNA , it 's completely separate with DNA .
And that 's because they 've always been independent bacterial bacteria , and they 're gathered together as <unk> .
And maybe a leopard is another one , and we never know why , but once they have a layer of <unk> around them , all of the labor of all sorts of labor organizations are <unk> in the same <unk> , so we 've got a super - <unk> increase in <unk> .
Now , let 's go back to this kind of <unk> , one of the <unk> groups in the love of a <unk> hitchhiking .
A very <unk> man can think about it .
This is a very powerful and effective <unk> that can use all of the resources that are able to extract from those green .
And very quickly , the population population is actually made up of these new <unk> .
I 'm here to show you some of the major changes in evolution .
There is no change in Darwin , but now there are some new things in this area , and these things look like this .
It 's not a natural shift in the natural world , but it 's just in some bacteria .
This is probably about a billion billion or six billion years ago , and when some of these lonely <unk> create a little bit , it 's very smooth , but it happens when you 're a little bit <unk> , or when it happens .
Once you get <unk> in the same district , they 're just working with partners because they are soon going to fall into other activities .
The final <unk> of <unk> won , as Darwin says .
These early <unk> eventually came up with bees and ants , and they changed the world and changed the biosphere .
And this is even more spectacular , even in the nearest 50 years , when our ancestors turned into a culture of culture , and they brought them back to the end of the <unk> , or they were able to <unk> their own body , to their dad and their God 's God .
Once they 're in the same community , they 're working together .
<unk> is the most powerful force that has never been seen before , and this is a collaborative force that can <unk> the world as well as possible .
Well , of course , the <unk> of human population <unk> .
And the rest of the population is very short , very quickly , and they 're starting to melt very quickly .
We do n't live in collaboration with bees .
In fact , what we found was that this divided in the Arab region of the Arab , we found that there was always a lot of <unk> with religious religions .
And yet , when people get together , they put them in the same activities , and they 're almost moving a hill .
Let 's look at these pictures .
Do you think they 're looking at their own interest ?
Or is it also that you 're looking at people who have lost their own self - interest into the world ?
Okay , so that 's what I 'm going to tell you about today .
Now I 'm going to show you a little bit about what I talk about today in the last three minutes .
<unk> <unk> : We have all kinds of religious experience , as philosophers famously explained .
And the most common thing is that we 've lost the secret of the <unk> , and we lose ourselves .
And this <unk> is bringing us from one of the conventional , distant ones , even higher and deeper .
We 've all got <unk> .
We have <unk> because we developed evolution from <unk> , as Darwin .
<unk> is a process of <unk> , not a mistake , and I 'm not sure , but if it 's a <unk> .
If this is a process of <unk> , then we 're evolution becoming a religious person .
I 'm not saying that we 're evolution for a big religious organization .
These are things that we 've seen recently .
I mean , we 're evolution to see things around us and then join them to become a team , and in some of the wolf 's <unk> , or even some kind of idea of thinking .
This is why politics is so connected .
The political is in one aspect of the traditional , and how much it is , but the politics is perfect .
It 's <unk> with other people .
It 's also fair to fight between good and evil , and we all believe that we are in a good achievement .
And the most important thing is , if this libertarian is real , it means the <unk> of the modern world .
Because humans , in some way , are like the <unk> of the bees .
Okay , we 're bees . We 've got <unk> from <unk> .
We broke the old system free for the old <unk> .
We 've released the imagination of the Earth 's imagination and create a lot of wealth and <unk> .
Now , we 're free as an independent bees .
But , sometimes we have all these things that we want ?
How do I spend my life ?
So what do we do ?
What do we do as a <unk> ? But the modern world , the traditional social values that we do n't have .
In this low level , it feels very ridiculous .
It 's like we 're like , " <unk> the <unk> in my house .
One of the most important challenges in our modern life is to find out the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and then doing some <unk> things , when you get into the top .
I saw my students when I was in college , and I saw this .
They want to look for a motivation or a call that can get them to find this <unk> .
They 're looking for their own <unk> .
These are all given to me because people are n't completely selfish .
Most people are concerned of trying to overcome themselves as a part of a larger organization .
And here 's a simple metaphor to explain that this particular <unk> is about 400 years ago .
People are n't the island themselves .
Everybody was part of the continent .
Thank you .

<unk> Martin : A strange world for <unk>
And what I 'm going to talk about is human figures for them , but , first , I want to tell you why I come here .
I have two reasons here . This is my two sons , Ford and <unk> .
When the Ford was about three years old , I had a very small room , a very small space .
My offices are half of the <unk> rooms , and his head is half .
It 's very crowded if you 're a writer , in the late <unk> .
So , when <unk> was born , I realized I had to give my other place .
It did n't have a lot of space in the house , so I could barely think of my yard . I did n't have a building in 3,000 dollars and some environmental materials , building this place .
All of the things that I need to do here . It 's a silence .
There 's plenty of space , and I can do it myself .
When I built this space , I said , " I 'm not the only person to build a space for myself . "
So , I did some research .
I found <unk> <unk> .
He had his own writing room .
<unk> have two <unk> of <unk> space , which is very distinctive , because he lives with his wife .
In the public culture , the <unk> have his own headquarters . Of course , <unk> has its place .
So I think I have to go out and see what people are building now .
This is the first space I found in the <unk> , in Tennessee , and also my <unk> .
From outside , it 's a very typical garage garage .
But it 's not .
And this , I think , is a very classic space .
This is the poster of the sound of <unk> , and , of course , there 's a <unk> shape , which is important .
And then I found that space is not just limited to interior .
This man is building a <unk> in his yard , and it 's in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He was in the <unk> <unk> .
This is another <unk> space , a little bit of complexity .
It was completely used in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
This is all from his owner .
That 's probably the interior of 1,000 feet .
So , in my first research , I realized that I was n't looking at what I 'd like to find , and I 've found a lot about the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> 's couch <unk> .
And of course there are some activities .
But there are some things for work for the arts , some of them are collecting things for people .
And most importantly , I was surprised to find what I found .
In this case .
From outside , the typical garage of the garage .
This is the <unk> of New York .
And the only thing that can give you a hint of the window .
There 's a house inside of 16 Japanese <unk> in Japan .
The owner came from Japan to all the details of the Japanese , and hired Japanese style for Japanese style .
This room does n't have a railway or a convenience .
All of the <unk> are <unk> and <unk> .
This is another remarkable scene . This is a <unk> in Australia .
But you 're looking at the door of a garage , and you see the size of a career .
It 's a good reason to build it .
People who build it are <unk> .
Yves <unk> won <unk> in Ireland , and he training on this space . He trained others .
On the right - hand side of the garage , he had an intimate room room , and he could get his own achievement , which is the other important component of an alternative space .
So , when this space represents someone 's career , it obviously represents a passion .
It looks like a England ship .
It had a lot of 18 centuries of <unk> to the 19th century .
It 's a museum level .
So , when I ended up traveling my journey , I found 50 .
And they were obsessed with me .
But they also left me very impressive , and they 've got a lot of <unk> to build .
And I realized that there were people who were very passionate about what they were doing .
They really loved their own career .
They 're very passionate about their <unk> and their own interest .
So they 've created these spaces to respond to what they like to do .
So , if you ca n't have your own space , I blame you , and I 'm going to go and walk .
Thank you very much .

<unk> design is a path of exploration -- it can help us to make a natural humor . David <unk> , a sociologist and a piece of a scientist from Doug Engelbart , with his paintings , including his work and <unk> .
design , exploration , humor , photography

David <unk> on design , exploration , humor
And I kept doing a lot of fun , until soon a few days ago , they said no .
So this is something that makes me more <unk> about the slides , and it 's much more good that you can adjust attention .
I have to say that we have no -- we do n't have a lot of pain -- you know , if you 're going to use <unk> , you ca n't see the <unk> <unk> from the back or the side , or the lower corner , but maybe the compromise is not going to focus , and we ca n't focus on it . We do n't care about it , so we can not pay attention to the <unk> that we 're not focused on , then we could n't concentrate at the size of the year
This is one of my ideas , a thought .
In fact , the slide is very glamorous .
And what you 're most excited about is they 're <unk> , but we 're not going to do this tonight .
So we started the first <unk> .
And this thing is , some people have convinced a decade in Portugal .
And this -- that 's my first first time -- I think -- you know , it 's going to be a little more than a night , and I look down and say , " Wow , how simplicity .
So you go to this big <unk> , just one B .
I mean , <unk> .
All of the things in the world are complex , so this big <unk> <unk> , my God , I 've taken a picture .
I thought , God , this is the cool thing I 've ever seen in my life .
Until a few months ago , I went back to the same police -- the whole thing -- I think -- and then I looked at it .
And I understood that it was just a finished door .
And I 've got the emotional <unk> and <unk> of it , and it 's the message that people have begun to read before they get to the rest of the world , how they respond to it .
The design of this area is really clear that I think it 's very obvious to me that this is very straightforward .
This is a group of a garage , and it 's the same thing on the bottom .
So this is the <unk> table . You see what it means .
You know , it 's very glamorous .
Think about the second door of the second door .
So , where do you want to go ?
Same color , same message .
And the only difference is that the emotions of the left - hand hand to the <unk> -- and think about it , which is <unk> ?
But it did n't write . It does n't have to write it .
I think I 'll stop in another room .
And I think a lot of people have found that this has become more complex in the last five years .
It becomes so simple , so it 's a little bit of a <unk> trend , which starts speaking self - expression .
But when I was in <unk> , I saw this leopard , and I found this " <unk> " even even a <unk> artist .
This <unk> artist comes up here , and it 's just a little bit more <unk> .
And he did n't like it before .
This is a book of <unk> .
I 've got a couple of photos , and this is a billboard that 's about Florida , or they do n't want to relegate this sign to the person who does n't do that , so they 're not going to make a sign that they 'd like to lock a button , so they just <unk> part of that <unk> .
And I think it 's going to make you notice more than that .
Hopefully you 're not going to get rid of those <unk> , <unk> -- <unk> " <unk> . "
This is my second book .
And the first story is , " The End of printing " and " <unk> " is another movie and Marc <unk> .
" The End of printing " is in <unk> .
And I started working with Tim <unk> , who said , " No , he does n't believe it 's the end of the print .
And then I said , okay , I 'm just hoping that you 're going to give you the film and the books , and he finally woke up .
And in the end of the film , he said , " I do n't have a lot of <unk> , and I try to try and try , but I 'm going to go and get it to a exhibition , called " <unk> : " " The End " -- and then he says , of course , this is not true . "
So , when the camera is developed , somebody says you 're going to show you , you 've got to throw it down .
And now they 're going to use the camera .
And of course , this is <unk> .
So this is " Second sight , " my name is about <unk> .
I think it 's not only the only element for design , but that 's probably the most important thing .
Everybody has a intuition .
It ca n't teach it , in fact , most of the <unk> that <unk> it in the process , because they 're not able to quantify it " <unk> Test , " which is a very difficult thing , but we 're going to make you look at the steps of commercial <unk> , or doing business .
So it becomes <unk> .
There 's a quote from Einstein , and he says , " It 's going to work on the road .
And when you get a little bit of a <unk> , it 's called it -- or whatever it is , or any name -- the answer to that is to travel , and you do n't know where it comes from .
It 's kind of like a person who says , " What is the song ?
And the more you try to figure out the answer , when you 're not going to think about it , it 's a bit of a solution to you .
And I love this for several reasons .
If you have any design , they 'll tell you that this ca n't read .
And I think the last thing you have to do is , more importantly , I feel that it 's good .
" Do n't think that 's obvious . "
One thing is clear , and it does n't mean it can communicate .
And more importantly , it does n't mean it 's the right message .
So , what was the message for people to read ?
And I think that 's a lot of times .
This is collaboration with Yves <unk> .
And I was collecting with his wife and dad , and they were collecting about 600 <unk> of <unk> , which were fantastic to predict what was going on .
This book is called " <unk> , " and it 's a different word .
It 's -- many of them have never been published -- I 've written a lot of <unk> .
This is the design of the original content .
I 've got a lot of <unk> on the page , and I 'm going to end up with the printing page of the book and <unk> it on the last 400 pages , so it 's only about five pages left .
But I decided I loved this piece of content , and I like it to feel -- so I left it .
It does n't have to work with the book , but I think it 's very nice when the central hemisphere is so good .
This is another other <unk> in the book , and there 's a couple of other people who say , " The new media is n't connected ; they 're natural . "
And the idea of <unk> and <unk> is that the concept of the <unk> , the notion of leadership , and the purpose of wisdom , as a habit of private property , has n't heard before .
" Technology technology is going to be used in the age of a long - year - old social society , <unk> <unk> . "
" When people <unk> to create a new world , they still look at the world . "
I hate this stuff , a little bit .
" In the age of the <unk> , there are no other conditions in the world , except it does n't have any jobs . "
And so that 's what he thinks is the choice . This is true .
This is one project for <unk> <unk> .
And I put it out because it looks like it 's about nine years later , and this is what it is .
And I found that there was a fishing shelter in my house when I bought the house in L.A. 's house .
There 's a few ice attacks that happened in the late hemisphere during the ' 80s .
And I asked the people who were just the ones who had just heard about what he was , and he said , " That 's the rain . "
Okay , so I said , I 've never seen it .
And I ended up on the bottom , and I saw this old , old circle , <unk> circles and <unk> .
And the amazing thing about it is that it 's made of a very cheap metal metal , which is completely <unk> , surrounded by the water , and the spider .
And then I went down , and what did they do ?
How do you think it 's concrete or anything ?
But when I did it , I made a <unk> <unk> plate , and I 've been doing it with smart glasses , so it could have been used . I 'm ready .
This is one of the experiments that did this , to give a coach , and we made a bunch of six people trying to figure out the print as a media medium for people online .
So this is a bunch of <unk> .
I 've got this photo , using a different method .
And on top of it , if you want to look at the <unk> picture -- I think that 's the process of surfing -- to get into the website .
I think a lot of surfers are running to the site to see the photos of <unk> .
I do n't get statistics , so I 'm not going to tell you that .
I do n't have the website , just this one .
This is an organization in New York , called " <unk> <unk> , " called " <unk> <unk> . "
It 's been <unk> in New York , and it 's <unk> .
You ca n't , that , you do n't see -- but it 's something that 's really a little bit better .
It said , " If a leopard artist can <unk> , we can . " But I do n't know .
And those are <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and you know , I 'm sure , " Hey , <unk> . "
It 's done very well .
It does n't look like some , you know , that 's what it looks like .
A poster for the <unk> of the Pacific , a school in Florida .
This is a particularly magical thing that I found recently .
When I was in Christmas , I had no interest in this period , and this stage was n't glamorous -- but people had this demand -- and they had the skin <unk> <unk> .
This is either the old <unk> , a new <unk> or a whole new product , and I ca n't think , well , how do you do that ?
I went to work in the world , and I 'm going to show you that this is a new way of designing a <unk> .
I think this is an ongoing solution .
This is a student who 's going to get rid of the <unk> and the restaurants and all the shops in the shops and the restaurants I 've never seen .
I was working for <unk> years ago .
It 's a global brands , a global <unk> .
That 's interesting , I 'm about to learn <unk> ; no instruction training sometimes sometimes people say , but it 's a funny experiment , because there 's no fun experiment for me to sell them to improve their <unk> .
They assumed that they hate themselves .
I found that this was true for me .
To give you a little bit of human nature , I have a copy of the ad and the people who do n't have the ads , so nobody remember it .
We 're going to tell you about the consumer , and there 's still a lot of people who have friends who have friends , and they have families who live in their family .
Our billboards are <unk> , " Thank God .
So what we 're trying to do is try to take a -- the <unk> of the limb , these guys , the " <unk> <unk> , " and they know , <unk> become a good , not reject .
You know , " Thank you , I have to go back to a big -- <unk> , gray job , and the gray ones are listening to each other .
But anyway , this is one of my most <unk> ads , because it looks like a girl who looks looking at the computer .
<unk> : " <unk> <unk> . " And the software interface is jumping .
This ad project came out .
But the German <unk> did a little bit of change , not telling me , because it 's going to make you look at what changed you .
This is the winner of the world , <unk> , the <unk> of the world .
There are two questions .
If you want to put a <unk> in the ads , you get alive .
I 'm always going to make sure that this is a week and you 've got a week .
And he 's very grateful for that project , so you can see ...
And that <unk> explained to me that this change , for example , is that we do n't have <unk> ; why do n't we put <unk> into advertising ? "
And I learned that their logic is , I 'm completely anti - <unk> , and the world is obviously a little bit more connected , so I 've sure that German people can get a black <unk> in front of a computer .
This is some of the pieces of <unk> magazine .
This magazine is going to read in front of you , hear music , try to read it .
There are no <unk> , no systems , without <unk> .
This is from Brian Berners - Mart , which is exactly what we 're arguing about .
<unk> stars talk about their <unk> <unk> .
The good news is a lot of paper .
And I was fortunate to find a teacher sitting in the book .
Talk about Brian <unk> -- that 's really boring -- so I used to use <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
You can look at it , and you turn it into a <unk> or something .
And I believe you can eventually <unk> it , but really , really bad .
And after doing a lot of magazine , I 'm very interested in how to deal with the big news news , and I 'm very interested in looking at what 's called " <unk> " and " The ' 60s . "
And they 've been very upset about what they 're looking for , and what we 've seen is that we 've seen a moment of <unk> .
I think the " Vagina magazine " is probably the best one .
It 's a very exciting one -- the <unk> plane is going to hit and do n't get much more glamorous , and if it 's really interesting , it ca n't be -- I mean , I 'm talking about this cover , " <unk> or " the ' 50s " or ' <unk> . "
But when I flick the " <unk> , " some of the stuff is <unk> .
On the left , we see people die or <unk> .
And the content on the right - hand side tells us a new approach to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> did n't have because of <unk> events .
And if you look at this picture of this lady -- who knows what she 's going to do right now -- and the <unk> on the right -- " He always knows how to make me excited . "
Yeah , the husband does n't get rid of the building . It 's -- unfortunately , it 's a little bit more <unk> , and maybe it 's a rock .
These are all spread across the Web .
Nothing happened .
" <unk> <unk> . "
There 's a lot of kids who are <unk> in this day , and there are <unk> bears .
And I think even if you 're going to take a piece of paper , it 's better than that .
This is probably impossible : two ladies , two women , all <unk> .
One -- who can feel her pain ; another <unk> is <unk> and milk and milk .
And then there 's a couple of months later that I did a lecture in New York , and a man came out of me and told me -- they were email by email -- and they 'd like to go back to the <unk> of the car , when they go home , they thought that maybe they 're going to be going back in the shadow of 9/11 , to come back from the 9/11 of September .
That 's what they found .
It 's a very bad thing to find in the car , and it does n't mean that we 're coming back .
This is my desktop computer .
There 's a guy who tells me a little bit about it , and I do n't know what it is .
These are the key things that I 'm talking about -- maybe some kind of relationship to me .
We get closer .
And I 'm seeing it at the beginning of the plane , as a consequence .
I do n't know whether it 's an improvement or a bad idea , because if you 're in a helmet , you can do it in the keyboard , and then you ca n't get out of it .
Now there 's a plate , and it 's very , very convenient to be able to do it , just to <unk> .
I do n't think that 's progress .
If you recognize the power of <unk> , the regular <unk> says , " Hitler confuse . "
This is a very extreme case for emotion , which is the power of emotions , even though it 's a cruel <unk> .
What about the next ?
And when we 're more connected to the importance of technology , it seems to be more important .
You have to be on your personality .
Nobody can do that : No , no use of your life , your parents , nurturing , live .
If you do that , it 's really the only way to create a unique piece of work , and you 're going to love your job .
And this -- I love " Art " ; they 're not going to get this piece of work .
A woman came out of her head to her toes .
It 's a good thing -- she gives " friendly " -- maybe she 's called " <unk> <unk> " or " Better <unk> . "
But more importantly , she 's going to get 20 dollars a year .
So I thought , yeah , good , I 'm going to get involved in 20 bucks .
I imagine people <unk> the sea , and I would say , " Well , you 're going to tell you , oh , thank you so much , that if you have the sea ice cap , you have to say that if that 's the wrong thing .
And I 'm sure she does n't find any <unk> , because I <unk> <unk> .
A few years ago , I was invited to speak at the conference of the conference .
The theme is the courage , those people called me a flat designer .
And I was stunned to see one photo of my dad , which was a test pilot , and he told me that when you were a testing pilot and told you about 40 to 50 percent , you 'd be proud of it .
This is a high estimate of most professional professionals .
But you know , governments built a plane ; they say , can you see it ? Are you willing to go ?
Somebody went ; somebody did n't .
And I started thinking about what I had to do .
And most of the time , these are n't going to happen .
So why do n't you do experiments ? Why not ?
Why do n't you put your personality out ?
And when I went to my mouth , I always ask a good job of what the <unk> was doing ?
As a teacher , you 've heard the answer , and you 're going to give the answer to the answer .
I 've heard the best -- I 'm sure some of you have heard -- well , the definition of work is : if you 're going to lose it -- is n't it ?
And if you will , your job is great .
If you do n't , what are you doing ?
What happened to you ?
Thank you .

<unk> : Well , <unk> : " What 's going to happen ? "

Kevin <unk> on how technology evolve
I do n't know how you think , but I did n't understand what technology meant to my life .
I 've spent the last year thinking about it .
Do I need technology ? Am I going to <unk> it ?
Am I going to be <unk> ? Same thing to me , the latest thing about me .
But on the other hand , I gave me all of the collection of my own forces , and 3,000 miles across the United States , the force itself , most of them ate <unk> cake and junk food .
<unk> , I tried to keep it further than technology , trying to <unk> my life .
And at the same time , I went to a <unk> website , and I introduced a paper to the newest technology .
So I 'm still interested in what 's really the true meaning of technology , and it relates to the relationship with the human relationship , with spiritual relationships .
I do n't even know what technology is .
There 's one first insight for technology .
This is one of the first ways that I found the word " technology . "
It appeared in a very short place in the <unk> , " Design art " and " use of art . "
And that , obviously , is that technology does n't exist , but obviously technology is there .
I love a definition of <unk> for technology .
And he says , that technology is invented after you 're born .
But it covers a lot of things we talked about .
Danny Hillis is actually a projection -- he says , " Technology is n't going to use anything .
And I think this is true for us .
But I 'm also interested in another definition of technology .
And it goes again to something else .
And even more importantly , when I try to understand it , I suddenly found a way to see this problem , and it seems to me explore the demand of the question .
I talked about it first .
So this is a distant attempt to say .
And the question I get is that this question , what is it that does n't mean that it 's not going to make chocolate or yogurt , and I 'm talking about it ?
And in the entire <unk> of the whole <unk> , it 's a way of thinking about it : Think about biology .
Richard <unk> 's technique is : <unk> them as genes , genes .
So , what about the gene ? The <unk> gene .
So I said , well , if we look at our cultural world , what is it about technology ?
Obviously , this is a very widespread problem , like <unk> as a gene is not unique .
But it 's still a fair story . So , I 'm going to try and say , well , what if we do that for technology ?
And I think , once we ask this question , we have to come back to life , because , obviously , if we go back the roots of technology , I believe it will go from a certain way .
So I 'm going to start with my little <unk> .
As you heard earlier , we do n't really know the life of life on Earth .
We really have no idea .
Sylvia <unk> is a great advocate of <unk> - <unk> .
And the work of Brian <unk> is also trying to find all the species on Earth .
One thing we should do is to look at the <unk> of the Earth , looking at a random lens on the lens , see what life is . If we use Mars <unk> , we do n't see a lot of amazing species on Earth .
This is not another planet , this is what 's happening on our planet .
This is a ant , and it 's going to work on the <unk> .
Each of these organisms , as you 've seen from the Grand Canyon , and all these amazing things , they 're all embedded in the rules of changing life .
I do n't have <unk> biology , which is no exception for any organism .
One of the things that we want to do -- if you 've heard a little bit about the habit , you 'll know , no matter what we 're talking about , it 's all about life , because every one of them is in a part of it .
This is the sun ice cap . It 's glamorous that it integration <unk> , when it 's in the body .
It 's another one . This is the Grand Canyon . That 's where it 's in the bottom , the blue , which is an larvae , does n't kill the <unk> of the <unk> .
These are all <unk> , and if we look at the same form of life , it 's about six continents , six actors in the world , with six <unk> : the plants , the animal , animals , <unk> and <unk> .
This is a way of looking at life , and it 's the way this is a way of looking at Earth 's life .
But the other thing that 's really interesting , if you look at it , is to see it in terms of evolution .
There 's a evolution of evolution , and it 's not linear ; we 're going to fall from the center .
That 's the most primitive thing in the center , which is the Earth 's life , all of the same six types of life .
When you 've seen the species , you see us in <unk> .
I like this , because it shows that every organism on Earth is evolving .
These sequences and bacteria and humans are evolving .
And they 're all over the same way , and it 's going to work that way .
But we see , every single thing is in <unk> , and the way it 's going to live in the <unk> .
If we look at our life , if we start talking about evolution ? We see a bunch of things .
One thing that evolution does is that the Earth does n't have life on it .
And what we found is that the core of life is in every long period of long , long distances -- there 's bacterial ice .
Life <unk> , it never <unk> . It 's all over the place .
There are more lives on Earth who live on life on the Earth 's life .
And the other thing we saw is diversity . We also see <unk> .
And what we see is that cells tend to move into a lot of different sorts of cells .
And we obviously clearly see them complexity .
In fact , we have data shows that the data is actually becoming more complex .
I 'm going to talk about <unk> <unk> .
One of the things that we see in life is that it 's grown up in the outside , and there 's a lot more life , which is the whole system of life .
As those <unk> cells -- they 're all covered with other lives .
They do n't get into the inside . There are more things evolving .
So , evolution is about five : five , diverse , special , complex , social and social , and I 've taken this idea , saying , well , what about technology ?
And then I asked , what is technology ?
So obviously , I found that it was evolving .
And here we see the average <unk> , the <unk> and the downs of time change .
There are obviously diversity . Lots of stuff .
This is all a Japanese family .
I 'm going to give her a <unk> to her , and I want her to look around the summer last summer and see how many of the species in our house .
And the result is <unk> .
I did research , and I found that there was only about about eight or eight subjects in the U.K.
And he 's England , and that 's the whole wealth of England in England .
So we see a lot of diversity diversity .
This is the photo of the <unk> of <unk> , and it 's a shot of what he saw in his machine . It 's very sad !
Well , this is where we go : the world machine .
New technology is just composed of other technologies .
Most of the machines are going to interact with other technologies than opposed to other technologies , or even life .
Three , the <unk> of <unk> , complexity , and I 'm happy to say , I 'll give you a responsibility for that .
So the main trend of technology , actually , is like biology , and we see the same trend towards the common , diverse , social , complex , that may not be big , because if we draw a different type of evolution , you can actually track different types of patterns .
And I think , in fact , technology is the <unk> of life .
And what it does is , it 's so similar that we can think of it as a <unk> in the world .
So it 's <unk> in the upper on the top of the animal , and if you do that , we 'll find -- we 're essentially going to use technology .
This is Doug Engelbart , and he talked about <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , he draws <unk> .
He had the largest collection of the world -- about 500 .
And he decided to make them look like a <unk> or a snail , and it 's <unk> , trying to figure them out in time .
This is his chart , not completely open .
But the most interesting part of this is that if you look at the upper red line , it 's basically a <unk> <unk> generation , and nobody has no idea yet .
When you do something , you ca n't get to the next generation .
But in technology it 's going to happen . It 's very distinctive , you can see the scar system , which is a system that thinks that this system is technological .
In fact , the idea of belief is very important , so I started thinking about how old technology is .
Well , in fact , technology does n't die .
And I said to a scientific <unk> , who said , " Well , do n't you ?
They have disappeared . They 're in fact .
They 're not only in either , you can buy a new part of the car .
This website has been sold to a new part of a whole bunch of <unk> cars , and what I like to do is that it 's going to be able to cut down the button -- and you can buy it . I mean , that 's somebody who sells .
So I started thinking , maybe this is just a unique story .
Maybe I 'm going to do something more conservative .
And I took the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and I picked up the page -- did n't have any chosen -- I 'm going to make it a little bit more difficult because a lot of page is building , but I 've chosen this page : How many of you are building ?
Not <unk> . I 'm going to know how much they 're building .
The answer is all .
They 're building . So you can buy corn <unk> .
I do n't know who corn is <unk> .
That 's corn <unk> -- you 're still buying <unk> , <unk> tags , all of these things are n't glamorous . These are -- they 're going to be able to do it , and you can go online and get a new approach . So , it 's a technique .
In fact , you 've got 50 dollars per year in the <unk> of 50 million dollars a year .
It 's a short <unk> <unk> , 50 dollars per year . In fact , it 's not going to happen .
It 's not just resurrection ; it 's all there .
And in <unk> <unk> , <unk> was doing <unk> until 20 years ago , it was a good thing to do .
Even when we try to give a technology , it 's very hard .
We all heard about <unk> <unk> .
We 've heard about Japanese people to <unk> .
And we heard about this and that , but I went back to finding some of the examples that I found in history , where it started in place , and then I tried to figure out what was going on , because they 're always coming back . And it 's very , very <unk> .
It 's what makes sense .
And when we do that , we 're trying to take this culture of the <unk> of life , and we found that every single time in life -- life <unk> -- they 're actually accelerating and changing evolution .
They actually change the way it is .
So , the steps of evolution are basically evolving evolve .
So , in life progress , new ways of making new ideas , the new methods are increasing . Really skill is what you 're developing to explore .
And what we see here is the <unk> of <unk> and other people -- he thinks that technology is accelerating .
It 's getting rid of the way we think .
So , if you have life , life is a <unk> , and the players who live together , evolution is changing the way that play rules to play .
And the technology is really , really better evolution .
That 's what we 're arguing about .
It 's the definition of a game game . Highly <unk> is going to win .
I believe that technology is essentially a cosmic force .
The origins of technology is not the beginning of <unk> , actually , in the <unk> Big Bang , which is a huge amount of moment on Earth , and the whole universe is exploded in a little bit of a small quantum , so it 's not possible for any difference .
That 's the definition . There is no temperature .
There 's no difference . And in <unk> <unk> , the difference is different .
So , when it spread , we 're going to have a difference , and we might have different things , diversity , selection , opportunity , possibilities , or freedom .
That 's basically the same thing .
That 's what we 're doing .
Technology has brought us : options , or freedom .
It 's the essence of technology , which is the progress of progress .
So , when we paste <unk> , we hold the <unk> <unk> .
So we continue to take technology -- because we 're going to do things . These things are good .
<unk> , free , choice , possibilities .
Every time we make a new opportunity , we 're going to build a lot more new new ones .
And I think this is really important because if you can imagine the <unk> of the Republican Technology , it 's much more costly .
Imagine the technology of a cheap <unk> technology .
Suppose the <unk> had been born in the film .
There are a couple of hundred kids who are born in their self - expression and self - expression .
We have a moral commitment to technology that has the potential to contribute to the real potential of the planet .
We need to have the individual .
That 's what technology really needs .
I 'm going to jump through some <unk> statements because I do n't know why the forests are .
I do n't know why , at least it 's a little bad technology , I 'm not sure how this is going to make us dignity , and I just recommend it , because it is very close to life , maybe we can take control of it .
And maybe , in some way , we try to do something about a good home for technology .
It 's a terrible thing in <unk> spray , but good side of the side is to kill millions of deaths from it .
People are actually based on technology .
All of us think we like to be <unk> by technology . This is the limit game .
We talked about this .
See , technology is evolving .
It 's a method to explore that possible , and create more .
It 's actually a way of dealing with games , playing games .
That 's the technology .
So , when I think about what technology is , it 's about everybody who 's here , and I believe that there 's a task that everybody has a job .
That 's essentially the nature of the <unk> game .
If you 're playing good , you 'll have other people , games will increase and continue , even if you leave .
That 's the <unk> game . Technology is a flying balloon .
So I think we need to embrace technology because it 's our journey of self - organize .
Thank you .

At the time , underwater <unk> had spent decades of time with the oceans , as a great speaker , who shares the awe of the ocean , and it 's the politics of our planet , the <unk> of his planet .

<unk> <unk> : My garage .
I was obsessed with an octopus that was in my childhood .
I 'm in the middle of my mailbox . I think there are some of you who have been there , right ? There 's a lot of money on the river , and it 's made this beautiful statement .
There 's a rich river that 's filled on the top of this <unk> , and it 's all over the corner of the ice , from the Grand Canyon , all sorts of birds singing at the <unk> , singing all the birds singing .
There is absolutely no magic trick if you 're a kid who 's a vegetarian .
This is a trick that goes into the <unk> ice stream , and eventually the Gulf of Mexico ends up .
I remember that when I first approached King , I was six years old .
I was swimming in the Gulf , looking at the surface of the ice .
And so I went to the bottom of the dive , and I was struck by this speed of speed , the power and the <unk> .
And it 's in my <unk> looking at search for my hands , and I go down my hands .
And I was completely fascinated by this fabulous <unk> .
And then it 's a little bit more relaxed in my <unk> , and I 'm going to make a different color , like it will be folded .
And when I look at it , it 's going to be <unk> into the body , and the entire body produces a <unk> , which has two white <unk> on it .
And I thought , " Oh my God ! " I 'm still doing this funny thing .
And so I decided that it was time for me to get rid of it , so I would put it back .
This is actually left my hand , and it 's the most amazing thing that I 've ever left . It stops .
At the moment , six years old , I realized that I wanted to understand more biology . I did it .
And I went to university , and I had a degree of biology in the ocean to continue to get involved in <unk> .
As a student , I was in the <unk> in Hawaii .
There 's a lot of <unk> in this aquarium , but not so many <unk> , so I think , as a fan fans , I want to collect these fantastic creatures that I 've spent a long time in my students , and they 're going to bring them here in the age of a student .
Despite the fish they look at , but they do n't really interact with us .
But the ray is there .
If you go to a <unk> octopus , especially nobody in the morning morning , the octopus would <unk> look at you , and you would guess , " It really is looking at me ? It 's really just looking for me ! "
And when you go to the bottom of the <unk> , you 'll notice that these paintings are different . Some of them like to <unk> their place , and other things are <unk> behind the rock , which is the most special , a single , very special , a particular one .
When I went down to the <unk> , he was <unk> my eyes .
So when I came up in front of the <unk> , it was only about three inches thick , and this is a ray of ice that was covered on a little rock , which was <unk> down on the bottom of a piece of rock .
So I had to look at it from about six inches of this animal , which was the same animal that was so close to it , until I watch my hand , when I looked at my hands .
At the time we have each other , it 's <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> up to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the filter system , [ <unk> ] <unk> .
And then she gets rid of it , and the other one 's going to <unk> them up -- and it 's <unk> -- " <unk> , " the sound of <unk> , " <unk> . "
And then she went into a leopard , and I had a <unk> .
And then it <unk> another other pair of arms .
And I realized that I would never be an octopus in this game , because I had only two arms , and it was still <unk> .
But what I want to tell you is that it 's a very complex behavior that 's been playing , and this is a really complex act of behavior .
And the interesting thing about this , in my 30-year three years , has happened , and it changed my life .
A soldier in the aquarium came to me with my couple of friends to go to South Asia , for him to collect some animals , when we 're ready to take two 16 glasses per pound .
And he said , " Let 's shoot this exploration . "
Okay , a couple of biologist <unk> to film a movie -- this must be very interesting . And then we did this , and we 've taken a film , although it might be a nice movie , but I think it 's fun .
And I remember the brain , and I thought , " Wait a minute .
Maybe I could never have this job .
Well , I want to become a photographer . "
So I went out of the journey , and I was left with the <unk> <unk> , which I never told you about what happened to me when I did n't know what I was doing .
This is a fabulous experience .
And of course , everything I learned in school was really good for me .
As a <unk> photographer , you need to go to the field of the grass , especially their lives , and the knowledge of learning , in school , is learning how to tell me about the evolution of animals .
But I started to understand squid that when you shot them , you have to spend a lot of time and look at them .
I remember that I had once once to go to Australia , to an island called <unk> .
In fact , the evolution of the rainforest is very fast , and if it comes to the name , because I can bet that the island is at least <unk> when we get there .
<unk> is in a beautiful coral .
In fact , there 's a quarter - year - old day that 's 95 times a day .
There 's a beauty of coral reefs , a lot of animal chains , including lots of scanners .
And , in Australia , the <unk> species are not unique , but they 're not glamorous .
In fact , there 's one .
So our first task is to find them , that 's a challenge .
And our idea is that we just just came up with this month , and I hope that these animals adapt to us . And so we can look at their behavior in the next month .
And so the first week we spent a lot of time is to move closer to them , and a little bit of a little bit , a little bit .
And so you can know where they feel nervous , and you have to have a couple of hours to live .
And the first week they ignore us .
They might say , " Well , I do n't feel like anything , but they 're not going to hurt me . "
So the thing that 's going to do is start with the <unk> of the ice , and we 've got to look at them close to <unk> and combat this .
And I remember one of the most amazing images of this , at least , is their diet .
They use all sorts of different skills to help them , especially their <unk> vision .
They notice that a coral <unk> is about two feet long and start moving there .
And I do n't know whether they saw a <unk> crab , or a leopard , but , anyway , they got rid of the coral , and then they 're going to end up in this coral reef and <unk> it to the underside of that coral .
As soon as the crab touches these <unk> , it breaks down .
I always wanted to know what happened in the <unk> .
So we came up with a method for <unk> , and this is the first time I saw that they used to feed their famous <unk> .
Very impressive .
If you want to take a series of articles on different animals , you might also need to choose a very common animal .
It 's a <unk> , and they 're <unk> .
They live in <unk> .
I do n't want to admit to you why I 'm going to fall on the sea , but anyway , I love diving .
It 's like starting a new journey .
If you 're willing to get rid of what you 've never seen , get a chance to recognize something that has never been seen before , and it 's going to go into a dive .
You 're wearing your toes , and you cut yourself down , you open the flow of the ground , it breaks out of your breath .
<unk> down , it 's a world that does n't interact with the ground , except in special radio signals .
And when you 're diving in the sea , the water goes off .
Very nice everywhere .
You feel great .
And as you go down , the blue blue is getting more <unk> .
And eventually , it turned out to be a kind of <unk> , a hundred feet long after a thousand feet .
And you 're diving in the middle of the sea .
You 've got a lot of examples about the biodiversity of the ocean .
And enough of you can say , well , the most pessimistic and most advanced animals in the world are living here .
But what we know is that it 's about 95 percent of the ice we have on Earth , and I think more special <unk> .
And in the middle of the ocean , it 's a huge mountain , 40 miles long , and it 's the entire Earth .
They 're a huge amount of <unk> , hundreds of feet tall , and some of them have been <unk> over tens of thousands of ft .
The ice on this hill is forming a <unk> .
And when you 're diving in front of you , you will come to a very stimulating place because there 's thousands of <unk> in the theory , and it 's all about 40 feet , all over the scale .
When these <unk> <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> will be <unk> out of those tubes , so you can see it in front of you .
And in their top is three square kilometers of water in the top , and it 's a huge amount of pressure to keep the water into the center of the Earth , until it comes up to the earth and they 're going to be surrounded by <unk> , which is <unk> and <unk> the surface of <unk> water , just like <unk> <unk> .
In fact , this area is like the whole <unk> <unk> .
It 's about 600 to 700 pounds of <unk> .
And there 's only half of the water flowing around .
So it 's immediately squeezed down all the stuff that goes through all of the material , and the thing that 's going to be <unk> is made up of <unk> .
This is something that creates <unk> and <unk> , and they have 10 , 20 feet tall .
And over the edge of those <unk> , it 's the <unk> of life .
You 've already heard of all the <unk> <unk> around the place , and all of a sudden you 've got a hundred feet long .
These are the beautiful red tubes on these <unk> .
It 's a whole full <unk> full of seals , like shrimp , fish , chips , <unk> and <unk> beef , and they 're doing very dangerous games at the negotiating table and cold water .
The whole ecosystem did n't know until until <unk> .
It 's completely irrelevant before that .
<unk> scientists to think of the origin of life on Earth .
And in discovery , the core of the Earth , all of life , has been thought of depend on the sun , depend on sun .
But at the depth of the sea , there 's no sunlight , so it does n't exist . It 's a very short environment , life , life is so short .
When you take this incredible deep deep ocean , you feel like you 're wearing the other planet .
But it 's in the Earth , and this is really amazing .
But if you come to the age of eight , it 's probably going to be completely dead .
There are no water <unk> .
All of the creatures disappeared , but it 's still a fabulous marketing town there , a funny , chaotic , silent <unk> , no life .
But over the course of the 10 miles ...
So , Jesus ! There 's another volcano in <unk> .
And there 's a whole new <unk> of life that has ever been developed .
This life expectancy of life is about 30 to 40 years in all these <unk> .
There 's no real difference in the natural world that I 've ever seen before , and it does n't really have the difference between the world of 35 years of life .
And when you shoot a very nice swimming container .
And after that , back to home , you think , " That 's good , I see them .
Well , I know where I can shoot .
This is really a beautiful bay , a lot of technology and all sorts of creatures . "
When you 're not born , they die .
No coral , no algae , sea ice becomes cloudy .
And you think , " What 's going on ? "
When you circle around , you see there 's a <unk> , and it 's the <unk> and the grief and the <unk> are coming back .
It 's going to be on a shelf there .
This is the Gulf here .
It 's often coming in .
So the <unk> fell in the ice , <unk> the sediment of the temple , allowing the coral to kill them .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , from the Gulf of ice , killed all of the larvae and micro - animals , and the <unk> of <unk> had a huge amount of damage to the sea , which made the ice <unk> in the dark .
But the challenge is , I 've noticed some good phenomena .
I went to an <unk> bay .
And I was looking at it as bad as it was , and I went to the other side of the island .
And five years later , I went back to this place , and she was a nice beach . She was really nice .
They 're all alive , and all of a sudden is the fish and fish tree , you have to ask , " What 's going on ? "
This is all from the local community .
And they realized that everything was happening in the <unk> , and it was going to stop the policy of <unk> and <unk> to responsibility and responsibility for responsibility that had to go through the rock and get rid of the ice and also <unk> the corn of ice , so that the bay came into the metal .
The ocean has incredible capacity to self - repair , if we give it to it .
I do n't think I 'm going to let me go .
She says a few people who have ideas can change the world .
Indeed , this is a truth .
This is a group of people who had an idea change that had changed the window .
I 'm really sure that the power of ordinary people .
And I 've been involved in a lot of talk about a couple of questions that people come up with at the end of the talk , " But what can I do ?
I 'm just one person , and I only have one person .
And those are the things that are so big and global , and it seems to be <unk> . "
It 's a really good problem .
And my answer is not to think of them as a huge , <unk> global problem .
You can see them in your own position .
<unk> look at your mind .
What you really care about is not the place where you live .
And we started doing it .
It 's a kind of a place where you 're going to be able to create something that goes around and encourage people to do this .
Maybe these are the little conditions that can be created in the map .
In fact , communication technology in the world , <unk> Alaska , can soon immediately know what happened in China , and what do you do ?
Everybody can talk to the people who are talking to each other , and we 're not going to figure out what 's going on on the map .
This is the kind of system that 's going to start growing , and it 's possible to get a little bit more .
This is my answer to this question .
Just stand up in your own position , think about you , to look at yourself .
How do you get the responsibility for what you 're doing ?
That 's how it goes .
The animals who live in their lives are n't going to live for themselves , so they have no , but we can .
From the theory , we can think of it .
We can change the way that we 're going to influence the environment , as those of those who make the windows old .
<unk> talks about the TED Prize , and what we do is we can do anything that can be done , to stop , instead of <unk> the ocean , she 's called " <unk> , " and she called them hope .
I did this for this proposition .
I hope that the hope is that <unk> can notice the depth of the ocean , that a history of history has been ignored .
I think one <unk> , <unk> the ocean , and if there 's a bunch of big and poisonous junk , you throw them into the sea .
But today , I hope we can really care about our deep sea .
I 'm not telling you , but I promised that I 'm going to give you a wish to support the <unk> .
I 'll do that .
Thank you .

New York , <unk> <unk> shows a group of <unk> who studied modern life , and she talked about how a woman gives women to change some rules .
art , comedy , culture , humor , media , peace , women
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : In humor , through humor
I was worried about women .
Not that I 'm not worried now , but I 've learned <unk> .
I have learned about biology .
In fact , I learned some interesting things to help me do this fear .
So let me explain .
Back in the ' 80s , in my ' 70s , my young sister should be good , <unk> cute , soft and <unk> . We need to adapt to this <unk> pattern , and what should we look like ?
There are many women around us .
As our mother , our <unk> , my sister , of course , is ubiquitous , as well as the media , to <unk> the photos and words that we need to become a girl .
My mother was very different .
She 's a young man , but I did n't have to get women to do what women were doing . She was n't bought for me .
She knew what I needed , she bought my cartoon books .
I could n't read books .
I also draw painting , since I know my cartoon can be accepted , I can paint it , and I 'm going to do something about what I do n't do , but I have n't really good enough to talk about it ; I still have a <unk> .
And then I went as a cartoonist .
When we are young , we do n't always know -- we know about girls , but we 're not aware -- and we ca n't be able to do this in the world , even though we 've been born on these women , who are taught that the most important colors in our world is to teach us what 's going on ?
What should we be taught ?
What do we do ? How do you make a girl ?
And what I 'm going to talk about is the kind of rules that are constantly monitor .
We get stuck , because women are traditional <unk> , so the ground looking at the ground .
We put the traditional <unk> again .
We do n't even save the idea of what we expect .
And in those rules , they change .
We do n't know what happens after a long time , and it makes us very vulnerable .
Now , if you do n't like these rules , most people do not like those principles , and I know that I 'm not going to do that , even if I get rid of those rules -- and there 's no way to realize that the rules are in the <unk> , but what is better than that .
comics depend on social tradition .
You know , cartoons comes from us , and we start organizing .
<unk> comes from our behavioral code and we love that comics are unexpected , and it will spell it .
So what if you add women and comics ?
I think you get change .
Because women are in the ice , and we know traditional traditions , we can make different sound .
And I started painting in many chaos .
I grew up in <unk> .
Over the course of the experience , a series of events , <unk> <unk> , under the next few days , I think I 'm drawing , I think , what 's going on .
And then my family fell into chaos , and I tried to paint it to keep our family together , trying to make family sacrifice .
But it does n't work .
My parents bought , my sister was arrested .
But I found myself .
I found that I did n't wear <unk> <unk> , I was n't wearing a <unk> . I felt right .
When I was 20 years old , I found that very few women were doing comics .
I thought , " Okay , maybe I can break the rules ceiling . " I did it ; I became a cartoonist .
And I thought , I started thinking , " Well , why do n't I do something ?
And I often love political comics , and why do n't I create political literature to think about these stupid rules , who are also Hitler ? "
My point is to be typical -- my view is typical <unk> .
I ca n't change . I 've lived here .
Even when I went traveling , I was like a American woman .
But I think the rules that I talked about is <unk> , of course , that every culture has its own sense of what it is , and each woman has to do the same principles , as we 're in the United States .
And so ...
Women , because we 're in the middle , we understand the traditional tradition .
We have incredible things .
Now my job is to collaborate with the international cartoonist , and I love this experience . It gives me a larger space to express the truth , quickly and simplicity .
Not only that , but cartoons can make a difference , not just in intellectual , <unk> , in the psyche .
And my job is to collaborated with women from women , and they come from Saudi Arabia , Iran , Turkey , <unk> , French , France , who talked about what we 're facing .
These women are trying to work in some very tough situations , let 's hear the sound of the world .
I was fortunate to work with them .
How do we think about how powerful women are so powerful because we 're vulnerable to the role of our women as traditional <unk> , we can have a huge amount of change .
I think , I do n't believe that every time we change these things , we 're all <unk> .
Thank you .

Physicist Brian <unk> found out a lot of mathematical laws of art -- the <unk> of the city -- wealth , volunteers , <unk> and other areas , and all the other people in the cities are <unk> by a number of <unk> , which is the same law that we think about the world .

Patrick <unk> : The magic math in the city
Cities are civilizations .
They 're constantly expanding the expansion of the past 200 decades since the last 200 years , and it 's going to be <unk> across the Earth .
Cities is the bedrock of global warming pollution , which is caused by the eco - <unk> economy -- these problems are made by cities .
This is the origin of all these questions .
We feel more sustainable , as well as the tsunami , and those problems are actually the effects of the rise of <unk> <unk> .
Let 's see a couple of numbers .
There are n't 200 years of <unk> in the U.S.
This is now more than <unk> .
It 's over 50 years since the global <unk> .
China is building 300 new new cities in the future .
And notice every week in the future , it will be a hundred million people into our cities .
It will have a impact on everything .
And if you 've always been alive , you have to have the effects of <unk> .
But the city is <unk> , but it 's the way cities solve it .
And this is because cities are <unk> and <unk> , all of the creative people who make ideas , creative innovation , etc .
We have this kind of stuff .
We do need the scientific principles of the city .
These are my <unk> guys .
And those brilliant people do these jobs , and I 'm just going to tell you a little bit about that .
There 's a question that we want to do .
By 2050 , 10 billion people on the planet want to live in this place like this , where they do n't realize that they 're going to do this kind of stuff .
The problem is <unk> London and New York , and it 's like this .
That 's a problem .
And I have to say a lot of that , which seems to be more likely to look like what they 're talking about .
And I 'm going to say that we 're not going to make a <unk> of a <unk> city .
The science theory suggests that it 's a very broad <unk> principle , which we can make a unified structure .
This is our goal .
Is this possible ?
Is there a general law ?
When I think about it , two questions happened in my mind .
First city is part of life ?
Is it a big whale ?
Is it a horse ?
Is Microsoft a big <unk> ?
So what do we do ?
We can use the DNA of a company with a city of the city , and so these are all <unk> <unk> or so on .
What if you 're based on the city ?
You can <unk> a bomb and get 30 years later .
<unk> cities are <unk> .
All the companies will sit down .
If you get to account for the interview , you should be able to predict what 's going on .
This is a picture of heaven .
We really know that .
If you ask a <unk> question , how many of you have a big amount of <unk> -- how much of the <unk> <unk> have the energy that flows around each <unk> , and how it flows through every jar of paper is how big it is .
We have a set of mathematical systems based on the fundamental principles of principles that are able to answer those problems .
The problem is that it 's made of cities .
So first of all , one of the most amazing things we have to recognize is that it 's a huge amount of life , it 's a huge amount of <unk> .
This is just a tiny amount of scale , which is our mammals .
Same thing about the same fabric of all of these animals , and we also include that it can grow into a billion units .
Life is so <unk> that this is one of the reasons .
We talk about this .
From us , you 've got all of the body <unk> of all of us .
This is what grows .
That 's where you grow .
This is a mouse that can be you .
We 're very similar .
You can see your situation as well as possible .
You 're quickly going to get growing up .
This is the same principle of what it 's about to make the principles of the deforestation .
And what this means is the growth of the mouse . It 's the data .
That 's the ratio of weight and age .
You see it stop .
This is very good for life to live in Africa , and it 's also <unk> .
But for us , the economic company and the cities of the city are very bad .
And that 's what we think .
This is the diagram of our economy that we 've seen in the upper left - hand corner of our economy .
And what it shows is a lot of software companies and companies that are building the size of the company , and they 're very much more efficient .
So how do we explain ?
We want to talk about biology .
This is how you see the scale of the thing that 's going to grow into this thing .
What you 're seeing here is the <unk> rate of life , where you need to increase the energy of the lives per day , and your weight is worth <unk> .
It 's a very interesting structure , and it 's really interesting that you ca n't see the photos .
In this funny cartoon , you can see everybody falls on the line .
And despite the most extreme systems in the universe , it shows a very simple phenomenon .
This is an astonishing species that every single <unk> of each cell has a evolution of evolution and history in its own particular ecology .
But even in the evolution of Darwin 's evolution and the natural selection , they finally backed up a line .
There are other forces .
I 've played this curve on the bottom of the day .
It 's about three times smaller than four .
There 's a little bit of a thing here .
When the largest <unk> appeared , when the sun double , it double the amount of energy .
And if you look at the linear - <unk> ratio , it 's essentially about 75 percent of the energy that 's going to increase it .
And the magic of biology is that it 's extremely glamorous to show economic capacity .
In order to define this , the more <unk> of the system is the average amount of skill for the <unk> .
You can think of anything as many consequences as if you 're participating in this kind of thing .
It 's really amazing .
As long as you say , I 'm going to tell you about the size of the world , and I 'll tell you about 90 percent .
That 's why the Internet is .
All of life is driven by the Web , whether it 's a cell or a <unk> , or more cells .
You 're not familiar with these networks .
This is a little critter that grows in the elephant .
This is the end of my talk .
And you have the concepts of the networks of networks that are pervasive , and all the major principles of scale , all sorts of limitations of sunlight , including the deforestation , where you 're in the inside of your body .
And what I did n't talk about is that the rhythm of growing growth will be <unk> as you increase .
It 's going to slow down from you to live longer , through oxygen and stuff .
The problem is that this is also true for the city and the corporate city .
Whether it grows in London , the <unk> <unk> grew up , and so on .
In New York , whether the San Lama grew up , San Francisco grew older .
Not knowing us later later .
But they 're all the most important networks in the world .
Cities is just the same thing that you 've never seen and <unk> to connect to each other .
It 's just a simple chart .
This is the progress of the city .
This map shows that a very simple example of this is that the number of times the size of the <unk> is the equivalent of scale .
It shows the trends .
And you tell me that the size of the city , I can say , how many of you have a big <unk> .
Yves <unk> 's <unk>
This is the scale economy .
The more cities are more than less than the other side of the city .
And here 's the opposite .
What 's going on in the form of growth ?
It reflects that the state of Europe in Europe , but if you look at Japan , the same scale is equivalent to the equivalent of the <unk> .
And all of the structures that you see here are the distances , and the length is the equivalent of growth , which is the same scale as well as the head .
And this is the beginning of the system , and it 's all about planning .
And when you see social economic loss , we started building social economy , and we 're going to make a difference .
<unk> on <unk> , as a matter of scale .
The bottom here is " You 're <unk> <unk> . "
It shows the phenomenon of scale .
And the most important thing about <unk> is <unk> <unk> seals , which is more than one tenth of the distance between one person .
It means that the amount of multi - level <unk> is much more glamorous than the <unk> of the civilization , the more powerful <unk> that we have in the biology , and the higher people who have the same <unk> spray and <unk> .
And we studied all sorts of things about AIDS and so on .
Put it together .
So let 's show you the GDP of the country where we put income GDP and patents .
You can see it .
Next is the chart .
If one city size comes from 10 to 20 percent of the size of a million to tens of thousands of miles from the city , anyone who 's going to spend a lot of money in this city .
It 's all about 15 percent of all things that you 're going to save .
That 's certainly the reason for the city of cities , <unk> million people .
They think that these beautiful things contain a lot of money for people who are <unk> , and they forget the side of the city .
And that 's why .
I do n't have the mathematics to explain to you about what it is , because it 's a <unk> .
And this 15 percent of the principles that this hospital is true , whether you 're in the middle of Japanese Japan , Japan .
Despite the growth of the city , the result is the same result .
And here 's a general rule .
<unk> is we 're cities .
Cities are what we 're doing with each other , with these activities .
I told you earlier .
These are the networks and their mathematical structures that are different than the size of the <unk> civilization , which is the speed of increasing economic growth .
And if the social networks of the city are <unk> , it 's increasing the higher speed of <unk> , which is increasing increasing .
The more you grow faster , the faster you grow faster .
On the left there is the <unk> on the left .
And on the right - hand side , there 's this growth of growth in a lot of Europe in Europe .
And then I want to talk about growth .
And this is the <unk> of biology .
The scale of the brain makes a difference .
You quickly grow up , and you stop growing , that 's what we 're going to do .
It 's not about the economic and the cities .
And one of the most amazing things about this is that if you make the scale and the size of your economy , it 's <unk> , and then you get a nice <unk> .
In fact , if you compare it to the data , it 's very closely the greenhouse of the economy .
And yet there 's a <unk> drive that pushes it into this system , which is really <unk> .
And what it 's about is that many of the reasons why there 's a lot of reasons to get a lot of money in <unk> .
How do we avoid this situation ?
What we do is that when we develop a big , big innovation , we 're going to move from a new way of looking at a goal .
So this is a sustainable cycle of innovation that 's going to depend on demand .
But this <unk> requires you to continue to accelerate innovation .
So the situation is that we 're not sitting in a high - speed machine , and we have to accelerate accelerating the machine .
We have to keep accelerating .
The question is , as social economic , we can avoid heart attacks ?
And I 'll leave you with the <unk> of the company .
The size of the company is increasing .
This is on the right .
Same chart .
This graph shows that income and productivity companies are equivalent to people .
We can also use <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> , it starts with a smaller floating , floating .
We looked at the <unk> in the States .
I 'm just showing you the tip of the iceberg .
It 's an unexpected place where they 're growing up in scale , like the <unk> of the civilization , which suggests that <unk> is not linear , and it does n't mean it 's a <unk> activity and an idea of scale .
In this case , <unk> and Teller can say they 're doing great things .
So if you tell me that the scale of the brain is the size of a car , I can do that .
If you increase the scale of the <unk> , we should get a S - increase ratio .
This is a kiss that looks like a <unk> .
We love that shape <unk> .
But if you look at me , I 'm actually going to show you , because I 've played it in 2012 .
Let 's see how to 2008 .
The red line is predicted by theory .
If I started in 1994 , I would be able to predict the <unk> of the car now .
This is happening in all of the companies .
These are all <unk> companies .
And they started <unk> the shape of the <unk> , and then they released the final end of the end .
Thank you .

<unk> to share with you three surprising things that she learned from teaching from a mistake .
children , culture , education
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : How to learn from mistakes
I worked for a very long time in my work , and I was teaching a lot of knowledge about the knowledge of kids and learning to understand the potential of the students .
In 1931 , my grandmother came from you on the left , from eighth grade .
She was teaching knowledge because of the past , it was the place where knowledge existed .
Knowledge in the book , at the teacher 's brain , she needs a school to get these knowledge , because that 's the way it was learning .
<unk> : This is a school that 's only a classroom in the classroom , and the leopard <unk> , my dad is in this only school .
And the same thing , he had to go to school in school to get knowledge from her teacher , and then <unk> these knowledge into his only moving movement , which was his own brain , because it was the way that the knowledge came from the teacher .
When I was small , we had a new encyclopedia .
From my birth to birth , it 's a fabulous thing , because I do n't need to wait to go to the library .
And that 's really fantastic in my house .
This is a very different approach to the past , and it 's a way to change the way that I interact with information .
But this knowledge is far away from me .
I can stop them .
And in the last few years , since I was reading high school , we were actually looking at the development of the Internet .
When I started with the Internet , as a tool for teaching , I moved to the state of state , where I went to <unk> , and a town called <unk> <unk> -- and I had the opportunity to teach the <unk> of a beautiful <unk> village , which taught me most about the U.S. government .
That 's my first year in my teaching , <unk> , ready to teach the U.S. government .
These are these year - old kids who do n't exist for the U.S. government system .
And the second year I learned was to teach me something , to change my education .
I offer them a real experience that allowed them to learn .
I do n't tell them what they do , or how to do it .
I just came up with a problem in front of them , and they had a elections in their community .
They <unk> the <unk> , the price of Japanese offices .
They <unk> with <unk> .
They came up with a Japanese election award to <unk> the <unk> of the candidates to understand these candidates .
They invited all of the people to go to school and talk to the <unk> of government and politics , and in every street , the students are really doing powerful <unk> learning .
At the end of the school , she looked at me , and she said , " Oh , look at her , much more naive . "
She said , " She does n't know what she is . "
But I know kids will be like , I think , every week I 'm telling them how I expect them .
And this evening , every single night , all of a sudden everybody 's kids , <unk> , completely <unk> <unk> .
I just need to sit down and look at it .
That 's their evening , that 's the experience , it 's a real experience .
That makes sense for them .
And they 're going to make it more difficult .
When I left the <unk> , I moved to beauty , and I taught a couple of books in the town , teaching a few years ago , teaching <unk> students .
Fortunately , I did n't teach American political politics .
I 'm even more excited about this .
Again , very excited about learning .
But what 's interesting about this is that I found a bunch of very very different kinds of people who are very , very diverse , and they have the same amount of kids in a real <unk> .
One of the opportunities is that we have to meet with Paul <unk> , and this gentleman is the movie " <unk> hotels " based on the character of <unk> .
He talked about the high high school speaker .
We can walk into that school , and we do n't even have to sit in a bus .
They do n't need extra spending , very perfect ones .
And then the problem that you 're going to do is how to deal with the way that ethnic <unk> talks about race using this problem , which is a way of responsibility and respect to the question of what they know about what 's going on .
So we decided to look at what 's going to be done by Paul <unk> , which is an example of how to do something a little bit better about what 's going on .
And then I challenge these kids , and they 're going to find out their stories in their own stories , or they 've found that they think they do something like this .
I want them to make a film for those people .
This is our first time to make films .
No one really knows how to use the computer to make films , but they 're very interested in them , and I 'm going to use them to use their voices .
That 's really the best way of inspired by the kids when you want them to talk to their voices , to say the stories they want to share .
And the final question of this surgery is that you 're going to have to use your own life to positive people .
The ones who say that they say they 're going to be very glamorous when you ask them to do it .
That 's where I live in the face .
I was teaching in the science of Science , and it was a mixture of the <unk> and the University of Philadelphia and Singapore .
We 're a nine - year - old high school High School , but we 're very different .
And I was moved there to be a way to work a little bit about the way that I understood how kids could be focused on all of the possibilities of all possibilities , and when you 're willing to give you the past standards , the <unk> of my dad , when I went to my grandmother , to the old age of our <unk> , because it was the message of information that we 're in .
So how do you deal with knowledge around the circle ?
Why do you get kids to school ? What if they do n't need to get a curriculum ?
In Nashville , we have a project of people who have laptops , so these kids carry their laptop every day , with the computer , to learn knowledge .
One thing you need to learn is that when you give a student tool tool to get them to be able to achieve knowledge , you have to adapt to a idea that the child thinks of failures as a part of learning .
We 're going to take a culture of education , and we have a cultural solution to a single <unk> of culture , but I 'm here to tell you , this is n't learning .
It 's absolutely a mistake to ask kids who will never be wrong .
Hopefully they 're going to have the right answer , not allowing them to learn .
So we did this project , and this is one of the paintings .
I almost never showed these , because we have the idea of error and failures .
And my students made this information that we decided to be able to do this with the <unk> of the past - year - old content .
And I asked them to take the information that they saw in the media , and that information is to show you how interesting it is , to look at what 's interesting about the other person 's history .
I 've done some other conditions for this session .
And they think that this session is hard , because we 've never seen it , and they do n't know what to do .
They can talk about this question , very narrow , and they can also write a very very nice way , but when they 're asked to use a different way of thinking .
But I gave them the space to do this .
And to create , to find out how to do it .
Let 's do something we can do .
And the last time you 've never seen the best of the world , it does n't make any <unk> .
This is about 10 percent of the time .
And this is the students who come from a very good deadline .
And then I sat all the students down , and I asked them , " Who 's killing the best works ? "
And they immediately said , " That 's " this " . "
They did n't have the content . They said , " That 's it . "
And I said , " Well , what do you make that work ? "
And they said , " Oh , the design is really good , he 's got a good color and some ... "
And they said , we talked about it together .
I said , " Now go to the content . "
And they say , " Oh , that 's kind of a good thing to do . "
And then we talked about another assignment -- it does n't have good visual design , but there 's a very good message -- we 've spent about a hour to talk about this learning process , because it 's not a perfect thing , or I could n't create it .
And this is the assignment that they 're making for themselves . This session has failed , and it 's going to <unk> thinking later , from failures .
And this year , when we try to try something like this , they 're going to do something better than the last year -- because learning has to have some kind of failures , because failures are teaching meaning .
I 've got a million photos to show you , and I have to watch -- well , that 's the one that I love -- and what 's going to be looking at what we 're trying to do at a time where you 're willing to give the idea of thinking about the way that we 're willing to think about what 's going on in the world , to make the idea that they can do something about how to do it ?
Ask them really interesting questions .
They do n't make people laugh .
I want them to go in different places , to see different things . Go to real experiences , refine it .
This is one of my favorite images , because this is a shot of a Tuesday photo , when I asked the students to vote .
This is 22 , which is his first vote , and he wants to share this poll .
But this is also about learning , because we 're going to get them into the real world .
And the point is that if we continue to take education as a way to go to school , rather than experience the experience of learning , the voice of the students , <unk> and failures , we 're going to talk about school .
And all of us are talking about things that are n't going to happen , and if we continue to look at these values , it 's not possible because we 're not able to use <unk> tests , a <unk> culture that has no way to get us out .
We know how to do better , and now it 's better than now .

What <unk> <unk> studies is that <unk> medicine -- in a kind of radical way of thinking about disease and injury , for a way to send signals to the body .
cancer , design , marketing , health care , medicine , technology

Yves <unk> tells the <unk> of human body
I 'm going to talk to you today about romantic love .
Now , when we go to the doctor , we get a little bit of a word that we do n't want to hear .
Some words are <unk> .
diabetes , cancer , pill , productivity , <unk> , we already know that they can be <unk> a person , but we ca n't understand them .
What I 'm going to describe today is a new way of thinking about this kind of disease , and why is this important ? Why if you do n't have it , maybe our <unk> system will break out ?
I promise you , in 18 minutes , I have to finish this .
And I want to start with this picture because this <unk> tells you how to think about it .
This is a lot of different articles about <unk> people in 2002 .
This year is fundamentally about <unk> medicine .
<unk> is a very simple concept that anyone can understand .
It 's a simple thing to say that the speed of <unk> self - <unk> is accelerating .
And we can see how we 've done this in many ways .
We know that if the <unk> injury , we can take a <unk> tag on .
This is the idea of " science " on the cover of Science .
This is the opposite of <unk> medicine .
This is n't <unk> medicine .
Medicine is talking about the cover of the Business Einstein cover , when they wrote a book about <unk> medicine .
And our idea is , do n't think about trying to improve the risk of using medical muscle or drugs -- I 'm still going to talk about this theme -- we 're not doing that , and we change a way to fix the functionality of the body , to <unk> organs and tissues .
At the end of the day , your body is the same .
There 's a lot of bad ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- good ideas are not completely completely glamorous .
And that 's exactly what we 're talking about .
If you 're in the history of history , Charles <unk> -- and he 's going to be more famous at the airport -- is the first thought to think about this idea , and it 's the one who <unk> with his hand , the Nobel Prize , to start thinking about it : we can not nurture ?
And they published a book in 1967 , and they started thinking about it , how do we nurture the whole organ ?
It 's a progress that we have now .
And I 'm going to share with you a little bit about what 's going on here .
But before I do this , what I 'm going to do is share with you about the fear of the <unk> system and why we need to worry about it .
Many talk discussed yesterday has talked about the quality of living quality and loss of poverty , and from essentially changing the global population .
One of the challenges that we have is that the more we have more .
We have a lot of money , the more money that we 're going to do , and we need to spend a lot of <unk> after the age of aging .
It 's a very simple question , which is the wealth of a country that 's over 65 percent of the population .
And then you 're basically seeing the more rich , more than the average population of GDP .
Why is this important ?
Why is this a particularly serious test ?
If the population of population is 30 years old , the average disease is probably just a little bit of a <unk> , maybe occasionally a little asthma .
If the population of the country is 45 to 55 years old , then a normal citizen might face diabetes , early <unk> , diabetes malaria , heart failure , <unk> . These symptoms are fundamentally more difficult .
<unk> look at the population of the United States .
This is from <unk> .
In <unk> , every retired population raise the population population .
<unk> have no serious disease for the people who are losing medical care for Parkinson 's disease .
In 2010 , every retired population only plays two workforce .
Every <unk> country in the world is so glamorous .
How can we have enough money to serve the health service for patients , when the reality of the <unk> is this ?
This is the relationship between the age of the ages and the health care system .
As you can see , it 's about 45 to eight years old , and the health rate goes suddenly .
And this is really interesting -- if you 're doing the right research research , you can see how many of you have spent on your medical care , and put it on the Y - axis of the X - ray of your health .
And then you get seven years before you die .
And you can actually . So -- -- we 're not going to talk about this problem .
There are some things that are very , very small , and that 's what we really can do to change the way that these diseases are , but let 's experience health .
I think there are four things that I want to propose , and this four lessons between insurance and the law system does n't work .
What these systems are doing is change who is trying to pay .
But they ca n't fundamentally change the cost of health care .
One of those is that you do n't care about health care .
We 're not talking about this . This is really depressing .
You can heal this .
There 's obviously a lot of money to be done .
But maybe even more interested in me , it 's much more important for me to be diagnosed with chronic disease , and the disease is not just treated with disease .
For example , in diabetes .
In today , what can we do with diabetes ?
And we ended up representing this patient , but it 's obviously a symptom of its symptoms , in the next 10 , 20 , 30 years , we 're treating it .
<unk> . <unk> is a good motivator .
But ultimately it 's going to lose the disease , diabetes will cause a disorder that can predict it .
Why do n't we <unk> a little bit of the epidemic in diabetes , or diabetes ?
Maybe it 's going to be expensive , but if it works , we can actually solve a new way of solving problems .
And this video , I think , is good enough to understand what I mean .
This is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And if you can do that , why do n't we ?
And I 'll show you some more important characteristics about the body <unk> .
But what we 're talking about is that it 's allowing us to be able to do every organ system for each organ for its own structures and their tissues .
The reality today is , if we get sick , the message we have is that we can treat your symptoms , but you need to adapt to a new way of life .
And what I 'm going to suggest is that tomorrow -- we can debate about what 's going on tomorrow , but in the future , we will have <unk> healing .
This is a prosthetic , actually , a little bit like a soldier from Iraq .
In Iraq , the soldiers in Iraq have lost their faces .
Imagine if they do n't need to go to the face , but face the <unk> of the body .
This is a very bold idea .
And I 'll show you a little bit about what we 've done for this idea .
But again , it 's going to be possible for every organ system .
How do we do that ?
The way we do it is to start with the conversation .
We need to tell the language of our bodies .
<unk> to rediscover the <unk> of <unk> when we 've been born .
A <unk> animal , if you have three three months of <unk> , had lost a limb , and he was going to die .
So our DNA has this <unk> mechanism .
It 's a natural behavior . But when we 're growing older , we get <unk> .
One child , about six months old , and if they lost their own <unk> , they could expand that bar .
When they 're five years old , they lose that capacity .
So , if you want to talk about the body , we have to tell the language of our body .
These are some technologies that are currently using use .
And I 'm going to show you three technologies that we can talk through in these technologies .
The first is cells therapy .
Obviously , in our natural wound , the cells did most of the <unk> jobs .
So , as soon as you can find the right cells , then they 're going to start to <unk> the job .
Secondly , we can use <unk> materials .
Tell us the importance of our new materials yesterday .
If we can develop <unk> , design materials , or <unk> new materials from nature , may be <unk> by these materials .
And finally , we might be able to use some kind of <unk> control of the body , and give him his opportunity to maintain .
And I 'm going to give you a example of what 's going on in the material .
At the University of <unk> , <unk> <unk> had about 10 years ago .
And this idea is that pigs , if you can get all of the cells in the whole world , when you 're able to get rid of it , it can include all kinds of traits and signals that start to self - repair the functionality of self .
And he proposed a very important problem .
And he asked a question , and if I can take this material , it 's a natural material that comes out of the <unk> of <unk> , normally , where I put it in the other places , if she 's going to make a new <unk> in other groups , in each organization , to try to grow a whole new ear , but it is still <unk> .
And if this story does n't work , I wo n't talk about it .
Next picture I 'm going to show you .
It 's a very compelling picture , but for those of you who are sensitive -- even if you do n't want to acknowledge it , light is faint . This is a good opportunity to look at your feet , and what you 're doing is n't looking at the feet .
And what I 'm going to show you is a <unk> of diabetes .
Anyway , the best way to see this before .
This is the reality of diabetes .
And I think a lot of times , when we hear diabetes , diabetes <unk> , we 're not able to interact with the end of the way that we ca n't manage it , and if you could n't keep it .
I 'm going to show you now . There is no time .
That 's an diabetes <unk> . This is a tragedy .
The only cure is that it 's 47 .
This is an old lady , and she 's got a woman who has diabetes or she decided to die in her body .
So this woman is trying to cure that a year later decided to figure out how to try and invent this new treatment .
This is the wound on the spring of 11 weeks .
And this material contains only natural signals .
And this material <unk> his body to the body , and this libertarian does n't happen before .
And I 'm going to show you a couple of scary images -- and I 'll tell you what to look at when you look at the screen .
This is a horse . It does n't work .
And if the worst thing happened , I would n't show you this picture .
The horse is just extended a <unk> , because it 's because of the temple .
And just after a couple of weeks of treatment -- this is the <unk> of this material , and the whole pile of <unk> , which is a few times -- hundreds of tons of blood pressure , on the front - on - line .
And if you look at this <unk> , it 's really good that it looks good .
This is a dolphin , and its fins is <unk> .
We now have 40 million patients using this new material to heal their wound .
Can we grow a limb ?
Yves <unk> came up with a million million dollars to <unk> , and let him lead a project of eight researchers to explore that problem .
I 'm going to show you a thousand million images of this value .
This is a man - old man who lost his <unk> .
And remember I told you that I was losing the lottery , and they could expand , but it was n't going to happen .
And after the treatment , it looks like this .
This is something that can happen .
This is now in <unk> .
And now there 's this material that has been able to do this .
But do we have the other ones ?
Can we , for example , do n't use materials , but at the same time , in the use of this material , the <unk> of the cell , and <unk> a vessel that is <unk> in a body ?
And here you can see a little bit of heart muscle in a limb .
This is an ongoing research in the Japanese hospital in Tokyo .
He grows in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And then <unk> it , to change its trait , and then he can put it directly directly from the <unk> .
It 's really cool .
And what I 'm going to show you now is based on <unk> healing .
I 'm going to show you now from a patient 's <unk> stem cell .
Again , if you 're more sensitive , do n't look at it .
But this is still <unk> .
This is one of the things that 's been done with the heart surgery , and it 's the same thing , but there 's a difference .
But what 's different here is that , in the heart , we 're going to see stem cells from the patient , when the amount of stem cell cells start to send the stem into patient 's heart .
I stand here because I 'm going to show you a little bit about this technology now .
Now stem cells are caught in the patient 's heart .
If you look at this , you 'll see it in this period .
You 'll see stem cells left .
We need all sorts of new technologies and <unk> , trying to get cells into the right place .
There 's a little bit of data here , just a little bit about data .
This is a random experiment .
And the number of times there are only 20 , and now it 's now a hundred hundred .
It 's easy to say , if you get a <unk> surgery , his symptoms are a little bit harder .
If they get stem cells at the same time , the symptoms are almost completely disappeared .
These are just two years ago .
What 's cool is that if you 're in the early age of disease , then you can avoid disease .
This surgery has seen something like this , but it 's a reduction in <unk> surgery , as long as the body is <unk> around the heart , and then <unk> the <unk> for stem cells .
Now stem cells go .
I do n't have a time to go to it , but it 's basically going to work .
We can make the symptoms smaller than the sum of the patients , almost as much as possible .
This is another example of the number of cells that do n't get into a clinical trial , but I think very quickly it will be done .
This is the study of <unk> University , and she 's collaborated with many scientists around the world .
And they think that the fat of the <unk> surgery , in the United States , we have a lot of <unk> surgeries that collect fat <unk> .
This is actually a good stem source .
The fat <unk> a lot of stem cells .
So you can go to the clinic , and you 're going to get out of the <unk> , and you 're going to get your head out .
And then you get fat of the dog , and in this case , stem cells are covered with cells .
This is in the laboratory .
And I think in the future , we can see the patient 's <unk> stem cells in their own <unk> or fatty cells .
And I talked about <unk> some kind of cool devices to <unk> disease .
I 'll last the last example .
This is a cruel thing .
We have a long - term relationship with <unk> scientists , but also <unk> relationships , and they need to cure a million <unk> from Iraq .
Most of them have a serious stomach .
But if we know what 's going on , we understand that it 's frozen , and we ca n't cure .
All the way to treat all of the <unk> -- essentially the skin <unk> .
We 'll take the first skin from one part of the place , and try to get them out of it .
In this case , we came up with a new kind of new way of being able to <unk> the body of the human body -- in the late ' 90s , <unk> it into a clinical trial -- it was designed by <unk> <unk> .
This creature is <unk> in <unk> .
And the <unk> that you see here will be <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of the cells into the wound .
This <unk> will bear around the environment , and also <unk> other things , so we 're going to give it to the clouds of the seed seed , rather than putting the lawn from one place to another .
This is an ongoing cure .
Well , my 18 minutes later .
Let me end with some good news , and maybe there 's a little bit of bad news .
The good news is that these studies are now running .
That 's a great job .
Obviously , those images will make you feel this .
This is not normal hard , because it needs a lot of different kinds of <unk> .
Almost almost every scientific field associated with chronic scientists , and it 's all about trying to make the human body into reality .
Many governments , many places , are already aware of this new way of being a new disease .
<unk> might be the first one , when they decided to invest in this area for 30 billion , and then add 20 billion .
This is <unk> .
In the average age of the population , Japanese is the world 's most ancient country .
So they need to make this research , or their health system .
So in <unk> they did a lot of <unk> in the area .
And the same thing about the European Union .
China , same thing .
The center of China in China has just done it .
The research costs two billion dollars a year .
In the United States , we 've got a different approach .
-- ooh , if you can make Al Gore in the world .
Our approach is different .
And this is basically the project , basically , to give a sense of leadership .
But without any <unk> investment , it 's good to gather the resources and the conditions that have to be able to use them .
I 'm going to end up with a little bit of the end of my talk , maybe <unk> , which is a very glamorous person .
And I visited him with a couple of other people in the <unk> Institute of the other few months ago , and we try to persuade us to make a little bit of something that we 're going to learn from the next year , which is a few hundred million dollars per year to try and help us do it last year .
In the end of this summer , the <unk> of <unk> is like to say , " We 've got a small amount of love , and you 're so big . "
As a cartoonist , I want to say , no could n't change our ideal , but if we put it together , we can change his <unk> .
Thank you .

I 'm going to tell you that when I invited to the conference , I said to myself , it 's TED .
These are the words that the name sounds like , but it 's very simple that they 're <unk> by <unk> scientists , they can influence the world .
So what I would say is that I 'm going to make a difference to my participation .
So I thought , well , I 've got a very strong British accent , which is probably possible .
But I do n't think I should go there , and I 'm going to talk to you about how I am here , because it 's a <unk> <unk> .
So I think I should go here and show you real sound .
There 's a lot of people in the room who know what I 'm saying , because I come from the New Yorker in New York .
But this theme is created .
I know I did n't have a license , and then you 've got a few inventions that have been present today .
And I think I 'm really interested in finding a new person , or a new person .
And each of us has the characteristics of the <unk> of our own body , and the effects of <unk> and <unk> .
But what about other things ?
How much do we try to try and reconstruct self - self and discovery .
How do we define our identity and how to change ourselves ?
So , for example , one person is going to become anything else at any time .
So in the next panel , I 'm going to show you the role of all sorts of characters that I can use to explore this problem .
And I brought them together .
They 're very excited .
And I 'm going to tell you everybody 's ready for a little TED talk .
So you can actually think of it as a <unk> university .
Okay .
Oh , great .
Good evening .
Thank you very much for me today .
Thank you very much . My name is <unk> .
Oh , my <unk> is so many people .
Hello .
All right , I 'm here because a young woman called <unk> Jones .
She 's a very good young lady , girl .
You know she said she was black ; she 's a <unk> <unk> , if you look at it carefully .
No , no .
And she 's here to be here for her performance , " A woman 's Guide show . "
You know what it means , of course .
<unk> <unk> is what we 're going to do , but it 's all her .
But I do n't mind .
I 'm really happy to be here in this place that I 'm so happy to come here .
It was amazing .
This is not just about scientists , there 's a lot of <unk> , there 's a lot of <unk> , and there are many <unk> .
There 's a lot of <unk> here .
I met <unk> <unk> , and I particularly like her .
She <unk> on the Google <unk> <unk> .
That 's really great .
There are other people who are great people .
They 're very excited about them .
Oh , I 've seen <unk> <unk> .
Oh , Jesus , I love it , and she 's really a great thing to do .
She 's only half of the <unk> .
Do you know that ?
But that 's true , but she 's very gifted .
I felt proud of her when I saw her .
And she was shocked .
Okay , so I 'm going to tell you how lucky I feel .
And here 's what I saw .
And for this world , you have to have a lot of responsibility .
You have to know that when I 'm <unk> , it 's almost impossible to imagine .
And you 've been doing this very short time in this short period of time and development , and you 're all young .
Your parents are so proud of you .
And I also love diversity here .
I found that there was a diversity of cultural <unk> .
And when you stand here , you see all sorts of people .
It 's like a <unk> .
The word " <unk> " is no problem .
I always react to what I do n't know what they 're doing .
What does that say ?
I do n't want to be <unk> .
Well , anyway , I just think you 're working together with young people , and some of you are the architect who are really good at building us .
And I 'm very excited to you .
It 's really scary to say that some of you are doing something terrible .
Really real .
For example , the global problem that you say about the world is <unk> around the world .
And of course , we all know it all .
I do n't know what to do in other ways , so I 'm going to use my own way of doing it .
Whatever .
And what 's crucial is that I 'm very happy to see how you 're going to come up with these bad situations .
So I 'm going to give you all of you <unk> .
Thank you all of you .
It 's <unk> you to become TEDsters .
There are more successful successes .
<unk> you .
Hey .
Thank you so much .
It 's really fantastic to be here .
My name is <unk> <unk> , and I 'm just going to show you what 's going on here .
I 'm a <unk> in <unk> .
In fact , I grew up saying that I was growing up in the <unk> of <unk> , or the New York State <unk> in New York .
I do n't know anybody here , but I know Sylvia <unk> came here yesterday .
I think he 's a Mexican in the West , saying that I have enough enough . Sorry .
I just want to do something about it , because this opportunity is very glamorous to me .
And I 'm not talking about that .
Whenever I feel , I 'm particularly fast .
Anyone who does n't know what I 'm saying is <unk> , and you can imagine .
And usually I 'm going to take my legs off .
But even worse , <unk> openness tells me about 18 minutes .
So I think maybe I should be very nervous .
I 'm going to try to do that , so I need to <unk> .
Okay , I want to say that I really love TED .
And everything I love here is incredible .
I ca n't get rid of that .
Seriously , people do n't believe me from where I 'm coming from .
I love TED .
And I know that this is a <unk> name , and I just want to say it 's a really cool thing about this .
I love .
In fact , I have a relationship with myself .
I 'm now in college now .
And I came up with a couple of friends in school , and I was very leaders , as you 'd like to enjoy this idea .
This organization is called <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of what you 're creating , and what 's called " <unk> " is a <unk> - <unk> group , a professional - American group of American participation and babies .
And I know that the name is a little bit long , but because of the destruction wars , it does n't work for us to do this with <unk> , which allows us to use <unk> .
So the <unk> of this organization , I mean , is charity - funded organizations who are charities for mothers and babies , and we 're trying to do a lot of lessons for school in the middle of school .
I was a mom , but I would go to school .
You know , it 's important to find the model .
I know our life is very different .
Even in work , I just had just won the <unk> .
Now my work is really exciting to me , because I 'm the markings of <unk> leaders , which is my new titles of New York .
But I think you have a company that 's so important for us to do this , so that we can make a very important project to try to refine their minds .
If everybody has a way to get this opportunity , it 's different , you know .
So I think all of us have to have this need , but I 'm particularly concerned about the people who are , I mean , the subject of the Red Cross , we 're going to become a majority of the majority of people in the two weeks .
So we should get a lot of opportunities for other people .
So I 'm so happy that you 've done this in the Internet , and you put it on the Internet .
This is fantastic , I love .
I love your love for TEDsters .
And if you do n't mind , I 'm personally going to explain to the <unk> of the TED <unk> and the <unk> of technology .
Thank you .
All right , that 's the kind of archetype that <unk> <unk> and every single person you 're going to meet today , and all of these friends who are in my real life and their friends are my friends and family and family .
I come from a little culture .
In fact , you 've just seen that little woman who had this little girl in my mother 's son .
<unk> believed me .
But besides my family , my parents were going to send me into the United States , and I had a lot of <unk> , including Alexander , who Alexander my French teachers .
She 's going to know when she 's teaching us about French English .
<unk> Lady . Yeah .
You know , she 's a typical French in the classroom .
She 's very glamorous , but she 's extremely glamorous .
She talked about life in the classroom .
We did n't have about 11 years old .
But ...
It 's a <unk> three - year - old experience , because I 'm the only black man in the classroom , and even though I 've got a U.N. school .
But this happened .
The <unk> of my <unk> teachers never <unk> anyone anybody .
There 's never been always been fair before , all of us who have never seen anything that we 're going to do at the classroom .
All right , so this is my teacher , and my friends and all of the friends from the world who are very , very good at today are , until I 'm very excited today .
They engineered a lot of creativity .
Like my friend 's friends .
I just want to say that evening .
My name is <unk> <unk> . Thank you for me .
TED Fellow has spread global .
I come from India , I want to tell you that <unk> <unk> tells me that we can have a chance to go to the TED conference , and I 'm really happy to talk about the carrot , because you know that I am a vegetarian .
My job is usually to go to Washington <unk> .
And I have to have all sorts of meetings to talk to those people who are willing to make me feel comfortable for me and say , " How often do they eat a lot of wine ?
So you can imagine that .
But I 'm happy to participate in your activities .
I hope that you have more time to go with you , but you can just stop .
Unfortunately , there 's no lot of time to let all of my friends meet you , but I have the first time in <unk> , and I 'm here for you .
But I really want you to show you the other couple of friends you should recognize , if you saw " <unk> " .
Thank you .
Good evening .
My name is <unk> , and I 'm going to tell you that I am in New York .
But when <unk> Jones brings me to the TED conference , first I said , I 'm not going to talk to you about the number of people in the two years , and I wo n't talk about it , because I do n't want a word of talking about a bad person , but I think it 's not a good talk .
But I 'm going to try and do something like <unk> <unk> .
So my daughter is helping me tell me that she 's going to start a joke with a joke .
I want to tell you about my background .
My husband and I took us from the 1980 's and our daughters , and there was no freedom in China that China did n't have that freedom .
We 're trying to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition , but it 's very hard .
You know , I 'm going to talk to kids as an immigrant , but they 're always writing English .
They like the rock culture and the American culture .
But when they get older , we want them to return back to the old culture .
But the problem is that .
My son said he did n't get married .
He 's got a girlfriend , but she 's not Chinese .
I 'm not saying that this is bad , but I said to him , " What 's wrong with China ? "
I think he 's going to change the idea .
And I decided to focus on my daughter .
The daughter of her daughter is special .
But she said she was n't interested in her .
She just wants to talk about her friends .
When she went to college , she basically went home .
She did n't want me to go to school .
And I think that 's the question .
I <unk> my wife , and I had a single person .
But she told me that Mom you do n't need to worry about her son because I do n't like them .
I mean , men are a problem , but all women are used to be used .
She said , " No mother , I mean I do n't like girls . "
I 'm a <unk> .
I 've always been teaching my kids to respect the American people , but I said to my daughter , it 's an exception , she 's not <unk> ; she just <unk> <unk> .
But she told me that she was n't American .
She said she loved a Chinese girl .
These are what I want to hear from my son , but it 's not my daughter .
And I do n't know what to do .
But for a while , I started to understand that she really was a person .
Even when it 's too hard to get to what I want to share with you , I 'm going to tell you what this society is , because there 's a lot of people who are like TED , like this kind of idea that you do n't like .
And I think that the TED conference has a huge impact on our lives .
So I 'm going to represent my daughter , thank you for sharing .
Thank you .
Good night is <unk> <unk> .
I want to thank you for <unk> Jones because I 'm the only one who 's going to get a lot of pressure , and I am the last talk .
I came from <unk> .
I teach <unk> in my <unk> .
Not Harvard .
I feel ashamed .
But I was proud of my student .
And I saw them come out of the conference .
I 'm going to give you <unk> .
Even though I know that I do n't look like a <unk> , I 'm not saying that we live in the Earth , and we 're not going to see the difference between our <unk> .
And if you want to share a poem for you , I 'm going to show you one poem when you 're 16 .
So let 's go back to the old age .
This is a poem that <unk> me to my hands .
And I think that 's your hand .
And I think that 's your hand .
And when I do n't feel happy , I 'm happy .
And I ca n't believe that I could n't feel that emotion , and I ca n't stop it .
Okay , notice .
Maybe a little bit of a <unk> , because I was listening to the song in my life .
They 're very popular in the radio .
So what I want to say is that I believe that even though there are some words that allow us to connect with each other , but it has always been a lot of characters that are <unk> in the neighborhood , and the <unk> are rising across the continents .
I <unk> that we 're going to do it in this way .
That 's how thank you so much for me .
Okay , good .
Thank you very much for admission .
Thank you so much .
Thank you so much .
And you have to say that .
And I said , thank you very much .
I want to thank you so much for Chris and <unk> , every single one of you here .
I spent a long time to come here and feel like this .
I know that some of the companies I 've ever seen before you 've seen my performance , but today you have the best audience in the world that I have .
And everything is so glamorous that you 're not going to get to rediscover self - discovery .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> is focused on the health care industry , and his <unk> training in the hospital in Canada , <unk> , the <unk> of the Japanese hospital , is the challenge of what 's going on .
Africa , activism , design , marketing , health care , invention , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : The hospital in Nigeria
And to understand what 's going on in the world , it 's a lot of things that we 're going to do .
In 1975 , I was in <unk> .
And as my parents were traveling , we returned to our own <unk> .
In 1986 , I took a degree of medicine .
When I was doing my mother , I could barely control my mom with the <unk> of 13 years , and I 'm a surgeon .
And this explains why many of our professions now are <unk> in different places .
So , do we need to be able to change this fact that we 're only trained to get trained , and then do n't go back to it ?
Maybe not , I do n't want to say that because of the difference that I expected .
It 's a Africa map in Nigeria , and this is a map of Africa , which is known as well .
People are being kidnapped , and they 're the source of oil , but sometimes I feel like I 've had a lot of fun in Nigeria .
But , " <unk> poverty , this slide comes from a discussion that I 've done . <unk> talks about why Africa and the world is in health .
Very interesting .
Do you remember a couple of people in the mold ?
Believe it , in Nigeria , it 's a state .
Nigeria used to be in the past -- 1994 , that 's a two - year , a police sit down .
So , tell me , you have a couple police ? What ? Three , three .
Believe me , in Canada , it 's not just police , we sit down , and I 'm sitting there , I have no helmet .
And the photo makes me think about what 's going on in this car , if someone 's lying in the car .
Whether you do n't believe , some people are <unk> .
Some people did get malaria ; we won the threat of AIDS .
And I tell my family , my wife , every time I remind me , you know , when you go to that country , your life is <unk> .
She <unk> . Every time you go to there , you 'll understand that , if you really need a care care , it 's all a <unk> , and so there 's a lot of accidents , where there are all sorts of players who are engaged .
And when they need to help , what do you need ?
It 's not just about the irony , but AIDS , HIV , malaria , <unk> -- so many .
I want to say , when they 're in my place , what will they do ?
When I go home -- and I 'm going to do all sorts of things . I want to teach , but if I have to get one of the diseases , or if you have a disease , where do they go to ?
What do they do when they die or disability ?
And I feel very impressive . That 's where they go .
These are not ancient images , these people are n't glamorous . This is a big hospital . In fact , it 's a major hospital in Nigeria .
This is not a year in the operating room .
This is <unk> equipment in Nigeria .
Remember what I said about oil ?
I 'm sorry that if that makes you feel comfortable , I think you have to look at this , that 's the floor .
You can say this is a problem .
It 's a question of health , and I 'm not talking about <unk> .
I want to say that we need a vaccine that 's not just obesity , malaria , AIDS , because I hope they 're going to get treated in a normal hospital , if I do n't have a cure .
In fact , when I started traveling around , " Hey , young people , you 're in the U.S. expert , and can you go home with me ? "
I want them to think , " still there is hope . "
Next , look at this , this is <unk> .
This is my job , right ?
<unk> and <unk> care -- look at the glasses .
It 's used by <unk> , which is <unk> in Britain .
Believe me , this is actually the picture .
And if that happens , it happens in the U.K. , which is where they go . That 's my job for focus .
This is one of the slides I 'm talking about in Nigeria . We call it " <unk> <unk> . "
Because the stakes are very scary , but we need to .
So this is the problem .
Tell us what it is , right ?
I think we all know that , but some of the speakers are still telling us more questions .
These are some of them . What do I do ?
And here , we 're doing <unk> .
We 're ready to go to the heart surgery , and I 'm the only <unk> England , other people who are Americans , including <unk> doctors , <unk> nurse , special nurse .
We all walked out of the way , and we 've got three times .
And I want you to know , I 'm sure to believe that it 's help to help me believe charity . They have a role . But what if they 've ever talked about what we 're talking about ?
Because not everybody could enjoy <unk> .
health care is wealth , and Hans Rosling says it 's a word .
And the first thing is that health can get better .
So , we 're doing <unk> , but there 's a big deal .
Nigeria surgery in Nigeria -- difficult .
That 's Michael , <unk> just ended up in <unk> .
Did he look happy ?
And it took us two days , and I thought , well , what do we do , but he looks happy ?
Yeah , this is the <unk> advice of the Times , which is , " Yes , I 've told you , you do n't have to , you know , I am sure . "
And look , that 's our <unk> . So , what do you do ?
And I persuaded him to tell me about it . <unk> technology , with me .
Let 's do it together .
Look , that 's usually what we found in Nigeria and in Africa .
We 've got a lot of license .
<unk> device , no good equipment , or if you ca n't fix it , it does n't work , so we can move it .
But we have a problem , we 've got serious problems .
And he had to be a telephone , and he was always talking about the telephone .
So what do we do now ?
It looks like all of the American people , and there 's a British , who 's not going to do anything , he thinks he 's the U.K. , which is a female , I think .
We 're going to make this machine work , and that 's certainly , but it 's just one , even more old than you can see .
And the reason for that photo , this X - ray <unk> , is to tell you where we are , and how how to observe the X .
You see where it is , right ?
Do n't you have no X - rays ?
Everything is going to be used for all of you .
And you 're looking at the X - ray of the screen , and then you get diagnosed with email and send it to email , but we still do n't even have X <unk> .
We 're working on our chest surgery .
I know that not AIDS , not malaria , but we still need this one , and we 're still trying to get kids ready , big people .
There are people who are taught to teach -- heart disease , heart attacks , valves in the foreground , the hole in the heart , <unk> .
There 's a lot of people who believe that science is coming .
The oxygen <unk> is <unk> , normal , normal .
She 's the <unk> surgery that she asked , when she was a child , she had to cure .
We have to do it for adults . We did it , so we did .
We 've done three times , and we 're going to do this in the north of the country for seven months , so we certainly do n't have a surgery , but you can see the <unk> and all sorts of things that we need to transport , because it 's not the people who make the equipment that are n't doing this .
<unk> is bad .
But we did a few surgeries for the first time ? 12 .
We did 12 ft - surgery .
This is our first patient , just from <unk> , and look at this chair , OK .
And that 's exactly what I 'm talking about .
That 's he 's doing it right now , because it ca n't be done .
Have you ever seen this before ?
No ? Anybody ? Well , it works .
I 'm sure you 've already seen or heard or hear , and we do n't have to do this with this kind of <unk> conditions and insist on a lot of the conditions that we 're doing .
Thank you . This is my <unk> company -- <unk> .
The only purpose for it is to offer anything that needs to be .
So we put on your hand , and we say , " Hey , we 've bought something . "
We create a company to teach knowledge , educate people , to move them forward .
That 's a perfect example .
And usually when you get out of the hospital , you buy a different car for kids , buying a difference . This can do anything . It does n't need a lot of money .
If you do n't know this in the U.S. , we know , because it 's our commitment to what we 're looking for for Africans -- that 's the right price to work , so we continue to study .
This little piece of this is that you 're 12 yards old in your car , like the <unk> , the mobile phone of the cell phone ?
And that 's how you design .
Yes , it 's going to take solar panels .
But if you have power , it 's here to drive batteries .
What do you do ? We 've designed claws , and we 've got it .
And if they ca n't use it , if you can find a car , battery and power put it , you can do it .
What do you want to do with a surgery , or a regular surgery ?
And you know , the device is <unk> .
Now we 're working on oxygen . <unk> heat .
The oxygen supply technology is not new technologies .
<unk> is a very old technology , and the new thing is , I hope that a couple of months later that you can use the ability to use energy systems to make oxygen to create oxygen . <unk> -- that 's not really new -- it 's <unk> air .
<unk> <unk> , what 's the oxygen ? Lots of oxygen .
So this is n't really new , we 're going to do it with this technology .
These are the basic qualities of my devices .
That 's the particular place .
In addition to this winning prize , it 's also <unk> , and it has been registered , they 've got <unk> and <unk> that someone does n't know , that 's in Europe .
If you look at the goods in the market , prices are cheaper , bigger , larger , higher , higher .
This photo was taken last year .
These are my cousins in 1986 .
This gentleman is in <unk> Mark , the gentleman 's home , you know , might know .
We have a lot of <unk> , <unk> Hans -- Hans Rosling , who is the people who are <unk> -- and if you have the best attention , it 's the problem , but we really need a solution to Africa , and the solution is to look at the money in Africa to see people and see their culture .
<unk> people , because they 've got passion .
There are many people there .
You have to do that . Africa has to be done . People are connected .
Thank you .

Jeff <unk> on the world 's web
And I 've always come up with me on the phone , and I 'm going to call you the TED House . That 's a couple years .
In 2000 I 'm ready to tell you about eBay , but it does n't have a telephone .
In 2003 , I was ready to make a talk about " <unk> Foundation and " Social entrepreneurship . "
In 2004 , I founded a company called " <unk> , " and we did n't have the telephone .
From the last year I got a telephone , and I ended up on <unk> <unk> .
And TED is upset .
When I first came into Hollywood , I found that there was a lot of good news in Hollywood .
There 's also a good company in the media .
And I found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley are more connected than I suppose .
Hollywood has its sexy attraction , Silicon Valley have its glamorous symbols .
Hollywood has its own <unk> , Silicon Valley .
Hollywood has its own " <unk> " for " Silicon Valley . "
So there 's a lot of things that are much more common than I suppose .
But I 'm going to tell you a story here .
And part of me is about my personal story , and when Chris invited me , he says that I 'm a little bit <unk> about what I want to know .
My real motivation is -- a way to think about the future for all of us .
A peaceful <unk> and <unk> world .
We heard about a lot of people in the last few days of the past days and James <unk> 's photos , and you 've seen that the next distance , I call it " Human 2.0 <unk> . "
This is the hope of all of us , in our heart , to <unk> the most powerful mistakes in the world .
One is the word " opportunity , " and that 's what the Clinton administration said next night : " No <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . "
But the bigger gap , perhaps , is the " hope of hope . "
You do n't know where the bad ideas are , they 're not going to make any impact on the world .
It 's frightening .
So <unk> comes from today , since we start , we have the ability to <unk> " opportunity and " hope .
If you do n't change the world , you can not change that world .
So for me , it 's all beginning to come up with a lot of family takers , and often in New York .
The summer there is really <unk> , except my sister , or <unk> , or <unk> .
I read writers in James <unk> 's James James de <unk> .
In their stories , the world is a highly <unk> place .
And I think that if I could write something about this world , maybe the <unk> of the world might <unk> the action of what we 're interested in .
I know that 's not the best possible solution , so I decided to start looking at the path of <unk> to write these stories .
By 14 years old , I had a lot of impact on me .
My dad came back to me and told me that he had cancer , the situation was bad .
He said that he was afraid of death , but he did n't have the same thing he wanted to do .
John <unk> , for many years , is still alive .
But for a young young man , it 's a <unk> experience that someone can never know .
So I have a very strong emotional urgency , which is <unk> .
I founded <unk> companies , and I think that would give me the freedom to bring .
One of the companies that had done is the computer <unk> , which is mobile , is called a <unk> calculator , and this is a very glamorous name .
I think what I have to do is how I 'm going to go to my Stanford business business .
And I came up with a friend called <unk> <unk> , and he 's brought down today . This is a long picture of a very long photo .
And when I was just finished , my grandfather had a thought that could help people buy things online .
And the wisdom of my college is , I said , " <unk> , this is a stupid idea . "
I 'm right .
But after that , shortly in 1996 , <unk> and I quit our time to build eBay , and the story , all of you know .
The company , two years later , is one of the most famous industries in the world today .
Hundreds of thousands of countries are using it .
But for me , this is a real change .
I 've got a house from <unk> and five men in my house , and they have the <unk> of their <unk> -- and then suddenly I have all the resources .
So what you 're going to do is try to share the amount of money that makes these money available to the world .
And then I learned John <unk> , who was a great man .
He was a architect of " <unk> social , " in the ' 80s .
I asked him , what the best thing I could do is , or anyone can do something about the world to change the problems of humanity in the world .
John said , " Go good . "
Help good work . "
And he made a strong <unk> of <unk> .
And then I came up with a foundation to help the good people doing things .
These are entrepreneurial leaders that are using their businesses and all sorts of powerful ways to solve social skills .
Now we 're called social entrepreneurship .
For a few examples , like <unk> <unk> , for example , the <unk> bank of the world is getting rid of poverty .
There 's a lot of people who are going to do it .
For example , <unk> <unk> developed women in Africa , because she thinks that Africa is extraordinary .
She came up with this organization about 10 years ago , and she had to provide education for more than 25 million African women .
And also , like <unk> <unk> developed the world 's first <unk> company , the first one he built to heal the organ is called " <unk> <unk> , " and it 's called " <unk> . "
She wanted to be completely immersed in the state of the developing world in 2010 .
These are some of the things that help be good .
These things are made of change , and they have a huge influence .
And this is " support , " and <unk> , celebrate . "
<unk> , you know , when you find somebody who 's doing something , help them , to help nurture their organization , or in business , to give them money .
By the meeting of the conference and they 've seen it , it 's like a TEDster , or " social entrepreneur , " which is one of my projects in Oxford .
<unk> their success , to tell the story of their story , not only to celebrate what they do , but their achievements can help <unk> <unk> .
This is the last part of the project , " It <unk> me to think about what I mean when I was a kid , and I would like to hear it for you .
And I think the first layer is writing , and I do n't need a lot of money , and I 'll just get a ticket .
The next light is better than writing . For example , film and TV can affect people .
And I can think of the film that I 'm responsible for , like " <unk> and <unk> <unk> . "
I started thinking about who 's doing this now .
In fact , none of the companies are focused on <unk> .
So in 2003 , I started building a focus on a public social company and have a lot of money , and so many of you have gotten a lot of money .
One of the time " <unk> " is to encourage me to be a lot of times : " The streets of Hollywood are the ones that you think you 're thinking about . "
Of course , there 's other words .
" To become a solution to a <unk> , is the way to make a wedding business for a <unk> . "
Even in 2004 , in January , I was building a company that would be a global media company and focus on <unk> .
Our mission is to <unk> films , to replace and promote <unk> .
We do n't want people to see our film .
We 're trying to engage these social problems .
We launched the first film in 2005 , " The <unk> ' <unk> " " [ " <unk> of The Year " and " Ooh , " " <unk> " and " <unk> . "
And so my surprising surprise was to look at the public .
And we finally ended up with 11 <unk> of <unk> .
It was really important for us for a year .
But even more importantly , people who have come up with our agenda and the active activities , these activities are all around us .
And then we formed the website , and our network community is <unk> .
Our social area of society , for example , is <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- once people look at the movies , and when people look at the movies , they know they can do something .
This is a movie called " <unk> <unk> , " which is <unk> disaster .
But this is by Charlie <unk> 's film , including the power of Women 's rights , power and power .
And at the same time , we 've launched the film , and Congress is talking about <unk> , and we 're trying to avoid the law .
And as you walk across the film , it 's been talked about the audience , and through our social realm , the <unk> of the world , " <unk> <unk> " and " World of Warcraft " is affected by the effects of creativity .
This is a very <unk> thing for me , because it 's a film that tells the truth about real life , to <unk> her boss , the <unk> of her <unk> , <unk> the law of <unk> <unk> .
And the story of this film is to tell the <unk> of these great laws .
But again , let 's go back to help .
I 'm going to talk about TED , and I want to show you a little bit about Al Gore in 2005 , in November , the theme of the world .
At that time , I wanted to understand something about global warming .
That 's just 30 -- 50 years or 50 .
But look at his talk , I knew what happened .
At the time , I went to <unk> <unk> and found that there was a winner of the <unk> , <unk> David , with Davis , and Davis <unk> .
At the bottom of the Al Gore , we decided to <unk> his talk , and we think that it would take a lot of information for 100 or 200 audiences in the world .
As you know , there 's a quote in Hollywood , " How many things will happen . "
I think that 's really the best campaign for charity .
It also makes us very excited when the film really gets really interested in the public , and it 's the <unk> of the U.K. , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
We have 50,000 high teachers in the U.S.
It changed the discussion of global warming .
This year is very profound for Al Gore .
Al Gore 's now is called the Global <unk> .
But for the sake of the community , this is just a beginning .
We look at the big problems in the world .
Now there 's a couple of movies that are shooting at the process , and there 's a lot of <unk> in the process .
I want to quickly introduce a few movies to come out of the film .
One is the war of <unk> Wilson , " <unk> Lady " by <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
I talked about how <unk> Wilson is going to teach the real story of the Taliban in Afghanistan .
Another movie is called <unk> , and it 's based on novel people , " <unk> <unk> . "
And we think that when people look at these movies , they 're more important to the world , right ?
The " Chicago " will first be first in <unk> .
It tells you that the <unk> of democracy in 1968 , <unk> <unk> , and his story reveals this story , which is a lot of impact on a group of individual effects .
Another film about Jimmy Carter talked about a few years of effort for the Middle East of the Middle East .
In particular , we 've been following him recently , and you all know that this book is n't a controversial statement , which is not a good <unk> .
And finally , I want to say , everybody has the opportunity to make a difference .
Every single person in this room can be done by success , or anything else .
One of my experience is through many ways .
Whether you 're an <unk> or a non - profit , or people who are <unk> , you can do something that we can do with it .
I think , if we take effort , we can change the opportunity and hope .
I could also imagine , if we did 10 years later , it was like , " There 's a new amount of AIDS in Africa : " [ <unk> ] [ " ' <unk> <unk> " ] " " Jurassic <unk> ' ] ' " And [ ' ' Elephant Year "
My favorite <unk> is <unk> .
And finally , one of the slides lists on eBay is now obsolete , and now we 're going to put it in museum museum .
And I believe that all the effort goes together .
Thank you for listening to me today .
I feel really honored .
Oh , thank you .

In the age of eight years of <unk> <unk> , she did n't have the movement of her work , and she was going to move out of the <unk> of AIDS , who wanted to raise the people who had HIV / AIDS for AIDS and to fight AIDS . She shares the story of a woman who worked with Nelson Mandela .
AIDS , Africa , activism , health , personal growth

Annie <unk> <unk> : Why I 'm going to become an AIDS vegetarian
I 'm going to share a story with you , and it tells you how to become an AIDS <unk> .
And that 's where I started motion , <unk> sport .
In November , 2003 , I went to the <unk> <unk> Foundation , and this is also a HIV foundation .
<unk> is the <unk> of Nelson Mandela .
And on stage stage , with me , we 're enjoying the most extraordinary moment of life in life .
And so the next day , all of the news came to the museum , and he came up with a lot of news reports , with Nelson Mandela , who was standing in his window .
And you can also see <unk> ice cream .
Well , it 's a real moment for us .
At the time , Mandela was invited to the National Museum of World War II in South Africa , and there was a hundred percent of the women who had died every day , so that the people who were going to die per day in the day .
And this is a huge amount of impact , because I 'm also a mom , and I have no idea that the AIDS epidemic has spread into this , which can be influenced by women .
When I left the <unk> , I put my choice in South Africa , and I said , " I 'm going to walk on . "
It 's service . "
And then I went to the Grand Canyon of <unk> , and I came up with all sorts of meetings and interviews with various meetings , so I 'm going to use the promise of a singer and a promise to Nelson Mandela , because I was responsible for him .
The world is not respectful of anesthesia . Everyone 's <unk> Mandela .
But they know about the <unk> of the South African South Africa , the viral epidemic in Africa is the largest epidemic in the world .
If I get out of this <unk> , I would say that South Africa would tell you what South Africa would say .
A few years later , I was very fortunate to meet <unk> <unk> , who was the founder of the <unk> Movement , and he was a great <unk> and human rights <unk> .
I met him with a <unk> party .
And he 's wearing a lot of <unk> with me .
It 's a tool . This tool tells you what you 're doing with AIDS .
Since HIV / AIDS , we can say , " We certainly can talk about this topic .
It does n't matter anything . "
I was a member of a colleague of <unk> <unk> , and I felt proud to become a <unk> organization .
This is a <unk> campaign , <unk> <unk> , which is mostly HIV / AIDS .
But they 're still struggling .
They have a lot of contact with those who have a lot of money .
They have education programs .
They think they should n't become a social social label .
They 're really brilliant .
At the same time , my <unk> movement is also supported by <unk> , and we 're trying to use AIDS to help them .
Most of the things we 're driving most of us are willing to get to the <unk> movement , to support their amazing achievement , and they 're ready for this campaign .
This is my <unk> sport .
<unk> sport is only four to four people , and they 're all about to help me .
Two years ago , I went around the world , and I went to 18 countries .
And this is in Norway , and I have to get a generous remix , which is <unk> on the board of <unk> .
This is in <unk> , and I have the opportunity to wrestle in South Africa , the white <unk> of the South African South Side , where they 're going to do it , because I 've given a short video clip . And that 's the short opening of a video , but they do n't know what 's going on at the top of Africa . They 're not aware of what it 's doing .
<unk> <unk> also came to this concert , and he was the South African <unk> minister , so I did n't want to make a difference with him , which is what we need to do .
This is in <unk> .
In this meeting , I became <unk> and HIV - <unk> .
I was participating in my experience to improve their <unk> .
This is the <unk> of the African Children who I love in <unk> .
And one of the members of those members was to be HIV - infected .
This is in New York , I sat with <unk> <unk> , and he 's the U.N. <unk> .
And I was invited to be a <unk> for a few months ago , and I became a U.N. <unk> <unk> .
And by those ways , I 've got my influence , and I 've got the <unk> of people .
And the news for AIDS to <unk> the world is that they want to see the <unk> between the age of the women and the <unk> of the world that they want to see over the age of their lives .
Very impressive target , but we believe in government , we can achieve purpose .
This can happen .
This is a picture of me and an AIDS mother , and she 's pregnant , but we 're <unk> , because we are sure she can get care of her life and her kids will be picked up .
And her kids are going to get AIDS from AIDS to spread <unk> , and this means that kids have n't got HIV .
It gets all sorts of <unk> from life .
This is the way that government intervention in this HIV epidemic .
And I 'm going to end with the other story that the story is <unk> .
This is <unk> . She 's interacting with me .
And I 'm going to tell you about her story , because she 's a woman who 's <unk> HIV .
<unk> - <unk> Mother is <unk> , and she 's HIV / AIDS .
<unk> had HIV . She had a lifetime .
That 's her seven - year - old photo , she did n't have a big baby .
This is the point of her life , she 's being tortured by HIV / AIDS .
And we 're in a hospital in <unk> , and we spent a afternoon in the afternoon and she 's a cute girl .
<unk> and doctors are great .
They came up with a special nutritional <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
When we leave the hospital , we ca n't predict how she 's going to make a film , even if we shot her .
Obviously , this conference is affecting us a little bit more powerful than this , which is the opposite of the project .
After five months later , we went back to South Africa to see <unk> <unk> .
And the hair on my arm , I do n't know you see it .
But the hair <unk> , because they know I have to give you a <unk> .
That 's what she 's doing .
Is n't that amazing ?
These are the ones that come up with the doctors and the doctors .
And I think you 're quite proud of it .
So I want to say to you , every single audience here , if you want all of the world to get a good nutritional supply of resources , <unk> care and care , and you assume that the Western goal , particularly , is , in particular , what you 're going to tell you is that all countries are able to do it .
All right , I think everyone here is supporting this <unk> .
Thank you very much .

This is a very powerful talk , <unk> <unk> describes the <unk> of Virtual Internet , who says , " How do we use the Internet as the core of the world as core design , rather than control the key , not to control their government as a core <unk> . She believes that when citizens want to protect their citizens , they 're going to get a " Better <unk> era . "
culture , politics , social media
<unk>
<unk> : Let 's get the Internet .
I came up with a piece of ads as well as David <unk> .
<unk> : We are a person who has the same consciousness , same decision .
Our enemy will be <unk> , we 're going to use their chaos .
We 're <unk> .
<unk> : In January of the year , Apple 's going to <unk> the computer .
You 'll see why it 's not like George <unk> describes it as George .
<unk> : The potential message in this video is still very strong .
The technology of innovation creates us all of us .
Fast forward to the next 20 years , and now the Apple <unk> in China , in the Chinese <unk> , on the <unk> of China .
Now , Mark <unk> 2.0 of the American Science Foundation is in the United States , because there 's anyone who thinks that the apple is probably going to <unk> some group .
His use of his use was until he got a <unk> award .
The German <unk> , a news magazine , <unk> used to be <unk> because apple Sagan thinks it 's a little bit too <unk> for the users , so that this magazine can be marketed in the whole Germany .
What 's more controversial recently is the apple makers of the <unk> , because it 's possible to claim that this technique is going to be used for <unk> violence .
This is what happened .
The situation is that private firms are used to use equations that are very , very precise than the power of democracy , which is <unk> for democracy .
Or they do n't think about the authority of authority , and they 're not thinking about it .
Or they 've never seen a lot of money from the government of no sane government , or most of the other things that we 're talking about with what we talk about .
That 's the case .
At the beginning of the Internet , it 's beyond our freedom of freedom , or a lack of physical liberties , almost entirely national control .
But now we have a personal observatory in the virtual Web world .
They call them <unk> and engineering , design , service methods to become some kind of laws in our digital lives , where we do what we can do .
And they <unk> the globalization of globalization in some way , and it 's a very exciting way to do it , but sometimes they 're doing something about what they do , when they control them with these information , which is more powerful than the <unk> of the world .
After all , even freely in the world , if you want to go through the next year , the support of Facebook is from Facebook .
These platforms are very helpful in the last spring and over the course of <unk> and Europe , of course , to help .
<unk> , day day , is Google Google , and the evening is the secrets of Facebook , the Facebook Facebook Organization , he says , " If you want to hire a social , it 's the Internet . "
But the government is dealing with a very stable state of democracy , which is more complex .
And the photo on the left is an Egyptian - <unk> shot , and he 's involved in <unk> countries .
There 's a lot of <unk> as much as many people as long as the Grand Canyon , and then they stack them up there .
But some documents came out of the <unk> , and some of them found their records in their email , their prayers , they were <unk> the content .
A <unk> found a <unk> from the West to the <unk> of Egypt .
And the Egyptian bears think that these tools are still driven by <unk> authorities in the Web .
In <unk> , this year <unk> <unk> -- not like Adam Johnson 's times .
But at the same time you 're trying to deliver the Facebook page and some other <unk> police , they 're all going to be <unk> .
And it 's been called <unk> , the blog writer , who used to be a <unk> member of <unk> when he was elected by the <unk> of the Revolution .
But there 's a lot of controversy about how to deal with this problem .
In fact , in Twitter , there 's a lot of support people who say , " Well , we really want democracy and freedom , but some of it is violent , because it 's very violent and maybe it can <unk> us . "
But the question is , how do you decide who have the power to make sure that they 're not going to get their rights ?
<unk> is a digital <unk> digital singer , which says , " It 's a very simple thing : Good , bad shit in the other side .
Today , things are <unk> . "
Welcome to democracy , <unk> and Egyptian friends .
And the truth is , even in the world of democracy , how to balance the safety of the digital network , the <unk> and the other side of it , we do n't have good solutions .
In fact , in the United States , whether you look at <unk> <unk> 's Julian <unk> , even though he does n't care about the U.S. government and some corporations , they 're doing <unk> methods .
At the end of the United States <unk> <unk> , the British House Foundation stops the <unk> service , despite the fact that <unk> did n't have been <unk> or even worse .
And so we think the Internet is trying to break the <unk> .
This is a map of the world social network , of course Facebook has taken a lot of -- this is good , and it 's a good and bad way to think about Facebook .
But in some parts of the world , there 's still a <unk> .
In Brazil and Japan , it 's because of a unique cultural and language .
But if you look at China and Vietnam and some of the Soviet Union , there 's what 's happening there .
There 's a relationship between a situation where governments and social social networks are forming this kind of stuff , because it 's an effort for the company and the government , and that 's the potential of these platforms .
Now , in China , it 's known to know that the great epidemic of landmines , <unk> <unk> is Facebook and now many other industries .
Some of them are helped by the West .
But this is just part of the story .
The other half of the story is <unk> <unk> , all using China , a system called " <unk> " system .
<unk> , that means censorship and looking at their users .
This is a <unk> that I 've done in 2009 , in the <unk> of China , because it 's a lot of <unk> for the last 20 years -- for example , the content in Florida .
<unk> , the CEO of <unk> -- China is the classic engine of China .
In Russia , it 's not <unk> the Internet , but the encyclopedia of the Web .
This is a website called <unk> , which is an <unk> website .
And in this year , there 's a <unk> that 's been done by a guy called <unk> <unk> , who has been asked by the people who call the " <unk> of <unk> " -- and they 've taken the safety of the <unk> in a little bit of a way that they 're going to get rid of it .
This is <unk> effects , affected by people using Internet tools .
So today , there 's this situation in the world , more and more citizens , the relationship between the Internet , and by the way , it 's based on the Web , and it 's based on personal service and productivity .
So I think the importance of the problem is not to argue whether the Internet is doing good , not bad .
And of course , this is going to make the best people in the world to understand anything about the Internet .
And the most important question we need to ask today is how to develop the Internet .
Because I want you to wonder the only purpose of governments is to service the service of service , and I 'm going to say technology 's only to improve our lives , rather than control or <unk> us .
So the problem is that we know how to protect government .
We do n't always have to do it well , but we have a feeling of what politics and institutions do .
How do you prevent the <unk> of equations , when most ancient people think their main goal is fundraising ?
And usually authorities can not help be a lot of life .
There is a situation , like , in France , the CEO of the Internet said , " We are only the only legal copy of <unk> stands . "
But then he went back to the basics of <unk> <unk> , and it 's going to stop the creator to help sharing the <unk> of citizen assistance , which is that the law has been <unk> by the state of the United States , so that it <unk> the power of a <unk> in the world , but the civil social community has to do a lot of interest at the negotiating industry , whether some political communities are more interested in non - violent industries .
In the U.K. , besides looking at a law called digital <unk> , it provides private staff to look at civic behavior .
So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a new Internet web , we require a more wider network of Internet freedom .
After all , the company does n't stop eating pollution , or maybe 10 years old , only because they 're going to make a decision to decide that it 's worth making money .
This is the results of the last decade , defending the workforce , maintain and consumers .
Similarly , government does n't just wake up because of the <unk> of <unk> , and it 's the same <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It 's a very long way to look at the political movement of <unk> and right - to - face .
We need to do the same way in the Internet .
We need political innovation .
About 800 years ago , British grandmothers decided to get rid of them , and they forced John King 's big <unk> , but even though it was convinced that there was a range of equations that had to be <unk> .
This took a lot of what we call political innovation , which resulted in the idea of people 's aspiration -- and this is the radical state of the American Revolution .
So what we need to do now is to try to figure out what 's called the " mesh - collaborative desire . "
What should this be ?
Now we do n't know .
But it 's going to require innovation that does n't need to focus on political , <unk> politics , but also to deal with the business of business , creativity , consumer behavior , and even design problems .
Each of us is critical to the world of creation and technology , which is rather than the opposite of the population .
Thank you very much .

And the journalist is <unk> for a few years , for the developing world of the world , doing a bold survey , and it 's about 15 percent of it , which is that the crime network has been driven by the global economy , so his message is not only about <unk> and <unk> <unk> , but even the <unk> of criminal organization , even even <unk> Group .
adventure , crime , economics , global issues , writing

Yves <unk> 's research on global crime networks
Now it 's a very bad economy , and you 're really bad at TED .
So I want you to take a very exciting story for most of the people in the last 20 years .
They 're using their own way they do special ways .
Now , it 's going to be <unk> right now , right now .
I mean there are organizations .
As you know , from a long period of years , there 's a lot of things that have been happening around us , and that 's what it is .
But in the last 20 years , it 's <unk> about 15 percent of the world 's GDP .
I 'd like to call it a " global economy " or " <unk> . "
So what is the viral epidemic of this <unk> crime ?
And of course , there 's the globalization of globalization , <unk> , communication , etc , and so forth .
But first , I want to take you to look at this event , and I want you to look at the Eastern East community .
The most important chapter on Eastern Europe is the most important chapter in the World War .
It 's time for me .
And this is very important for me .
And I used to travel to the Grand Canyon of <unk> , and I went to East Europe to visit the democratic elections of Europe , such as <unk> .
And then I started writing some things about Eastern Europe , and then it turned out that this area was done in <unk> .
When the <unk> billion people ended up getting the choice of choice , I 'm not going to worry about it , but I start worrying about some potential things .
For example , <unk> had never happened before .
And in that chaos , I spent a period of time to understand that the people who were in East Europe have been working on the <unk> , and after the Revolution of Europe .
Obviously , some of them are like ...
But there are some of the signs that we 've never seen in East Europe .
Like this one . Remember the people ?
And they 're often <unk> in four years of <unk> , <unk> and administrators in the <unk> countries , they are <unk> of their lives .
And there 's also a professional apartments in the downtown <unk> , and they 're able to travel freely to the West , where they are <unk> to the West .
This may be surprising , but they played a very important role in this <unk> crisis .
Or I 'm much more willing to call them the <unk> of capitalism .
This is in <unk> change after <unk> .
These pictures were taken in front of the <unk> , and when Eastern Europe was <unk> in the <unk> countries , they were n't just collecting government mechanism .
It means that police and advertisers do n't .
The laws of law ca n't work .
In this case , how do you ensure that capitalism of capitalism in the chaos of chaos in chaos ?
In fact , he might go to the <unk> of a sociologist called " private Laws . "
We normally call them <unk> .
In <unk> , at the end of the day , there 's been a hundred million people who have been dumped in the <unk> industry , and they 've lost jobs in <unk> .
Now , when you 're approaching the economy , it 's going to be a place where a million people will never go to the place . They 're good at looking at the bottom of the sea , building the storm and the bilingual .
But the whole thing happened in the east coast .
Most of the time in the ' 90s , I spent a lot of money on the table , and I spent a lot of bad news .
And so I found that the <unk> of the elders and these leopard institutions are actually a bunch of <unk> people who have organized <unk> .
So I started thinking about a dangerous cow in this violent way .
And then I help the entire world around the world to talk to the <unk> of the police and speak of police , and conversations with those illegal platforms and services .
They 're also talking to <unk> .
<unk> is a place for starting to study .
Why ? Because there 's obviously the law and the order of the <unk> , like <unk> .
And what happened was that I found that <unk> has become a big <unk> <unk> , from the world .
<unk> , women are born to prostitution from <unk> and <unk> .
And what 's the end ?
The destination is the European Union , and it 's been the last time since the Congo River , the benefit of the globalization of globalization has been brought up to the most devastating market market in this history .
And in this five billion people , there are very few people who are willing to spend a lot of time , and they 're going to be able to do it for 50 <unk> , 50 yards away .
In the world of today , there are organizations who are doing things like <unk> and other kinds of other corporations .
It had a lot of building areas , like Afghanistan and Columbia .
It has its own <unk> region , like Mexico and <unk> .
And then , of course , its consumption center , as the European Union , is certainly the United States .
<unk> areas and areas of the world tend to depend on the developing world , and they 're often threatened by severe violence and <unk> .
Take Mexico .
And in the last 18 months , there 's 6,000 people who are killing these sorts of things that are just <unk> .
So what about the <unk> <unk> ?
In 1998 , five million people died .
This is not a conflict you can read in the newspapers , but it 's the biggest conflict that 's happening on our planet .
Why ? Because from the <unk> of the world , the military and the local military personnel united to control their roots in the area .
In 2000 , 80 percent of the glaciers in the world are killing the <unk> areas in southern Europe .
And you can find <unk> in every single meal , and there 's also the laptop and the car controllers .
The war in Congo , <unk> to sell these things to <unk> the force , and then they sell them to the West .
This is the <unk> of the West , and that 's the major motivator .
Now , let me show you some friends that I 'm working on , and they 're wearing the film of <unk> police , who 's in the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of the factory manufacturing is very cheap .
But the European Union wants them to pay the world 's highest revenue .
So if you can go into the <unk> <unk> of the Mississippi , they make a very high amount of profits , and I 'm going to show you that these groups have some kind of resources .
This ship was 100 million <unk> .
There 's nothing bigger than Europe .
From 1994 , seven years later , there were seven percent of the ship that had been successful since <unk> , from <unk> to Italy .
This exercise led to 80 billion dollars across the U.K. .
And these money were used in the <unk> of the war , and there were some <unk> <unk> .
And this kind of practice , in the beginning , has only been the same fast for them to get them to run them .
This is important , because the only way to grab their way is to get them running .
Sometimes the women are <unk> to cook with women , if police intervention , they 're going to get rid of the sea , and the police have to go to the ocean so they do n't continue to bite .
And to show you how much boat you want to do , how many <unk> can be caught .
And the answer is six .
You know , there 's 20 layers of <unk> every day .
What about the <unk> ?
This is to mention globalization , because it 's not just the <unk> of the world .
And the world 's world is <unk> .
It 's so easy to say that money is so easy .
In the last 20 years , it 's an historic age to celebrate <unk> .
In 1990 , we saw the <unk> of the world who compete with their businesses , and they did n't have an effective mechanism to prevent money .
And a lot of legal bank accounts for <unk> , even though it 's very unfortunate , and it does n't ask any question .
The roots of these questions are the Internet networks .
And now these things are the core part of the money , and if you want to stop the legal <unk> , the military personnel , you have to get rid of them .
The good news is that there are some of the people in the White House .
And if anyone is concerned about this , the most important thing about it is to look at the laws of new laws , rules , values that allow us to see his <unk> in jail .
Yves <unk> stole a billion dollars
And this is the most powerful thing that he becomes , and it 's the principal of the three - year - old Jewish criminals who do n't have a lot of <unk> -- and he does n't do it for decades .
So , how many <unk> are in the <unk> ? Or in London , vice versa , <unk> money ?
I 'll tell you , a lot .
Let 's give a " <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> . This is the second <unk> of the last day .
This photo was taken in the middle of <unk> Columbia .
It 's just one percent of the family 's family 's family , one of the <unk> .
Five percent of the GDP per capita in the country .
Now , from Brian <unk> 's <unk> , he 's Canada , and he took me to one of the <unk> <unk> that I went to visit to see a <unk> in the east coast of Nairobi , looking at something that was invaded from the mailbox , where the smallest goal was , of course , that it was a very , very good market for the American <unk> -- and it 's a market that would n't have to be able to do it , because it is a really big market to get to the south ,
Now , I 'm not going to have a lot of impact on the benefits of the major <unk> .
In the beginning of the world , the commercial market for the global market is dramatically enormous .
But there is no increase in resource resources for the resources of crime .
And yet , all of this will change because some of these very strange things happened .
And the United Nations has recognized that this is the last month , realizing the Canadian Revolution , that Canada has become a very important building and <unk> , in <unk> and other forces .
What 's interesting is that markets and <unk> are falling down because these are the ones who are going to evolve for them .
It 's now changing because it 's going to move from the developing world to the West .
And when it happens becomes a trend , it will transcend our <unk> .
And our <unk> police have been <unk> for 40 years , and we 're going to think about it .
Now let 's talk about recession .
Well , there are organizations who are already adapting and adapt them very , very good .
They 're not glamorous in the world 's world , but they 're not glamorous .
And it does n't make sense .
But also , there are two <unk> of risky risks , but it 's really the second thing that they do n't worry about as a member of the other organizational competition , like a nurse .
They 've got threat to the effectiveness of the business .
People do n't have a lot of pills , and they 're not looking for <unk> because the recession is .
And so they get involved in financial crime and entrepreneurial failures , and there are two components of <unk> , one of the other things that <unk> <unk> .
And it 's really successful .
I want to introduce you to <unk> <unk> .
Or even more accurate , <unk> <unk> .
I knew him through a <unk> network .
We sat down in the car , and we sit in the streets of the <unk> .
And through my laptop , no five minutes , he <unk> the computer safety system , and it 's a big bank of Brazil .
That 's really not difficult .
And you can say , very simple , because the <unk> of the Internet is not very high - tech .
The Internet is actually a something that we call social engineering .
Or it 's a new story , every single minute .
It 's easy to imagine that you ca n't imagine people to use their computers most .
But , very quickly , when the Internet <unk> found the fastest channel of <unk> , of course , the <unk> of the other , <unk> <unk> and love of love , love .
And I want you to remember , " I 'm love -- I love a viral epidemic in the world .
And when this virus appeared , I was lucky , because the first one brought me into my <unk> .
She had a lot of emotions for me , and she felt like , " No , love . "
And when I saw these <unk> , my license , I was immediately going to give it a little bit of a lot of trouble with it .
So you 're really careful about the web .
We know that the Web is helping the tools for crime .
They 're carrying innocent people who have free lunch , and they can collect our blood vessel and save our interest .
Now , <unk> <unk> is a very effective medicine that can kill <unk> in the early days .
But in the past year , researchers found that there was something changes happening in the last year , and these <unk> began to appear .
And the researchers were worried about harm , which is because oil is unable to get rid of the market .
But <unk> wrote the <unk> of medicine .
This leads to the <unk> , and these structures did n't have been killed ; they did harm .
And I said that this is because we have to know that there are organizations who are already holding our lives .
You do n't need to go to <unk> or drug equipment , and you can do it with groups .
They influenced our bank account .
They 're influenced by our communication .
They have increased our food and our government .
This is not just a question from <unk> and New York .
<unk> are n't romantic at the 21st century .
They 're a world - of - art business ; they create non - violent and violent violence .
They 're going to be the dominant economic force , and we need very , very serious about this problem .
It 's an honor to talk to you .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> is an assumption of <unk> and <unk> : Think about the <unk> of the animal as an animal of water , and she 's how she thinks about it , how to explain the general scientists to think about <unk> .
<unk> , evolution , science
<unk>
<unk> <unk> says we evolved from the ice
This year is 2009 .
It 's a <unk> anniversary of Darwin .
In the world of <unk> , it 's a 16th - dimensional evolution that <unk> celebrate .
They 're going to inspire us to teach us how to change the way that we think about our minds and how it 's going to kill us .
I said , " It 's almost a lot of other things , because there 's no way of saying .
And they 're trying to <unk> this " facts " to say what they want .
So , now I 'm going to start with the story of this unique story .
Which is , " Why are we so different from the chimps ?
<unk> <unk> tells us that humanity and chimps are almost very different from the gene . It 's really connected .
But when you look at the shape , the chimpanzee is chimps , and people are all different than the people who are <unk> , so they 're <unk> completely .
And I 'm not saying that <unk> <unk> , like culture , or psychology or <unk> .
I 'm saying that it 's fundamentally different from the fundamental difference .
They , in that guy , is the <unk> , with four <unk> .
This guy is flat eyes , and it 's fun to walk , why ?
You know , if I 'm a good Darwin , I have to believe that there 's a reason for that .
If we change the size , we have to be affected by something .
So what happened ?
In 50 years , we have a ridiculous problem .
Everybody knows the answer .
They all know what happens .
The <unk> of the <unk> was left in the tree , and our ancestors came up to <unk> .
And this explains everything .
We have to stand upright , and we can see that the <unk> will be <unk> to animals , or <unk> us , allowing us to use weapons .
We 're going to <unk> the body , so we have to say , " Get rid of your body . "
They all know about this story .
But in the ' 90s , some things started <unk> .
<unk> are more carefully looking to look at the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in the same region of the Renaissance .
They found that they 're not species species .
And then <unk> looked at the <unk> , and they 're not the defender of <unk> .
And then they found a clever way to analyze the pollen .
<unk> , fear .
These are the ones that do n't exist in the <unk> plants .
Some of the things that come from the Grand Canyon are silent .
And this is the fact that we have a situation where we know that our first ancestors lived in the tree , and we 're starting to start doing it all over the course of the trees , the <unk> ecosystem .
That 's not my story .
It 's not <unk> .
Everybody has an idea .
This is from <unk> professors in South Africa .
And he said , " Well , the last 20 years , I 'm telling you what it is . "
We have to return back , we have to go back .
It makes him very upset . They do n't want to go back to the original beginning .
I mean , that would be a scary thing .
You 've already had beautiful patterns , smart patterns .
We have the generation in the generation .
From no one 's trusting .
And what you 're going to do is , you 've got to think of something like this .
And now I was <unk> now .
What do you do about this ? How do scientists do that ?
We know the answer to this question is by written by Thomas Dolby wrote that he wrote in 1962 .
And he said , " Well , what do you do as scientists , when evolution does n't happen or <unk> , and guess what he says ? "
If they do n't have the opportunity , they will not ask questions .
So they say , " Yes , <unk> is wrong , but if you want , suppose it 's right . "
And the only option they do is they stop asking questions .
So they do that now .
That 's why you ca n't hear them . This is a problem .
Some of them will come to the end of the principle .
We 're going to do that .
And the <unk> of Harvard in Harvard said , " How often do you stop <unk> ?
I mean , why do n't we talk about the chromosomes , genes .
And then we 're looking at it .
Darwin must be in <unk> .
If he learned this , " science " .
<unk> with him " <unk> "
And he 's thinking about that .
If you say , " Well , we 're going to stop there . "
The irony is that it turns out that this <unk> system is actually the emergence of the new paradigm .
And now there 's this thing right now .
And it started out there since 1960 , and when the ocean biologist <unk> said , " I think our ancestors might live for a period of time . "
And he took this idea for 30 years .
When the media understood his theories , the pain was <unk> .
All of his <unk> said , this is <unk> .
You make me sick in front of the public .
You can never do that .
And at the time , this is the origin of the <unk> of human ice , which is to say , " It 's like <unk> , like " <unk> " and the atmosphere .
However , I do n't think so .
And I think that <unk> is very important .
I just want to say that some of these are called the fundamental characteristics of human beings and different species of humans and other species .
Let 's look at the skin .
And obviously , when we look at the mammals of the body , we think about <unk> mammals , like <unk> , <unk> dolphin , the <unk> dolphin , the Ross Sea .
Some of them are in <unk> .
And you might wonder , well , what 's the reason we have the human skin <unk> ?
And I talked about it , and people say , " No no , no .
And I said , look at the elephant .
Have you all forgotten ?
In 1982 , I said that elephants might have land .
<unk> .
And she went down , she did n't know what she was saying .
But today , people agree with elephants .
This has become a sense of understanding , and all of the <unk> animals are swimming .
<unk> , <unk> was thought of as a result .
And it turns out that last year , in Florida , found that <unk> <unk> said that most of the time is living in the water .
So the skin skin and the water is <unk> .
And as a naive , it 's just one thing .
You ca n't say all the <unk> are the skin , because look at <unk> .
But you can say all the skin - <unk> animals are all over the lifetime of water , or the ancestor of the water . I think it 's a significant deal .
The only exception is that <unk> <unk> is from no touch from the surface .
They 're flying down .
This is unique because we humans are only the only ones to walk upright upright .
But we can say , all of the leadership and <unk> , if they 're willing to , in a very short period of time .
And there 's only one situation that they 're always going to walk through , and that 's when they get rid of it .
Do you think this <unk> ?
And David <unk> argues that this is important because it 's probably the reason we start walking upright .
Take the fat layer .
We do n't have a very fat animal in our distribution of <unk> .
Why are fat in there ?
And if you look at the <unk> , you 'll know that most of the people in the world have the fat of a mammal stamp on the wing , and they 're waiting for the kidney , when it comes to the skin and the absence of their <unk> .
And for whale sake , this movement is completely <unk> inside the interior , and it 's all in the ocean .
We do n't have to reject this question about our human population , that fat consumption has begun .
Our grandparents have been like this .
The only way to explain why human beings are very , very afraid to be extremely obese , to say to other primates , which is absolutely impossible .
There 's a strange phenomenon , never explaining .
That 's why we speak .
We can speak .
<unk> ca n't , why ?
It does n't matter to the tooth of the teeth , the tongue , the lungs , there 's no relationship for it .
You 're not trained to say , " <unk> <unk> . "
And the only animal has a feeling of consciousness , <unk> , animal , and <unk> birds , and the birds .
This is what you need to talk about .
And also , our bodies are <unk> .
Imagine human water , <unk> water .
If you look at the same action , you can see that you 're pretty close to the size of the fish .
And the idea is , I 've been trying to figure out this idea , and I 'm going to say that this is wrong , it 's not glamorous , it 's not glamorous ; it does n't mean that it is not a priority . It is n't glamorous .
The irony is they kill it , and they 're not going to protect their own version of what they want .
It does n't exist .
They 're killing landmines , and they 're in protecting a vacuum .
And when I say that , how do they respond ?
And one of the things that I 've heard about is that <unk> <unk> is , " This has been studied research .
In the first time they did serious research when they published his papers .
I do n't believe that .
<unk> , I 've been looking for evidence , and even if any accident is now , this is a <unk> .
There is no research research ever .
Sometimes I ask some people , they 'll say I like to land .
Everybody likes to flow up .
And of course they do n't believe it , but it does n't like it .
And I would say , " Why do you think this is a priority ? "
And they said , " Well , ...
Everybody thinks it 's a priority .
They do n't all mistakes , right ?
And the answer is , " Yes , well , yes , they can be wrong . "
There 's a lot of examples in history .
And if you have a scientific problem like this , the problem is that problems are not the ones who are ones in the world , and say , " That 's what people are talking about . "
In addition , some of the <unk> are even more <unk> than the other ones .
Some people have changed the idea .
<unk> professor , he changed the idea .
Daniel <unk> , who changed his <unk> .
David <unk> , he also joined it .
Anybody ? <unk> .
All right .
So now we have the future .
Finally , one of the two things that happened below you will happen at least .
In the next 40 years , 50 , and 80 , or 60 , they might say .
We do n't want to say it , we 'll let it go .
It would be a <unk> result .
And the second thing that happened is that some young geniuses came and said , " I 've found it . "
Not the <unk> , not water , it 's this !
Now , this possibility is n't happening .
And I do n't think there 's a third probability .
So the third thing that really happens is a very beautiful thing .
If you look at a lot of <unk> in the last century , arguments , <unk> , and Darwin , in <unk> .
This is an argument that <unk> Darwin on the new way of thinking about Darwin and <unk> .
I think it will happen in common .
You have a new endeavor .
The idea of <unk> and Darwin is going to be <unk> together .
And then we ended up with a number of times later .
They 're all very glamorous places .
For me , <unk> .
Because I said , " Well , I 've been in the age of <unk> , when I 'm in my age . "
So what does it happen ?
And I can tell you three <unk> .
He said no .
And they decided that they were going to be <unk> in 1960 , and they said , " They 're <unk> . "
It 's really easy to change their mind .
They 're not going to get rid of it .
The textbook is n't <unk> .
There 's nothing wrong about the skin that we 're not talking about .
And it 's only about trying to figure out how to follow <unk> .
All of us have never seen the opportunity to connect with the <unk> of the dictionary .
So I do n't know where the <unk> came from .
From all of the millions of people who have released this <unk> , it says " <unk> . "
If you want to grow up in the area , if you think about it , you do n't believe it 's the best to say , because it <unk> you .
So I have a feeling that some of the scientific institutions become a kind of a <unk> .
But you know , this makes me feel good because Richard tells us how to react to him .
And he said , " First , you 're going to reject him all the fears of his fears and <unk> . "
Okay , so I 'll do it .
Secondly , he said , " Do n't worry . "
That 's what I do .
Thank you very much .

When Chris has invited me to talk to me at TED , I reject him , because I could n't do it with audiences , but I wanted to go .
TED is a big meeting .
But he explained to me that he could n't find special , glamorous and TED conference , and I said , well , I 'm going to tell you , " Well , <unk> -- I want to have two conditions .
Number one : I 'm going to start with the beginning of my talk at the beginning .
So the second thing that I 'm going to have is the theme of a speaking theme in the ' 50s ' ' 80s .
And fortunately , he agrees that ! Two years later you 'll see the theme of my talk , " <unk> <unk> image . "
I 've invented a camera that 's going to work with <unk> .
In fact , it 's not a shot of paper , but this guy 's very cheap , you 're always going to feel there .
<unk> , how beautiful day , <unk> day -- let me hope you and your family ! And I know that this letter is going to make you very close , but it 's not something that you do n't want to do , and it does n't matter what you 're doing with your life , so that it is a very <unk> way of looking at what 's going on in my life . And that 's what I 'm looking for .
And I 'm a gentleman who 's <unk> , who is dead , <unk> - <unk> -- [ <unk> ] [ " <unk> <unk> " ] -- <unk> is the West of Africa . But he 's in the civil war .
You know your country is a state of economic investing , and your people are very trusted by the business of the commercial , where I give you your letter .
And before my dad died , he had <unk> billion dollars , and these money could make him go away from those <unk> .
These are the people who are trying to <unk> the <unk> of the country in the world , and when the war comes out of wars , the creator of a war allows me to send his money to him , but my dad has been rejected because he does n't kill the money , because his dad refused to join the net money .
Meanwhile , in this world , only my mom knows that this money , because my dad always goes to me .
And I was very quickly at church International who 's going to take this money on the Red Cross to send money to the <unk> airport , even though they do n't know what this box is .
Our family is a very safe , <unk> - <unk> company in Bangalore , and I 'm just going to think about it as a <unk> <unk> .
I do n't want to invest in this money in Thailand because it 's bad because there 's no economic recession .
I just wanted you to help me with a gun , and I knew that the first thing you helped me to do is to become a silence , to accept that money in the center of your account ; the second one , the number of dollars to the bank that you 're going to have to get out of his account , <unk> the money where you 've got to go out and get it to you .
It 's <unk> <unk> .
It 's really <unk> .
I was told in <unk> , and I had 18 minutes .
But I just had 15 minutes .
So , in order to make this cool , I 'm here for the next three minutes .
I 'm very upset .
<unk> you ?
Mark <unk> , this is a very cool name , ooh , <unk> .
Is n't you a little girl ? Are you guys ?
I mean , do n't I say that from TED ?
Right ? Oh , so you 're like a thousand people like this , 2,000 people in some ways ? Huh ?
You do n't understand what I 'm saying .
Ah , Mark <unk> .
<unk> , right ?
There is nothing wrong about this .
There is nothing wrong about this .
Yeah , my <unk> and some of those guys are <unk> .
Very cool . Well , we 're timing .
And they tell me that Google software is very advanced . It will be in your lifetime with Google to serve you , so it predicts what you do next .
As I said , " <unk> , it 's crazy . "
But they say , " No , but do n't say it . They 're not .
And they said I could make a difference .
So , for example , my name is telling me , and I have to tell you that it 's not a very mature software -- this is a real network -- that 's the real Google website , which is the Google site .
So what am I going to say ? That 's me . This is me .
Am I lucky ?
Am I lucky ?
Yes , audiences .
<unk> , ooh , amazing .
And in August of 2001 , I 'm doing my love for <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm going to put it on the website , and this will include my best friends as a invited , inviting birthday to my 26 birthday birthday .
You know Monday , more than a million people per day .
In the week of a week , I 've got a call from the <unk> network , and I have more than 10 dollars per day , so I 'm going to increase them with 3,000 dollars .
No , no , I could n't believe my job .
As you 've seen , finally , I became a storyteller .
But there are some people who are not just the Internet , or if it 's a Ph.D. or a tutor .
I know something like this .
And I 'm really hard to explain that complex philosophy , I do n't want to understand it , because it 's a bit of a <unk> , but -- but unfortunately I did n't have a lot of time explaining .
Maybe I 'll come back next year and say this .
I 'm very proud of email , and I know a lot about it .
After four years later , I 'm going to get out of that every day , 300 to 300 . They do n't know that people are a great opportunity to understand different cultures , right ?
It 's like a microscope looking at the whole world .
You do n't even have the rest of your life . I 've got a lot of inspired from regular users .
For example , some people wrote me .
And they said , " Hey , do you get to the Grand Canyon ? " You can do it with us . "
They said , " Hey , <unk> , thank you very much , but I mean we 've done it .
It 's really <unk> .
But as you know , this is what 's called a collaboration . In collaboration with my fans , I have to say , " Yes . "
I 've heard a lot of people in the audience .
And I know what you 're saying , " What 's the damn thing you 've been talking about , and how do he <unk> it ? "
I have to say , this year is n't me .
I think Chris must be sure , because in the past few years , I guess there are some <unk> speakers on TED . I do n't know .
So , this year , Chris introduced us to Doug Engelbart .
It 's going to make us feel a little bit more likely to stand up on the stage to get us home , so we have a whole lot of experience for this talk .
And I have to say , it 's really cool here .
I want to tell you a little joke , but not a big deal .
You can play people who are <unk> people .
Voices : Hey , fast , fast .
<unk> : You 're <unk> .
Voice : We want to see <unk> <unk> .
You 're eating our time .
I want to say that last thing , I 'm really saying -- thank you so much .
<unk> style .
I was against a <unk> .
This is true . Some people say they say , they said , <unk> , you 're doing a bunch of things , but you do n't make any money .
Why ? I said , " Mom , dad -- <unk> -- I say , you know , I do n't know whether you realize that you 're aware , and that video game is playing video games , so there 's a couple of money on the market .
I mean , like 10 years , I spent the last year . So I decided to try my <unk> .
My own mind is a video game .
This game is called " <unk> . "
I think kids have to love this game .
See , I 'm walking around . What 's going on ?
So that does n't repeat the same thing .
I understand why you 're not .
I try to change the pattern , and you 've done this .
The Buddhist , of course , looks very similar to " <unk> . "
And then you become a <unk> .
This is a very good game because you know about 25 cents per gallon you can <unk> this game .
Chris once said , " Well , we should have some new things for TED in the TED conference .
So I made this for TED , which is " <unk> . "
It 's just a series of <unk> .
And I hope it will be a little bit better .
Do n't you have anything ? Well , good choice .
We wait for the second one -- it 's a number one to 500 <unk> .
So what do we do here ? Oh , just a technology joke .
For me , technology sounds very important for me because I 've got a lot of happiness from technology .
In fact , we 're making something that needs to use these techniques , and I 'm going to tell you that even though I have a spell on my head , I do n't -- insist on making things that make fun .
It 's a process of creation , and this process has been kept me in my life . This is what I 've done about 80 percent of the project , but I still have a lot of things to do , because you do n't have one thing , you ca n't start a different thing .
And what I 've done is , I started to get interested in creating the <unk> of <unk> , and to share it with you .
We 're in a culture of <unk> , and we 're hard to use some software because they 're very difficult to do it . People say they have to read a <unk> .
So , I 've tried -- I 'm trying to make a little bit of work . I hope they 're going to get people to learn to express themselves .
I 'm serious , but I try to make a sense of creating a kind of meaningful environment , and this environment is made for people .
And I create a competition called " <unk> attacking , " and I think there are some people who are special at work .
In the three weeks , there 's 500 percent .
People in the country are doing an incredible watch .
online tools -- you might have seen a lot of these .
I think this is really magic .
I think it 's a good opportunity to create a lot of opportunities , or <unk> other things , and I 'm very interested in this process , which is the process that I really prefer .
And the problem is that a lot of people are <unk> in the painting , and they do this in this way , like , for example , a few characters .
And eventually , they stop painting , and they draw some kind of stuff like <unk> .
So , this kind of <unk> writers try to create tools that make <unk> .
In other words , a <unk> .
You can also draw a little bit of <unk> , like a kind of a <unk> in your creation , like a war German .
And that 's what you can do -- oh , in fact , you 're going to draw a little bit better , even though it 's bad , but we 're moving , and we start to get out of this process , which is , although there 's no value , it looks beautiful .
And here are some of the things that I like . This is a little portrait of <unk> , which is very cool .
<unk> , beautiful stuff .
I mean this is absolutely incredible . This is an 11-year - old portrait of the <unk> of 11 girls .
I actually died . In fact , it 's not a joke .
But I think this is a very interesting , wonderful thing .
So this is what 's called " <unk> Project . " This is -- it 's -- that 's a <unk> message , which requires collaboration .
This is <unk> <unk> .
There 's no <unk> <unk> , which is the same thing , in fact , that no line is written in a different point .
I think this is " now <unk> , " " suck <unk> . " And I 'm holding it right now , she starts doing it . "
And I 'll tell you , this is really amazing , if you are , or whatever you get , who can go to my home , say , " Let me talk about it . "
But like this is just the opposite of the circle , but let 's bring people together , doing some happy things .
In fact , they want to understand each other . This is just a low - tech ratio , but I think it 's important . It 's a lot of social capital , and we 're currently currently losing it , so far . So , I like academics .
And it would be dance to music , and it was a surprise , in <unk> , it 's an amazing <unk> remix . He started doing some kind of stuff .
I was interested in puppets , I 'm going to show you the final thing .
Oh , how do you make puppetry .
Chris Anderson : Ladies and gentlemen , <unk> Frank !

<unk> <unk> says that politicians are strange creatures . Making ways to focus on your problem , the best way to tinker with you is to write a month , and the telephone shows why traditional <unk> are more powerful than email and <unk> -- and also sharing a good four steps .
business , culture , politics , social change
<unk>
Yves <unk> : <unk> political processes
One thing that is <unk> is that you 're passionate about TED , and that 's what you have to manage to manage .
You do n't care a lot about you .
But you 'll notice you need voting committee to make you wrong .
How do you do that ?
And I can tell you one thing , I 've been exploring it for a while , and I 'm going to show you a little bit about the experience of the channel .
So when you think about the politicians , you have to realize that they 're strange creatures .
It 's not just how they do n't have their own <unk> , and they 're very surprised about how you 're supposed to be with them .
What we need to know is , what fuels the organisms of politics ?
There are two fundamental principles of <unk> that are <unk> in politicians .
These are major tools who are most dominant tools to do what he does .
The second thing is , they 're not like other animals , and most of the population is <unk> , and this is self - protected .
And maybe you think that money is crucial , but it 's just a <unk> <unk> , and I have to do it myself .
Now , the point is that these animals have been reported in front of this .
What is it that 's going to happen , and what makes you tick ?
You can email them to them .
But unfortunately , I always have a lot of <unk> ads , and your email is lost .
Okay , that 's okay .
So the call is <unk> .
Okay , so often it 's a robot speaking , and they go back to the telephone , they say no .
It does n't work .
Maybe that might be useful , but that 's really hard .
It 's often hard to get effective response and communicating .
Yeah , <unk> can actually get a lot of attention and a good discussion , but it 's still a bit of <unk> .
So what do you do ?
And the answer may be really incredible .
This is what it is .
We live in a digital era , but we 're still <unk> creatures .
The letters was very useful .
And even if we 're in the president , they 're going to read a lot of people every day with employees .
And I can tell you that every strategy in my work is telling you , they 've got the letters and their meaning .
So why do n't you stop ?
First of all , you 've got to find a traditional device .
I know what you 're going to do is to adapt a little bit about how it 's right , but that 's really important .
And the most important thing is , you have to <unk> this letter .
And this was very rare , and someone had this old tool called me .
Secondly , I 'm going to remind you how to use a positive gesture , at least to write a letter for the consumer penguin .
And I 'm going to assure you that if you do n't think about it , three months later , it will start to call them when you 're trying , and you ask you , " How do you see this ? "
Now , I 'm going to suggest that you have a book that uses four <unk> structures .
When you get rid of these animals , you need to know that they 're closer to their dangerous dangers , and you have to get closer .
So in <unk> , I 'm very simple to you .
You might n't even appreciate each other , you do n't like anything else , but you can start with them .
When animals want to get something , they get it .
They do n't spend time on their time .
So your whole opportunity .
The second second , you can actually say that your position is in your heart .
When you do that , do n't drive anyone to do something .
<unk> will lose you .
<unk> when animals are attacked or threats when they 're attacked , so you have to give them a <unk> .
Most of the time , if they found a <unk> , they would choose <unk> .
Obviously you 're good .
Once you have the correct <unk> , you 'll make the right decision .
Then you want to be a trained expert .
You become safe safe areas .
So in <unk> , you 'll tell people , " If nobody 's going to give you these information , I 'm going to help you . "
And animals love <unk> , they <unk> two things , and they 're going to <unk> you , or you 're trying to attack you .
And you 're going to tell them about the writing of the letter .
You 've done some of the projects you 've got , you 're volunteers ; some other things you have .
Why is this important ?
Because this suggests that two political technologies are most dominant , and that 's where you have the big effects and my advertisers have to rely on you .
Here you have a very useful little skill here , especially for TEDsters .
You should be like this .
First , you go to the local <unk> <unk> .
And then you get a helmet .
And if you do that , they say , " Are you there ? "
So some staff would say , " Oh , that 's a very important letter . "
And your letter is that you go into the dictionary , and then the leadership has to read this letter .
So what you 've got to tell you is that I have to say , we 're all in a party with politicians .
We 're listening to them , and they 're sold to be sold , but it 's a chance to engage the opportunity to communicate .
When I first went to the first time , I got this letter , and I had this letter , and I took it to every leopard .
This is the opportunity to talk about , and if you have this leopard and wanting to communicate it very important .
So once you do that , I guarantee you that you will become the defender of the storm .
Take <unk> .

<unk> <unk> is using <unk> tools to explore how we interact with each other and the world , and in this strange , <unk> talk , she shows the " <unk> of the <unk> , " and " selective <unk> " "
art , communication , culture , productivity
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : The art of <unk> communication
I am <unk> <unk> .
I like to make devices that we use when they use them .
So I have a lot of interest in what we 're seeing in the world , how we interact with our world .
So I 'm going to tell you a little bit about what I want to talk about , and I am a artist and a scientist and a scientist .
I teach the physics of physics and <unk> .
Most of the devices I 've done , or in some way , is in a certain way .
So every time I introduce you to the realm of what 's important , why the body is important .
Actually this is very simple .
Everybody , all of you , have bodies .
I 'm going to assure you , every person here is sitting there in front of the <unk> chairs , and it 's used to use the car .
Do n't look shy .
This is one of our common bodies in common that we interact with the world .
So whether it 's an interaction , or a interactivity - based artist , an interactive installation that is really a very glamorous area that can be used in the body , and the inside of your body , or the <unk> of the body .
So my work with <unk> and tools .
And so I can use all sorts of things to communicate , from the radio <unk> to <unk> and <unk> .
And then I 'm going to introduce you to some of the devices that I do from the easiest panel .
It went back to a couple of years ago , and I sat back in the subway for a few years and I was thinking about thinking about it .
I do n't think much more .
So I 'm thinking about how to use this kind of thing , if I can collect all these sounds -- like , I think , the sounds of the sound that I feel in the physics , and then I 'll share them into a specific form of forms , so I can share them with other people .
So when I went back to home , I made a <unk> figure .
And I 'm going to name her name for a <unk> cap because it allows you to stack them out of the <unk> , and you can get them to share with others .
So I kept doing other rocks .
This one I call " <unk> . "
Very impressive .
It creates a conversation for you .
When you speak , your voice is actually <unk> into your ears .
So when I 'm making these things , it does n't work in the installation , but it 's on the device .
So what happens when you stack this up ?
How do they have a experience ?
And they do what they need to change .
So a lot of these devices are actually the way we interact with each other .
This particular device is called the " <unk> <unk> . "
It 's a tool that allows people to hear their interior .
And some of the devices are more <unk> to express and communication .
And as the stress of this inflatable organ , it 's an outside organ that can use it to express themselves .
They can be <unk> and <unk> based on their emotions .
And they 're able to express it , from <unk> and <unk> to fear and apathy .
There are some devices that are actually used for <unk> .
This <unk> is a device for <unk> .
It <unk> that kind of emotion , but it 's going to absorb the word " weird " of <unk> .
And finally , there 's a couple of devices that are just invitations .
This is a piece of a thing that goes on with the name of this thing , and the rest of it can be able to catch your ear .
And despite the fact that I was really interested in relationship with the relationship between people , I also think about the way we interact with the world .
A few years ago , when I was in New York , I thought about a lot of building buildings around me , and how do I feel better with them .
I thought , " Hey yeah .
Maybe I want to make a better connection to the wall , maybe I should be more like the wall .
So I did a <unk> wall , and I would like to raise it like a <unk> .
And then I was on top of it , and I felt like I could do it with my own space , and I could do it for me .
So now , let 's start with the environmental growth of the world to the natural world , and I have a project that 's called plants , which is called " plants Phone , " which allows us to move inside plants to connect .
So when a plant <unk> , it can <unk> the telephone , or the service site , and the site of the <unk> site .
It will change the interaction of the plants , because a small sphere is able to express the demand for thousands , thousands of people , in each other .
And so I mentioned the scale of scale , the last most <unk> , of course , of the ice .
And so the <unk> of the ice is so many great reasons to make me deeply obsessed with , but I 'm interested in the relationship to the <unk> .
Because it seems to be <unk> .
The ice is moving through us .
They 're constantly <unk> and <unk> , and some of them are completely silenced .
I live in Canada , so I 've been trying to show you a ice in Canada .
This is really interesting because in the South , it 's the largest one in North America .
They 're going to bring these buses into the ice , and they 're able to get people out of the surface of the ice .
And that makes me think about my first experience .
And when I first met the <unk> , I asked how to do it .
This is not a social anesthesia <unk> .
I do n't even know how to do it .
Am I going to make a little bit more ?
Or what I need to do is to make a ice that 's the ice and the fall of the wing and the ice ice cream ice .
Or what I need to do is to make a conversation like a ice cream that can zoom in my voice when I talk about the water .
But one of the most <unk> experiences I 've ever had was a good relationship to listen to .
It was a lot of <unk> for my influence .
This is a little change in the way that I 'm in my physical direction .
And since we use devices to work with the world , I have also done a device called <unk> <unk> .
And it 's made of materials using a <unk> material that can regulate the <unk> of human contact and <unk> .
And again , it 's inviting to ask people to <unk> the ice and give them a <unk> .
So this is just the beginning .
It 's all about thinking about this project .
Like the <unk> wall , I hope I can do more like a wall on this project , and I certainly want to be more <unk> .
So my goal is to take the future for the next decade to do a series of <unk> and different kinds of artists , and technology , scientists , researchers and scientists in this <unk> project .
Now I just want to say that we 're in this period of communication and device , which is very exciting , but I think real importance is to think about how we can continue curiosity and <unk> , and the tools we need to do with the world , the way we use it and our methods .
Thank you .
<unk>
In Pennsylvania , in the ' 80s , to save it , <unk> Armstrong thinks of architecture in traditional materials , we need to self - repair architecture . She provides a <unk> that can repair and conservatives .
architecture , art , biology , design , development , life , science , sustainability , technology
<unk>
Armstrong Armstrong : self - <unk> architecture
Now , all of the buildings have a common common .
That 's all <unk> technology .
<unk> and industrial manufacturing , and also a group of workers to build .
And this leads to a negative outcome .
This is a total energy cycle that goes from nature to our cities and home .
So that 's not sustainable .
And I think the only way to build sustainable homes and cities is to connect them with the natural environment instead of <unk> .
Now , for doing this , we need a correct language and nature .
Life systems associated with nature , in the natural world , through a series of <unk> <unk> .
And this dialogue is something that is <unk> into a certain kind of dialogue , which is a conversation that goes into the other , and <unk> energy or absorbs energy .
This is a way to change local resources in sustainable ways , which is that it 's going to transform resources into sustainable methods for sustainable resources , to shift the resources for <unk> .
So , I 'm very interested in using something that is very exciting to the building .
But this material is n't , I 'm going to create them .
And I 'm working together in the <unk> building in <unk> , <unk> architects , and also , we 're working with the international scientists to create this new object .
That means we 're going to create it .
<unk> Martin is a very interested in one of the things that we 're dealing with with <unk> and conservatives .
That 's exactly what we 're working on in the developing world .
Martin uses a system called " <unk> <unk> . "
And this is the magic thing , and it 's a dog . There 's a <unk> .
But there is no DNA .
And this is something that is only a little bit of life .
It can move in itself .
It 's a very high amount of <unk> .
They can have complex changes . They 're happy architects .
Look at these <unk> cells to replicate the environment .
We do n't know how they do it .
So this is also a <unk> cell , and it 's trying to figure out the skin .
It 's a kind of <unk> hero .
It 's a hard process .
This is an abnormal cells that can be separate from the atmosphere , and this is a <unk> cell than a heat cell from a atmosphere .
This is the <unk> of those <unk> .
They do n't get a part of it .
So what we 're doing is trying to try and try to make these techniques to create a kind of a bottom - line approach , and now the <unk> of <unk> , which can <unk> materials .
They 're more advanced .
And this material actually has a long story .
Our ancestors used to use them in buildings .
If you get out of the Oxford city , watching these buildings -- these days , I love this -- you can see a lot of all sorts of things to do it .
If you look at the <unk> , you can see that there are little <unk> and small bones each .
They were <unk> millions of years .
This is a very interesting thing to do .
This looks beautiful .
But imagine what this rocks would be like if it could always be talking to the atmosphere .
Maybe they can <unk> CO2 .
Would it be that the <unk> of this <unk> ?
The most likely is it grows .
It might be self - <unk> , even more complex changes than the environmental changes of the environment , and even a lot of variation .
And the opposite of architecture does n't really feel like a special material .
And he 's going to think more , right ?
So when we think about more metabolic material , we can start to look at ecological intervention , like <unk> , or in the area of the city .
These are examples of Florida .
You know , Tony and the oceans have constant relationships , and it built on the <unk> .
So , we 've developed a way to change the way that <unk> cells are evolving .
The architect <unk> , the architect , came up with a series of designs that could enable cities under the bottom of the city to improve the city .
This is the technology we have now .
This is our " <unk> " technology that 's effectively a kind of a shell , like the earliest limestone , and the canoe is the bedrock of complex materials .
So now , we 're working on this <unk> of <unk> cooperation .
It 's a very interesting part .
We do n't want to make these limestone straight into these beautiful clouds .
We need them to grow around where they 're growing around .
You 've got these <unk> cells around the top of the light .
We look at this phenomenon in the lab .
They can get away from light .
They can also be <unk> , and you 're just going to pick up their species .
So , they 're not in one entity , we 're <unk> them .
Now , these cells are now <unk> to <unk> a little bit of blind , <unk> <unk> , and it 's focused on Hewlett - Packard .
But they 're not going to be able to do it immediately .
It takes a few years to improve and monitor this technology in an arbitrary case , in a case in Florida .
But also , when these buildings have been taught , we 're going to see a city that 's <unk> out of the underside of the city .
And self - destructive is a process of carbon - <unk> .
This will also have the impact on the local ocean , and it 's going to find themselves in this ecosystem .
This is really interesting , now we have a kind of technique that can combine the city with nature , through a direct way .
But the best thing about this is that this technology is useful in any place .
This is an ecology of chemical chemistry , and we 've all done that . This is what it means for the developing world .
So to conclude , I 'm looking at the metabolism of the <unk> , as a <unk> of <unk> technology in architecture .
And also , these are the characteristics of the <unk> of life , which means they work with their lives .
They 're very keen with architecture .
And finally , if one of the people in the future look at these beautiful buildings , he could n't have these buildings that Nature is nature , or humans .
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> is made of the purpose of loss and saving lives , and <unk> the development of Google - flapping cars . Fantastic videos show up in the fields of Hewlett - <unk> , where it 's a car accident , from the <unk> of TED2011 .
Talks

<unk> <unk> : A car from Google
As a boy , I love cars .
When I was 18 , I had my best friends in a car accident .
It 's like this .
And I decided to do it every year to save a million people a year .
And so I did n't have a success , so it 's just an article , and I 'm going to tell you some about <unk> cars .
And the first time I learned this was to <unk> the <unk> of the military Foundation , and in the middle of <unk> , it 's going to be a member of a hundred - year - old cars that can be done by the U.S. government .
And even though there were Yves consultants , there was no car to get to the end .
So we decided to build a different car in Stanford .
It includes electric hardware and software .
We 've got it to learn the skills that we drive , and then we 're going through the desert .
What happened was that it was the first time : it turned back to the car - <unk> car competition -- and this is for two million dollars .
But I do n't have any life .
And by the time , we started to focus on a street where any streets in California could drive themselves .
We 've got 14 million miles away .
By the way , we can see the things that our cars are able to see around it and how it 's going to make assumptions .
It 's a perfect drive machine .
We drive it in the city like San Francisco .
We also went through it on the <unk> of San Francisco to Los Angeles .
And we 've met <unk> , frozen lanes , and none of these processes do n't have <unk> ; it 's completely autonomous .
In fact , we took 14 million miles , no one noticed that this was a <unk> car .
<unk> , <unk> and night , even in San Francisco .
And sometimes our cars are crazy .
Guy : Ooh , my God .
What ?
Another man : it 's driving .
<unk> : Now I ca n't let my friends whisper , but I can do something for other people .
Can you know that driving accidents are the first big cause of death deaths ?
Can you notice that almost all of these accidents are made of human mistakes rather than machine , so whether we can let machines protect us ?
Do you realize that we can increase the <unk> of two to three times a mile to 300 times the accuracy of the human being -- and we 're trying to optimize the position of a car where they 're going to drive over the road , and then you can stop the highway in the corner ?
Are you aware of everybody in the room when you 're going to spend 52 minutes per day on the transportation , right ?
You can <unk> these moments .
It 's about 40 billion hours across the U.S. alone .
At the same time , <unk> billion gallons of gallons .
Now I have a new technology , and it allows us to look at the future that we 're going to think about how ridiculous our generation is to drive the car .
Thank you .

Rob <unk> : How to make the market flow
This is a river .
This is a <unk> .
This is a river .
<unk> around country .
There are thousands of miles of water in the U.S.
In this map , color region shows the water conflict .
Same problem in East Asia .
And because of the other , it 's the difference between detail .
It 's only about 40 miles across the river .
They 're usually going to die of fish and other wildlife .
They 're the blood vessel blood vessels , usually they 're usually dry blood vessel .
I want to tell you a story about these bears , because it 's the origin of the story .
This is <unk> <unk> .
And it goes through a human region , and <unk> goes into the <unk> chamber .
There 's all sorts of wildlife , including <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Almost every year in the last hundred years , it looks like this in summer .
How do we get to this stage ?
Well , back to the 19th century , people began to live in places like <unk> .
Anyway , there 's a lot of water there , and so many people .
But when more people have come to the water , the first time people are starting to have a little bit of compassion , and in <unk> , <unk> passed through the old water .
It 's a very simple thing to tell you about water .
<unk> , a lot of people tend to share the water , and the first people will be very concerned about this , but the lawyers are very concerned about it .
In <unk> and 2003 , it 's all about <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , one of the founders of <unk> <unk> in <unk> is the first time where people are born , or higher , higher water .
It matters very important .
The problem is that the West looks like this .
Some of those rivers are more than 50 times higher than 100 times per year .
And the more high - tech <unk> , if they do n't claim that they 're responsible for their water , the risk of the <unk> values , and the amount of economic values .
So they did n't manage to protect the water .
It 's not just a bunch of people ; it 's the system of <unk> , because if you think about it , it will lose it .
So the experience of experience has been over over decades and decades , and now we still have this .
This is a system of <unk> .
It <unk> the protection of the water because , you do n't claim your water power .
I 'm sure that all of you know that this is a significant conflict between agriculture and the community .
Okay . Let me change .
Most of you are happy to understand that part of the talk is free , and knowing some of those people will be happy .
There 's another thing over the country , and it 's a company that 's starting to look at their water levels .
They care about the safe water of the water , and they try to do it in the store , they 're concerned about how they use water .
Okay , this is a <unk> problem , but I want to tell you another story about beer .
I bet you do n't know what you 're going to do with a beer - worth of beer .
If you stack up all the <unk> , it 's going to be more than a hundred thousand gallons of water .
Now , <unk> is doing a lot of <unk> to reduce water , but they still still use millions of gallons of water .
I mean , water in Brazil .
So what do they do for a very big amount of water , and what can they do ?
These ecosystems are really important for <unk> and their clients .
After all , in water and fishing , it 's also linked to a certain amount of ice and ice and ice .
So <unk> and their clients are worried about what they 're looking for .
How do they solve this water cycle ?
Remember the Swiss <unk> .
And so far , the business of commercial air has always been measured and accelerating , and we 're trying to make the next step .
Remember the Swiss <unk> .
It 's a system of clothing .
It <unk> the protection of water , because you do n't claim that your water is holding it .
All right , we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of water - disposal , and it 's a world that has the same amount of resistance to these bears .
In some state , high water <unk> can allow them to stay in the water , and also illegal to protect their water force .
After all , this is their water power , and if they want to predict the power of the fish , they do it right now .
But they did n't do that .
So , with local <unk> , we 've created a kind of motivation .
We paid them to stay in the water .
This is what happens .
And this guy made the choice , and it took it to the water .
And he did n't lose the power of the water , and he 's only serving this power , or the rights , it 's not going to go into the water .
Because he 's the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and he can protect the harm of the water from the river .
Right ?
He was paid to keep water in the water .
And he 's looking at the stream of measuring water .
And then we took the measurements of the water , and we divided it into thousands of <unk> .
Each one of them has a cabinet and a <unk> , and then the rest of the <unk> bought these <unk> as a way to <unk> water .
That 's the end of the river .
This provides a simple , cheap approach to <unk> the ecosystem to the <unk> , and give a economic route and an economy to care about their water levels .
After a hundred years of conflict and 100 years , a struggle for <unk> and <unk> did n't solve the problems of a market based on the market , where I 'm going to ask you to do a solution to it -- this solution does n't require <unk> .
This is the fact that people who care about their water levels are really the real opportunity to go to the place where the water goes to <unk> , and at the same time it provides the right economy for farmers to provide farmers .
These trade - backed people are not luxuries .
They make people connect and not separate them .
This is a continent that creates economic support for the village .
And most importantly , it 's a effect .
We have over tens of thousands of dollars of ecosystems with <unk> water .
We <unk> the power of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , Oregon , <unk> - <unk> company , a lot of high - tech companies that have been connected to it .
And when we make these connections , we can do it .
Thank you very much .

Google 's " <unk> <unk> " tells you how it works in their everyday business , and it 's based on its bold neighbors .
business , charter for compassion , culture
<unk>
<unk> : On the Google <unk> <unk>
So what 's the happiest person in the world ?
Not like me .
And he should be .
His name is <unk> <unk> .
How do you become the happiest person in the world ?
There 's actually a way of looking at people in the brain .
And you can detect the functions of the brain , <unk> <unk> , slightly more than the frontal lobe cortex and the right frontal cord .
It turns out that the synthesis of happiness measured the results before the result of the record .
And he 's the most happiest man in the world to see the happiest person in the world .
And that makes us think about a problem : what is he looking at ?
Maybe some of the ideas of <unk> .
And indeed , he 's at meditation .
It says that the experience of heart has to have the most happy times .
It 's a vital story to read in my life .
My dreams are in my lifetime , and in the world , it 's going to have to do it for the sake of peace and all kinds of minds and people who have the heart to make it happen .
Let me learn me from a new way of looking at my work .
The <unk> of the brain scans shows that <unk> <unk> is not a <unk> .
<unk> makes happiness .
The heart is interesting .
And this exciting idea can change the whole game .
Because , if you have mental pressure , nobody can do it .
But if you have a heart is interesting , everyone will do it .
So for all of you who have minds in the world , what we need to do is to manage the stress of <unk> stress as a fun thing .
But that 's not very interesting .
What if you have a heart of mind ?
What if it could also be brought ?
So , every police in the world , each manager would want to have a heart -- like this .
This will make the world happen .
So I started to focus on the context of the economy , the heart of the mind .
And fortunately , I did n't get a lot of time .
Because I 'm going to figure out what 's going on in Google , and I 'm here .
I know that there are other sorts of <unk> companies in the world , but Google 's familiar platforms because I 've been working on it for 10 years , so I 'm doing this Google analysis analysis .
Google is an actor .
This is an achievement .
Maybe it 's because of the heart , the pressure is <unk> in the corporate direction .
In Google , businesses are always the same pattern .
It 's an interesting pattern .
It 's starting to start with a little bit of a Google employee doing something .
They do n't usually remind permission , but it 's going to work directly with other employees .
Sometimes , for the sake of people , scale becomes a political event .
So in other words , it 's almost entirely from the bottom .
Let me give you one example .
And the first example is that the largest year in the world -- from Google to Google , from three employees to the local community , is based on three teams , because the size of the scale has been developed because scale scale .
Another example , three Google staff , a engineer , an engineer who has a more interesting thing , and three of them understood that India is in the area of 20 people , there 's no medical framework .
What do they do ?
And they 're just beginning to start with <unk> .
If you raise enough money , they build a hospital in the hospital for 20 <unk> hospital .
In the Haiti earthquake , a lot of engineers in the earthquake and products of buildings united together to work together , trying to figure out how to create a tool to help the dead .
The same mind acts in our international <unk> .
For example , in China , the largest social community of China Foundation came in , and the competition of the Chinese , for instance , has been involved in 1,000 schools , like education , poverty .
And all of the systems in the system made in Google to make a social responsibility to create a social commitment to support these <unk> .
And this idea is that it comes from <unk> two to two people in their work , and they 're participating in jobs .
And what I think is interesting is that social responsibility is not one of the most important industries of corporate industries .
It 's like two people say , " We do this . " And the company said , " Okay . "
So we found that Google has <unk> companies because Google employees found a lot of fun .
But that 's not very interesting .
This is what really matters .
What ?
The first benefit of this is that it 's a mesh - driven company , which is highly entrepreneurial .
What does that mean ?
The heart has three components .
<unk> is emotional , and , " I am with you . "
And the second is cognitive <unk> , " I understand you . "
The other thing is , " I want to help you . "
So what does this have to do with leadership ?
Jim Axelrod has studied it , and he shows it from " Good <unk> , " especially special , special leaders to make a company from good to excellence .
And this leader is going to become " <unk> leaders . "
These leaders are not only capable of abilities and there are two important qualities that are <unk> and <unk> .
These are <unk> <unk> .
It 's because they do n't think they 're not going to expand them .
It turns out that these people are always the most powerful corporate company .
If you look at the quality of these qualities , we found that the cognitive quality and emotions of the patient -- understand and compassion -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> me .
<unk> is driven by heart force .
<unk> pressure : <unk> leaders .
This is the first <unk> of <unk> .
The second irony is that the heart is creating huge labor .
<unk> inspire each other to get better .
It can create a very strong community of <unk> , and people are familiar with each other .
I mean , you go to work in the morning and you 're just trying to figure out the hospital in India .
How do you get these people ? This is your own colleague .
So this <unk> <unk> can promote cooperative partners and creative creativity .
It enabled us to build efficient businesses .
So , what do you think so much like that is ? It 's a lot of heart and in a corporate context .
It 's based on our experience .
The first is to create a kind of cultural commitment to creation .
So , how do you get your businesses and your work ?
Or how do you get better customer service ?
The goal of <unk> <unk> is always self - inspirational , and it creates the <unk> of the soil , which makes the heart growth .
This is the first piece .
The second is <unk> .
There are many people in Google .
One of the most famous managers we 've ever said said that he said , " Google is an <unk> community . "
He used to be one of the prisoners .
If you have a <unk> culture and other idealism you allow your <unk> to innovate , they will be the most powerful way to do things .
And the third element is to focus on <unk> and <unk> .
For example , in the Google leaders of Google , it looks like self - <unk> , <unk> compassion and heart compassion , because we believe that leaders start from the beginning .
We even create a liberal course of emotions about emotions , and we often joke that <unk> self - <unk> .
It does n't sound so funny .
And I 'm groomed to become a engineer , but one of the founders of this conference is that I think it 's interesting because Google trust a bridge to teach emotions to emotions .
What companies are .
So what about <unk> self - assembly ?
This is three steps .
And the first step is focused on training .
<unk> is based on all the high skill and emotions .
So anything that has been trained to deliver emotions to emotions , has to be <unk> by attention .
And this idea is to train attention to a mental mind , which is the future of peace and kindness .
This is also a <unk> for emotion .
The second step is over .
The second is that the second line is <unk> and <unk> .
So in the first phase of high - speed disorder , we 've created a <unk> idea associated with cognitive effects and emotions .
What does that mean ?
It means that it can look at our <unk> and emotions , and it 's very clear that we 're going to move through the <unk> .
Once you can do that , you create a <unk> .
In the second phase of <unk> , it 's building new habits .
What does that mean ? Think about you .
Imagine you 're going to meet you from one person at any time , and you 've got one of the first <unk> ideas that you have to do when you want to make it , " I want you to be happier .
I want you to be happier . "
Imagine you can .
There is this kind of habit , and those psychological habits change everything .
Because the good expectations is that unconscious unconscious , it gets a lot of work to trust , and it 's a good relationship to it .
And it works in the workplace .
We want to have a day for <unk> self - assembly , so every one of these industries is at least a <unk> .
And finally , I want to end up with the end of happiness as well .
I want to quote his words -- this guy in <unk> , not other people who say , " If you want people to be happy to get happy .
If you want to be happy , raise your heart . "
And I found that this is true , no matter what it is .
I hope that this pressure is not fun for you , but it 's a benefit .
Thank you .
<unk>
It 's not just about political scientists -- most of the <unk> behavior happening in general , and even in terms of <unk> , <unk> <unk> tells us , we have the ability to stand up and sit down and get to sleep .
global issues , law , politics , prison , war
<unk>
<unk> : How to stop <unk> .
From one of the prisons I met in Cambodia met a 12 year - old boy who was rejected and blocking the lawyer .
When I look at his eyes , I realized that even though I was written by the police of the political press , and I would n't write him a person because 12 years old , the 12 year - old kids did n't make a difference .
He 's not political .
And he was 12 years old , because he had just won a bicycle .
And I realized that not only in Australia , but in the statistical developing countries of the <unk> countries , it 's been proven by the law that they 're ready to fund lawyers , and they do n't have a good job .
And I think we have a wonderful opportunity to bring the whole global community together .
We often look at political behavior , or perhaps the worst effects of the world , but in fact , <unk> is not going to depend on political <unk> .
But people who live in the law of life are not the lowest - cost <unk> , which is the cost of a cost - to - sacrifice ratio -- it 's much cheaper than the lawyer and the search for a lot of time , and most of the time is that the lawyers do n't have to be cheaper .
And I believe that if we unite the whole international society , we make an option to stop the <unk> , but there are three ways for three points .
First of all , to give the world a laws of health , health care , enough training , help and help .
And the second is that <unk> is the beginning of <unk> , and that 's where it is .
It 's a commitment to commitment and commitment .
In 2000 , I started thinking about what if we really did that .
Can we do something about this year ?
And so I started a institution called " International <unk> , " which is a very special task , and it 's stopping the laws of the legal system , where we have a group of training lawyers in the middle of this era to <unk> the police , to the <unk> .
And my first experience came from Cambodia , and I remember that the first time in 1994 , the entire country had only 10 lawyer , because the Khmer Rouge had almost <unk> them .
And even 20 years later , there 's only 10 lawyers in the country , so when you go into a prison , you 're not going to get 12 years old , and you say , " Why are you being dumped ? " And women would say " I 've been dumped , because my husband 's <unk> ca n't get him . "
So there was no law in the West .
And the first thing is , I remember when I was training for them , and I said , " Well , how do you do that ? "
In the 1970s , finally , a woman stands up to her , and she said , " <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
And she said , " I 've got to make a <unk> for <unk> , but I never had to do it for them , because they 're going to work . "
And then we talked about some of the facts : First , they 're not going to depend on information , but second : we do n't want to encourage handouts , especially right now .
And these lawyers need a lot of compassion to decide that they 're going to stand up and help to make sure that the law is not <unk> .
And I remember the first one who was 25 people in the world , and the women sat down behind her , on her side to her -- and he said , " No no no , we 're going to do something about it . "
But one day there was a perfect job of a <unk> woman who sat across a house and she sat outside a house .
She said that there was a guy running out , she thought she was n't a good thing , but the police came , and police had to come and grab her .
At the time , she was pregnant . She had a lot of resistance . And unfortunately she did .
And when her case , the judges stood up to the vendor , and he said , " Well , except there 's no evidence of how many evidence you 're going to release . "
And so our lawyers started to do these things and then they started <unk> the history of Australia .
But it 's not just Australia .
And I thought , was it just Australia ?
Or do other countries like this ?
There are many countries .
And in <unk> I went into a prison , not a 12 year - old boy , but a eight - year boy because lettuces were arrested .
Or a woman ; I 've got her kids , really cute , and I said , " You 're a kid . "
That 's not a baby , she 's three years old .
The mother told me , " Yeah , that 's because she 's just coming out of the way " because the mother fought two two sheets of paper and a leopard , and it 's still a <unk> .
I found my prison administrators , and I said , " You 're going to go out .
<unk> will release her . "
And he said , " Okay , we can do it , but look at this prison , that 's 80 percent of the people who have no lawyer . What do we do ? "
And so our lawyers are starting to stand up and get a system that goes back and forth .
But what we found was that not only the quality of lawyers training more than the lawyers of their relationships .
And for example , in Australia , people do n't wear <unk> <unk> , but they have 24 lawyers and help him , and they 're telling me , " We 're working together as a desert . "
And in <unk> , I remember <unk> from one of the guards , and everybody said , " I 'm here for a year , or eight or 19 years -- and there 's no lawyer ; " -- I 've heard that people say that there are so many of these things that we say , you know , we 've told people that they 're going to do a lot of <unk> and complain about it , because we 're not listening to it . "
And he said , " But I want you to understand that lack of resources never remained <unk> . "
And with this belief that he managed to organize the <unk> lawyer , and those people were constantly doing this .
And we found that the key to participating and give people the opportunity to <unk> lawyers .
And I 've been touched recently in Egypt recently and another group of lawyers , and they tell me , " Look , our streets are n't working on the fact that this revolution is the foundation of the revolution , which is that the police are <unk> , so they 're doing it . "
And I said , " Well , you 've got a hundred million dollars already used for <unk> laws .
What happened ? "
And I went up to a law where they were groomed and judges , and this is what they normally do .
And they showed me a little bit of a <unk> .
I said , " I want to be <unk> . "
There 's all these rules : lawyers are allowed to go to police . Excellent .
It 's going to be a trained training .
And I said to them , " I 've got a question to ask you , what do they do when they go to the office ? "
And after doing something , they said , " They have to eat a little bit . "
So the answer to the question is not just about the lawyer , and it 's about finding ways to connect with the lawyers , because they 're the system of <unk> , because they 're <unk> <unk> .
And I said to you , I know that sounds like : " Oh , good . Can you be able to solve the problem ? Is that true ? "
They feel bad .
But I have a lot of reasons to believe it can happen .
The first reason is that people do it in the ice , and they 're trying to create magic , because their faith and responsibility .
It 's not just what I tell you about the <unk> , but a lot of <unk> from the world to search for answers .
We have a project called <unk> <unk> , and we found a lot of people who have courage , but how do we support them ?
So there 's a competition in the Internet : <unk> is 5,000 dollars , if you want a creative approach .
We have 30 " <unk> " from the world , for example , <unk> , Congo , and they made a stunning contribution by 5,000 dollars by the <unk> services , using <unk> training through all sorts of ways .
And it 's not just about these <unk> , and we see people who are brave enough to use their relationships .
So for example , in China , there 's this kind of legislation that says police ca n't <unk> , otherwise they 're going to be <unk> .
And I sat down in a very violent lawyer , and I said , " What do we do ? How do you ensure that these laws are governed ?
They 're really good . " He said to me , " Are you rich ? " And he said , ' No , we can still think about it . We can think about it . "
At the 4 4 , he organized 3,000 of the best <unk> came from 14 China , and they built themselves to the police of these laws , where he started to think about a violent law for <unk> , to protect the law .
So I talked about what we need to train and support .
And we need to be able to ensure that we 're going to <unk> the lawyer immediately .
And the third thing is that we insist on this business .
And people always say , " You know , this is really good , just amazing .
Maybe not . "
And I think that this is interesting , it 's fun because it is told that billions of people are decided to eradicate slavery , or terrorists .
Each one of them starts with a group of people who decided they decided they could stay .
There 's one of the most favorite signs of our lawyer , and they are exchanging each other , " Keep the <unk> " to the gods , even though they 're not alone , but you do n't fall alone . "
I believe that if we can unite the name of international society , not only lawyers , but all of the laws in the law , we 're going to stop that <unk> .
I know people have a problem , and I 'm really happy to give you a lot of money -- I knew people would ask , " What can I do ? "
I 'm going to tell you , first , you know what you can do . First of all , I want to talk to you about the story of the word " International of <unk> , " and he 's inspired by the word " organization . "
And I met <unk> , and he was four Lincoln in a Indo - Packard prison , because he had died in prison because everybody liked his prison parents , so he 's only the only one who allowed to travel from the booms .
And as you know , there 's a lot of rock <unk> that grew up there , and his head is big .
So when he fell to the first parachute , second , third anesthesia , and then she moved through his head , he could go back and come back into the third and the second one , then he grabbed me in the next day and he 'd like to leave my mailbox .
And even though he did n't come to visit every single day , he really wanted to see all the <unk> prisoners , and I 'd like to lock him up and put his thumb into that little <unk> .
And sometimes it 's a place where a <unk> is <unk> , and he 's <unk> the <unk> .
And most of the Iraq says he 's their biggest happiness , they expect to meet him . I think it 's four kids .
There was no <unk> in prison , but he had an extension of his hero , and I was convinced that we were born . He said , " Maybe I ca n't do anything .
But the force is a force .
I can do it . "
So I 'm grateful for us to have a better world with us .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> is the exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York , and she wants to spread into her understanding of design .
art , arts , culture , design , <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : Design is art
The people who are <unk> , the <unk> of heaven .
It 's a heaven that is a heaven and a <unk> .
I used to look at the <unk> of <unk> , and I could use my tummy pressure , like I was a boy watching television , just like my elbow on my leg .
And I can just look at where I 'm going to show you , I can look at the film .
Sometimes you have this <unk> feeling , like when you 're reading the subway in New York , you feel that <unk> air is <unk> .
And what 's interesting is that , from some way , I have this kind of paradise , because I found it -- I found it .
And of course , Bosch took me to understand it , and when I was 24 years old , I found out that I 'm going to feel better than the people who are doing it .
In life , I was basically in the state of <unk> , and everything I saw was just a long story .
For example , in 2004 , the exhibition was called " <unk> Design . "
At the time we were in the closet . We built a big , big building , so we 're in a very small , tiny , tiny , small <unk> .
That 's one of my most interesting moments in my career .
But it 's not .
This <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of life , which is about 50 anniversary of the anniversary .
So I started thinking , " <unk> <unk> and all sorts of Swiss designers try to get rid of the <unk> , design a new <unk> .
Of course , you can imagine " <unk> Design " exhibition , which is the same thing .
And at the same time , I really want to , the real purpose of this exhibition is in you .
The exhibition is dealing with a way to think about what they think they do .
When they 're in the middle of the house .
And I 'd love them to go into the kitchen to look at a <unk> , or their mother , to do a museum , instead of doing a museum , not for two arrows .
So everybody 's been trying to make the new " <unk> design " exhibition . In <unk> , we put a lot of books in that , just for people to see what they 're seeing .
And when you do this , normally you get 80 percent of the advice that you have , and only 20 percent is true , but almost all the opinions are good advice .
And the <unk> was at that point .
So , for example , I did n't know that <unk> was invented , but they were very proud of it , so every <unk> said , " Please , " <unk> <unk> .
But what I want to show you is that it comes from very good advice : They 're <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Moving on , I just came up with this idea of <unk> -- this is the transportation cord , and we called it <unk> , which is <unk> .
Now , let 's think about your own <unk> . You can send them to us , as you 'll welcome .
But this exhibition asked me to know more about a question , and since I went into the Museum of Modern Art , I started thinking about it .
I 'm <unk> . In Italy , it 's everywhere .
You know , people in different places are fundamentally different .
While I was in Argentina and in Indonesia , in these countries , there was a very nice tradition of modern art , which is the other place where the art does n't see anything else .
In Italy -- especially in the art of the <unk> Art , it did n't have a lot of seat .
But design -- my God !
You do n't have to go to the Grand Canyon , and you 're going to find a lot of cool designs that everybody thinks that we are so <unk> .
That 's just what you find in the store .
New York is another alternative to contemporary art .
I 've always been surprised by this , three years old , knowing who Richard <unk> is , and you will also stop the art .
But design , because there 's still only a <unk> of <unk> .
This is really interesting . When I mentioned " Design , " a lot of people think that this is a <unk> design -- in this case , it 's an intentional design , but it 's <unk> , it 's the <unk> .
They 're thinking about someone who is chosen .
These are part of design , of course , but more design .
But it could also be a design school in Jerusalem to find a better way to design it , because , you know , Israel has a baby .
So , what 's going on here is that the design of these design is to find a way to reduce the <unk> , like teenagers can continue to <unk> <unk> , rather than <unk> .
And the people who design these babies are <unk> because babies can be supported by their parents , because the body is so important .
And they can do a little tent .
No matter how many <unk> you think there are <unk> and <unk> , which is a very nice design , although this is the design of <unk> furniture .
And what I 've been trying to do is try to use the use of <unk> , because it 's really great to work in there because you 're really capable of doing it , and that ability can make people know that you have the exhibition or to watch a museum , or a design museum .
I know 80 percent of them are going to look at the Picasso and the <unk> , and if they come to us , I 'm trying to get them out there .
But what I 've been trying to do is to try and do something that 's been built in the museum of the Museum of museum in <unk> , and it 's the attempt to figure out what 's going on on the world .
There 's a lot of examples . In fact , <unk> <unk> might now sit in front of the audience , but from his great , older , granddad 's greatest example , and then Charles and <unk> have been <unk> by the first <unk> of <unk> -- and the second one is about two players , which is the founder of a <unk> furniture .
And there was a really good design for that time .
There 's a lot of projects about design and design that make life better .
So , I started doing this since 95 ' ' 90s , " which is called " innovation <unk> " exhibition .
This is a new stage , and I think , in the city , materials can be designed by design .
And this also led me to different sorts of design examples , like <unk> <unk> in California , where these products started pouring into market .
And at the same time , the <unk> of <unk> , and he made these beautiful <unk> and pepper pepper bottles .
So , you see , these design clusters are very <unk> .
Another example of the other , in August of 2001 , I asked different kinds of design in the world , and then I 'm going to talk about a new style of work .
What you see here is IDEO design .
<unk> , it 's called " <unk> sky . "
And this idea is to assumed that if you have a little <unk> , you can go on a sky on your head , and you 've got your own " <unk> <unk> " in <unk> . This is a very famous painter .
And the other thing , Carl <unk> , is looking at what 's going on to work at work , and it 's the best of the design that I want to work in .
And that leads me to a very important idea about design , where design is the largest synthetic family in the world .
And what they do is they 're going to think about human needs , and in terms of the economic and sustainability issues , they end up doing a problem .
And <unk> <unk> is a very interesting thing to do , and it 's very interesting .
And the idea that she works -- you know , when everybody says , " You really need to make a job . "
Instead , she 's saying , " No , no job of work and altruism . "
Really , <unk> , that 's like the <unk> television show in 2001 .
There 's a lot of other exhibition , but I do n't want to just focus on my show .
Instead , I want to talk about some great design <unk> .
I 've always been fascinated by this word of <unk> .
You know , 13 years ago , I came to the United States , and I was still saying , well , what does that mean ?
So today , I was sleeping on the morning and told me that there was no smile in his cattle .
So he did n't have any other person . So , he was a <unk> .
And so the design of design really needs to become a <unk> , because design is the best way to do things that we lose before , and that 's when it 's never existed or believes that there 's a new behavior .
So , " Safety is the last exhibition I did in <unk> , and it ended up last year .
This exhibition is the design of safety and protecting .
And so it 's been launched in 2001 , and it was called " <unk> . "
And after 9/11 happened , I did n't have to go to the exhibition , and then I went back to it , until it came back and back , like <unk> <unk> , which was about <unk> and safety .
This exhibition is <unk> from the whole <unk> device to the water , so it 's a very widespread exhibition .
And it also has the same thing , and you know , I 'm working with Lewis . You 've seen something in his website .
What 's interesting is that we do n't need to talk about design and art . But design is the tool that can use it to make a point .
This is a kind of an economic consciousness , a sense of humor .
This is a very beautiful design from South Africa .
This is a restaurant for fairness / <unk> .
And the idea of design is that when you 're involved in <unk> and <unk> , the police are approaching you , and you are wearing the coat . It looks like a big heart , it 's <unk> in the position of your heart .
And you can imagine , when a group of people are wearing the same coat , collective <unk> will kick police .
You know , design <unk> sometimes do n't make a difference , but they 're very useful about what we 're doing .
<unk> and <unk> are designed to design a series of things that can reflect our pain and emotion , like this kind of <unk> furniture , so it can be made out of the way that you 're going to do it , and it 's able to <unk> it . And it allows you to hide it in the United States , but it is a <unk> that allows us to avoid the <unk> <unk> , which is that it does n't happen .
But the interesting thing about the exhibition is that it turns out that the <unk> <unk> is your self - <unk> . There are some designs starting to work in this particular area .
This is from the design of the Netherlands , <unk> <unk> , a series of <unk> women designed for the Muslim woman .
You can make them ski , they do whatever they want to do , and do n't worry about themselves .
And when you do this , you 've got a chance to find a great job of design .
<unk> is very young , and I guess he might be 27 years old . By working with psychologists , he made a series of toys for the <unk> of a toy .
These tools are really great .
It 's like , you know , it 's going to be <unk> , and you have the lonely ones who prefer to embrace , so that the toy has springs and mirrors to see themselves from mirrors .
Design is actually from different realms .
I came up with a conference on Turkey , and this is from " International <unk> . "
And what 's interesting is that I 'm the last <unk> , and there 's a lot of people who are really talking about luxury disease . I do n't want to be a member of a party , but I 've got to feel the talk back .
The truth is that the luxury of luxury is there 's a lot of <unk> , which is a lot of luxury people .
And for that , I 'll give you two examples .
This is in the aftermath of the Cuban , and this is a <unk> <unk> toy toy . And that 's what it is doing .
They 're beautiful , but their beautiful beauty from their design is that they 're very <unk> .
And what you 're seeing here is two brothers from Sao Paulo and <unk> seals , and they 're inspired by the poverty and wisdom and the wisdom of the poor and then the <unk> of the <unk> .
And that 's exactly the incredible thing about the market .
Seriously , design <unk> . What 's interesting about the progress of technology , when we become more sophisticated and <unk> , designed us to do something .
Sometimes , designers will let you take a baby .
And you see , this piece of furniture needs you to use .
Even this chair , you need to open up and sit on top of it , so it leaves you . This is a series of things that are designed by <unk> <unk> .
His work is made from <unk> 's hair to chocolate , and you go to the <unk> of your love to <unk> your toes on your toes .
These are really beautiful , because it 's a glamorous moment .
A few years ago , I heard a mathematician named <unk> <unk> , who explains the innovation of military manufacturing , and that innovation is like two opposite <unk> .
That 's the reason .
In the ' 80s , <unk> in the war , but in <unk> societies like <unk> , you have to have no glasses .
And when peace came up , all of these technologies were going to be used by <unk> markets .
Many of you have heard of Charles and <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> chair , which is one of the examples .
And I think this is a strange moment .
There 's a huge amount of change happening in the last 25 years , like ours , and so I stopped thinking about how much it is .
But this is really a very important moment of design , but it 's not only about openness to open resources into the media , and there 's also the sustainability of CO2 and development , which is also a part of how much design works .
And this is why design is more powerful and focused on the behaviors of design , rather than item .
And especially the great design of design is not saying that all of the design are so .
I want you to look at it , <unk> , very rare .
He 's another design of a young man from France , and now he 's working with military firms , design new ways that people are especially kids , especially kids who are very young .
So for example , this is a beautiful bottle of <unk> that you 're going to do when you want to take your drug , and it 's <unk> <unk> .
And the other thing that 's going to be able to show you is that you 're happy to engage in this particular process that you 're doing .
So , in similar , there 's a lot of design objects that try to engage you , and make all sorts of things come from your mouth , so you can make fun of mistakes .
The next demonstration I 'm going to do is to show you the relationship between design and science , and I 've been talking about this .
And I 'm trying to find out not about the metaphor , but it 's the common problem , the status quo , and I think this is the way that we 're going to go through the design of design , which is a way to create a kind of interpretation .
And I hope that all of you can do it .
Some of you sent me a email .
We can see the <unk> in different directions , and it 's going to start with a very small job of working , which is that it can make a great and meaningful thing .
Thank you .

I have to say that I think <unk> trying to <unk> a lot of the unconscious , because I 'm going to tell you a little bit about the subject .
But I want to try something different , trying to figure out what 's going on next to my personal story .
All right , Africa is a complex continent , and you can see what you see .
But not only that .
You know , this is surprising .
I mean , we need the whole generation of time to talk about this continent .
Imagine that .
This is exactly what we say : the focus of the media is always focused on negative news .
So why is this a problem ?
One of the classic stories of <unk> diseases is poor .
Some of you might say , well , <unk> , you 've graduated in Harvard , and all of a lucky person who says , forget about the poorest people .
Let 's focus on commercial and markets , or anything that 's all made , and there are thousands of Africans who are already helping who really need help .
So what I want to talk about is my story .
That 's the story of many African Africans .
So , let 's start with the poor .
I 'm not growing up in <unk> or <unk> , but I do n't know how to survive or you have to raise your house .
And <unk> said to me .
If you look at this home , you can see that they can get their hands .
Well , we have chicken <unk> .
And we had <unk> .
Like a lot of African families , my parents never have to pay attention because they 're going to help brothers and sisters , and their parents do n't know that way .
When I was born , they realized that they had a beautiful smart kids who did n't want me to go to their mouth .
They set up a very interesting way , and they 're going to read a school where they can get paid .
And so they took me to a <unk> school school , and I was doing my career .
What happened next is that , because they sometimes have a lot of time , sometimes I 've got a number of times when I 'm in the age of every semester at the top of the semester , and it 's a lot of times when I 'm in the middle of the semester at the age of every semester 's birthday , so I 've got a couple of years of return to school when they 're not born at school , in every single semester , at a moment of a semester who 's been dumped .
And you know , someone took that piece of work into the <unk> , and the people who were n't able to say , when the parents were poor , you could barely get married until it was in school .
I 've always been thinking about why they 're going to read a cheap school .
You know , kids are very awkward and very sensitive to each other , when you do n't have money .
But my parents kept doing this , and I did n't understand what they did .
Talk about corruption .
We have a high school in Kenya in Kenya .
The best universities are the best schools .
I dreamed of the school at the high school schools in Kenya .
I was less than less .
And I was very upset about what I did .
And my dad said , okay , okay .
Just try to talk to <unk> .
<unk> , and if there 's a gap , maybe she 's going to let you go out .
So we went to school because we were just <unk> , because because of our dad , my dad showed that our identity was <unk> .
I sat down , and I heard that little guy who said you think you 're .
If you think you can get that flow , it 's fun .
And if I have to meet with those who have been very bad , they have a terrible car .
The worst sin ever seen in front of his dad is <unk> .
And then we left , and I swear to my life , I 'd never say anything about it .
Two weeks later , in school , I went to university , and they said to me , you can go . It 's been rejected .
Last story .
It 's about disease .
His dad owned HIV in 1999 .
And he never told him that he had HIV / AIDS , and he was afraid of <unk> <unk> .
And that 's what I 'm trying to do .
And when I was in the United States , they called him sick , and it was his first disease .
He had to have <unk> <unk> .
So I looked at the song and I looked at the <unk> .
Because the <unk> doctors could n't tell us what happened .
They 're like , you know , it 's a long thing .
When I went to the Internet , I realized that I did n't think about it .
For the first time , he <unk> .
But he needed to keep healing at the United States , in the U.S. , for <unk> mushrooms , to sell 30 dollars .
And he <unk> on that pill .
You know , money <unk> .
His disease is <unk> .
And in that time , he had a friend of his friends in India , and he could get a <unk> for his dad .
And that makes the dad alive .
But the money was quickly .
His head is <unk> , in a football cathedral .
At the time , Kenya had a bank that had <unk> engines , but we did n't have money , and the whole family had no money in the last Monday .
The hospital <unk> my dad for three days .
And finally , we decided we tried to send him to <unk> .
And at least he can get a cure when we try it .
He died , when he was dead he went to the hospital .
Okay , imagine , you know what you 're all about .
How do you see me ?
compassion , empathy .
This is what you think of Africa .
This brought me .
And you do n't understand my other side .
You ca n't see the bloggers , you do n't know that I 'm Harvard , a guy who 's at Harvard .
I just want to make a difference .
Because we often use the big idea of Africans , and what do you think ?
But this is <unk> .
And I 'm not only the only one here .
Imagine if you know Rio William grew up in a village .
And you do n't know about the <unk> .
I was just moved .
I was frowning .
And he was like , I did . I succeeded .
I think I should hire him , and he wants to do it . "
That 's exactly what I said .
If you focus on a person who 's unfortunate , we probably miss his potential .
So what do you do ?
First African people , we should be more <unk> .
We 've heard some things yesterday .
This is what we call them .
You know what the blog is .
<unk> is the founder of African expression in South Africa .
So we need to be much better .
If nobody ever told us , we told the story .
This is the <unk> Wikipedia that I want to say .
And <unk> is a country for five million people .
It 's only five .
These four guys are white men , not <unk> .
Another thing is <unk> , if you 're standing here , he 's the deforestation , the first <unk> .
And he 's only the only African African .
People , we ca n't complain about <unk> saying why governments are doing this .
What are we doing ?
What 's the other <unk> guy doing ?
Why do n't we applaud content ?
Just just simply , we need activities .
These are the blogs that are going to be <unk> in Africa now .
This is a <unk> we 've heard about .
They are the Cheetah .
This helps have a flaws .
The eight - year - old <unk> later , we do n't have more attention .
Yeah , you do n't have it .
But I think it 's not enough to advertise it .
How do you struggle with people who are traveling in the East , and I 'm going to do something about it ?
Okay .
Africa needs you .
And it 's not enough to make it happen .
I 'm from one of the best companies in <unk> , <unk> lawyers .
Two months or three months in the last two months , there 's a lot of money to deal with the problems of my family .
But I was <unk> because my passion was here because I wanted to be inspired .
Because here it is .
<unk> <unk> titles in Harvard 's titles , and I 'm very likely to be able to make all kinds of rewards .
And one of the reasons is that I 'm going to work with me .
But here 's the need .
Most of my time in <unk> , I 've spent a lot of <unk> lawyers in South Africa .
We 're going to live in Africa now .
We provide businesses to public services and <unk> <unk> .
I 've created a project in Kenya , and what we 're doing is to record the role of Kenya .
My <unk> <unk> , the high - tech expert , creates <unk> blog platforms .
This month paid me 20 dollars per year .
The rest of the other <unk> were made of love .
We 're almost only typing all kinds of data .
You can find all the questions that the <unk> are asking in Congress .
The website has a false function , and people can ask the question .
Some of them will be involved in this project , they answer questions .
We built this project because we were tired of love our politicians .
I think responsibility comes from demand .
You do n't just have a good job .
We need a challenge to challenge our leaders .
What are they doing ?
They do n't change anything .
So we need new policy , and where can we come from ?
Another thing is that leaders are our social reflection .
We talk about Africa as they fall from Mars .
And indeed , they come from our pond .
What if the leaders we do n't like ?
How do we change ?
So <unk> is a way of thinking about the way that we can try and refine them .
What do we do ?
I believe <unk> forces .
I believe that the power of sharing knowledge .
I want to leave you with all the things that you 're going to be able to share with you , because it 's important that this relationship is important .
Another thing that I want to encourage you to do is to keep self - interest .
I talked a lot about Africa .
People are like , well , if you do n't help me , what can I do ?
When I talk about my thoughts , they 're <unk> .
So for me , I can do that .
This is not easy .
Sometimes you meet colleagues or <unk> , it 's sometimes important , especially in Africa , because there 's a lot of help behind Africa .
In fact , when I was at the law school , my mother 's business moved , so I hired her .
And my sister struggle with me .
And I helped her get her .
She was really clever . She really was smart .
And I went to her .
One of my mentors died in AIDS , and his kids become <unk> .
She 's becoming my kid now .
Because for me , I can help them .
So do n't underestimate that .
For example , a man changed my life .
He 's a professor , and he 's working on <unk> .
<unk> - Cohen , <unk> , <unk> .
Because , I could get married Harvard , because he concentrated attention .
And I went through his <unk> , and he found that I was so passionate that this was n't uncommon in the United States .
And he 's called to go to his office and ask me what you want to do .
And I said I 'd like to be a lawyer .
He asked why America did n't lose lawyers .
<unk> invites me to give me the idea , but it 's like , well , I do n't know how to do that , and I 'm a founder of political science .
So let 's find out what you need to do , what I need .
Why do you go there ?
For me , that was in college , and I read a little bit about a university in the university , like <unk> and Kenya .
So I was inspired by <unk> .
And he asked why , he said you 're smart , you have enough conditions .
I 'm here because here 's cheap and I love <unk> .
This may be the most glamorous reason I 've ever heard <unk> <unk> .
And he helped me .
And he said , I can go to Harvard and say I 'm okay .
If she did n't give me , they were wrong .
And it was he helped me .
This is a very good example .
You have some important people here .
We need a force .
I need to go into the next stage .
Basically , I 'm going to talk about the end of my vision for Africa .
A gentleman told us that we had to leave Africa to get to the future of our own future .
My vision is that my daughter and other children are born to be what they want to do .
They do n't have the circumstances they 're born .
This is what American people think .
It 's not very good for the environment , but you can also <unk> .
Just because of the <unk> village , it wo n't affect you what you can become .
For most of the African people today , you 've got to be born , or whatever you 're born in .
And I want to see this change and these changes from us .
As Africans , we need to be responsible for our Africa .
Thank you .
<unk>
<unk> is one of the important things that death in death -- but it can stop -- because , but traditional search devices are slow and slower and inspiring , and in this <unk> , TED Fellow <unk> describes how his group and his team have developed a simple <unk> of blood pressure , which is <unk> by the <unk> blood vessel .
chemistry , medicine , poverty , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : There 's no blood test .
I like to build things .
I always love it .
My team in <unk> -- this is a company I 'm working with with my doctors and engineers -- to make a new technology called <unk> , which can help <unk> blood vessel , and it does n't require <unk> .
I believe that this will be <unk> .
It sounds like a cow , and I do n't know .
In fact , in 2009 , it 's more than today .
I do n't know what will happen next .
And I was trying to try to figure out how to do it , and I 've studied a lot of money in the blood pressure , which I studied by Wikipedia , how they 're going to make a system like this -- and how it works .
I was building a project called " King Spring , " and I was in MIT called the <unk> Cities Lab , which created this beautiful motorcycle bike .
I 'm very pleased to go back at a vacation trip when I was in Mumbai .
So I was thinking about a road traveling .
And I went to one of these two hours in the West , and I called the <unk> city .
My friend seals , <unk> , was working here .
He 's a doctor .
This is a picture of his <unk> .
I was waiting for a moment in Australia .
Because he was in a place where he came in .
And so I 'd like to wait when he finally came up with him .
And he told me that the two <unk> of mother had died and children died .
And because it 's -- he tells me -- a situation called <unk> <unk> .
And he says that this is actually a serious <unk> .
And what I 'm really surprised about this is that what he mentioned is completely <unk> .
This is now -- it 's a engineers , I know -- completely <unk> disease .
It 's known to <unk> .
For example , like <unk> , or <unk> <unk> -- these cheap <unk> are completely controlled .
So why do women die ?
This is completely <unk> .
And there 's a <unk> center from the back of the five minutes , and there is a medical center in the center of <unk> <unk> .
And this is totally <unk> .
I think there are ways to stop <unk> .
My mother is a <unk> doctor .
She told me that she was so <unk> .
And then I took blood pressure to the blood bear , and I tried to figure out the blood .
This is a value machine for a million dollars in Mumbai .
And I think that in most of the regions of Europe and Europe .
But he did n't have that device .
And what I do is they do this stuff , and I mean , I 'm not talking about <unk> .
And this really bothers me -- I like to do all sorts of problems . I want to make this stuff .
One of my engineers , <unk> , Henry Bush , joined this team -- and he wanted to solve this problem .
From now to me , I 'm going to leave you with a lot of people because this is completely <unk> of their lives .
Let 's go back to <unk> .
You see this woman here , she 's a nurse .
In India they called them <unk> .
And every village need this one <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
She 's the center of <unk> systems .
The public <unk> is based on <unk> , not by doctors .
We know we 're going to design one thing .
We know something about this stuff .
We know that it does n't have to be <unk> or <unk> , and it 's going to make the medical clothing and things like that .
It 's enough to be simple , easily , to do it .
And third is <unk> , this nurse can put it into the <unk> .
Because she 's going to wrestle with some of the villages .
We think we should be able to draw this thing and then we draw it .
But it does n't make any difference .
And then we built another one .
We built 32 million units .
But I 'm very excited to tell you that last year we 've done -- well , good use .
I 'm in the <unk> .
This little device is called <unk> <unk> .
And what it does is it <unk> my blood vessel , which is the <unk> and the oxygen .
And I put it in the <unk> , and I waited for about 20 seconds , so it 's going to show my <unk> in this little sphere .
And this will help the <unk> of the <unk> .
So let me explain to you how it works .
And you might have seen this .
In fact , there are three <unk> of light , three different <unk> of light .
We actually take these light into our bodies , and then the amount of light that we 're going to use is the ratio of <unk> , which we can then have a vessel of blood pressure .
And this result is based on a technology that 's called <unk> change .
In fact , we 're really interested in using the tools of the future , and it 's also very interest in the future of the future .
One of the things that happened to these technologies is that , by one of my <unk> , mobile phones , the <unk> used to <unk> this data .
We 're still doing lots of fun .
I do n't want to talk about that .
But the map of that is that I have this map called " <unk> <unk> . "
That 's the death of the world in the world .
You 'll notice that these are high - death deaths -- like Asia and Africa .
My business plan is easy .
I want to sell every medical clinic in the world .
This is certainly the <unk> of my plan .
When I did this goal in 2020 , when the World Health Organization was released , this map would become a new brain distribution .
Thank you .
<unk>
<unk> is a <unk> epidemic , a lot of <unk> behavior behind the <unk> of vulnerability , <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> Brown tries to understand what happens when people relate to <unk> .
brain , culture , psychology , self
<unk>
Yves Brown : Forget <unk> .
I 'm going to tell you a little bit about my <unk> .
And at the end of the day , I had the worst <unk> <unk> of my life in my life .
And I 've got three days .
The first time you came to see a friend with a friend .
When I arrived , she was in the outside .
And then I sat down , and she said , " Oh , my God , you 've misunderstood . "
And I said , " Thank you , I do n't think it 's normal . "
And she said , " What ? "
And I said , " I 've just told 500 people , say I became an <unk> researcher .
And when my data turns out to keep the fragility of life , I told this 500 people that I <unk> <unk> .
There was no slide to write .
So what did I think that was a good idea ? "
And she said , " I 've seen the rest of you .
<unk> : <unk> .
It 's different from you .
It 's really great . "
And I said , I have to stop this .
And YouTube , they have to put it on YouTube .
That 's 600 people , 700 people .
And she said , " Well , I 'll see that . "
So I said , " Please ask you . "
She said , " Okay . "
And then I said , " You know , remember when you 're a kid who 's particularly crazy at college ? "
And she said , " Hey , remember . "
And I said , " But remember we have a particularly bad experience for <unk> .
And then we have to get rid of his face , and then what does this <unk> ? "
And she said , " Hey , . Never remember .
So , of course , I could n't say , " Oh , that 's okay .
So what did I do ?
And I said , " Hey , what do you do ? What are you doing ?
How do you say that ? Are you missing ?
Your sisters are perfect . "
And so she looked at me , and she said , " You do n't think it 's going to go inside them to YouTube ? "
I said , " I 'm going to make a little step . "
And she said , " Well , you 're the most <unk> model of the past . "
And then I looked at her , and she said a little bit about a bit of a dramatic , more <unk> .
And I said , if 500 becomes 1,000 or 2,000 .
I was born in my life , and I had the same thing .
So my life turned out .
And the most difficult thing is , I found that part of myself is that the one thing that I 'm going to do is I ca n't tell my work to the public and the other , and I do n't have a lot of work in the background , but it 's very difficult to look at it .
But I want to talk about that .
I learned two things about the last year .
First of all , fragile is n't the <unk> .
And this false understanding is very dangerous .
And I want to ask you guys -- give you a <unk> , as a professional professional , and I know that you 're going to feel a little bit like -- so how many of you are in your hands -- and how much of it is , when you think about it , how are you <unk> ?
How many people think that <unk> and <unk> are a thing ?
Most people .
Now we 're going to ask you , how many people in the TED conference , when you see it here , I think that 's pure courage ?
It 's not <unk> .
And I define it as a risk of emotion , emotional risk , <unk> , and physics .
It drive our daily lives .
And I 've been doing this kind of faith -- that 's about 12 years of the project -- which is , that vulnerability is the most accurate measure of our courage -- keeps vulnerable , open self , keep self - <unk> .
There 's a strange thing about the TED conference , and then I 've got a lot of invitation around the world -- from school to five strong companies to the world .
A lot of them are like , " Hey , Doc , we love your TED membership .
We want to welcome you to <unk> .
But one thing for you is not to mention vulnerable or <unk> . "
So what would you like to tell me ?
Three main answer .
These are very tough , major developments from commerce , creating and changing and change .
So let me show you this : vulnerability is <unk> , creating and changing and change .
The creation is to make something unseen .
No more vulnerable .
<unk> change is all about <unk> .
And the second thing that 's happening in completely understanding is that the relationship between <unk> and courage , I learned , has to talk about <unk> .
I 'm going to thank you very much for you .
When I became a <unk> researcher , because the TED speaker becomes focus -- I 'm not kidding .
I 'll give you a quick example .
About three months ago , when I was in a sports campaign , these parents bought the same thing as a child .
From about 100 feet , I hear , " vulnerable TED ! <unk> ! "
I 'm <unk> .
Our family <unk> : " <unk> <unk> , Keep fighting fighting . "
I 'm not born to study vulnerability .
So I was like , I 've been walking , and she 's over six times .
And then I heard , " <unk> TED ! "
And I said , " Hey , hey . "
She 's here , and she said , " You 're the <unk> researcher . "
And the parents were doing their kids on their kids .
" Look . "
This time I did n't have it , I looked at her , and she said , " I 'm here , that 's a soul . "
And she looked at me , and she said , " Know <unk> . "
And she said , " Well , we 're reading your TED <unk> .
And then you read your book , and then we called it " <unk> <unk> " and she said , " Well , our point is : " We 're <unk> and it 's great . "
So when I became vulnerable , like a toy <unk> , it was just called <unk> TED , and I thought , I 'm going to take it for six years , because I 've had six months to talk about vulnerability and writing about <unk> .
I thought , <unk> , because <unk> is a terrible topic , nobody wants to talk about it .
It 's the best way to get the airplane out of the wing .
" What do you do ? " " I study <unk> . "
And I 'm telling you .
But in the last year , I was struck by a fundamental law that reminds me -- not doing research , but based on a moral drive , you could only have a good <unk> -- you have a good <unk> .
And I do n't have a study of vulnerability to courage , creation , innovation and innovation .
And I learned to learn from <unk> .
So I 'd like to bring you into the <unk> .
Jung do n't think that the most ancient <unk> is called the soul of the soul .
And we 're going to zoom in .
The purpose is not to go into the house to survive .
It 's on the top of the <unk> , and it 's going to be able to get out of the way .
And this is because of that .
We 've heard the most important question to be in this country , and I think it 's all around the world , right ?
Right ? We heard about it .
Right ?
I do n't want to talk about that , because there 's no conversation because of talking about race .
When people talk about music , they 're submerged .
We 've heard a simple way to reduce the deaths of patients in the patients that are preparation for one thing .
It does n't make any sense , because when they teach people how they <unk> their self - esteem , they also taught them how to be <unk> .
And people who do n't need the first list of lists .
And here I have to write the name of the TED conference , and I have to write this TED Prize .
Yves <unk> wants me to cry for me .
And here 's the first day I met at TED .
And he stood up to explain what he was creating a little bit of a <unk> technique to prevent the patient without dying .
And he said , " I 've seen this .
And guess what ? I did a word . "
And the whole thing happened , " That 's cool . "
And he goes , " But it does n't work . "
And then I tried 32 speed , and I did it . "
Do you know what the biggest secret is ?
I do n't want to tell you .
So here I am .
It 's like an <unk> meeting .
No , it 's .
Why is this magic ?
Because nobody is afraid of fear .
And nobody in this stage does n't have any , I know , <unk> failed .
I used to have a lot of <unk> .
And I think most people do n't understand it .
<unk> , last year , to help me help a huge <unk> from <unk> Roosevelt .
A lot of people quote it " <unk> . "
It 's like , " <unk> does n't belong .
It 's not the people who sit sitting sitting in front of the real world .
And the <unk> of love came into his head and his face was dust and <unk> and <unk> .
But when he was standing in his head , he could win his life , and he would have failed , but when his failures were injured , she was sick of fear . "
That 's what it is .
It 's about the meaning of life , about death .
And when you go on the door , you put it in front of you , and you say , " I 'm going to go out and do this . "
Not good .
You 've never got a <unk> . You leave you .
I know that your dad is not in the Grand Canyon .
I know what you 're going to do .
I know you know that you 're not beautiful or not enough or too clever , or not enough .
I know even if you 've got your dad , the dad will never care . "
And that 's what it is .
And if we can go and say , " Well , I 'm going to do this " " Let 's take this thing to see these people who laughed in the face , 99 percent of the time ?
It 's us .
And the second thing to play is that these two -- " Never good , if you can step out of this layer , " Who 's your mind ? "
What you need to understand is that <unk> is n't experts .
<unk> focus on itself , <unk> focused on behavior .
<unk> is " I 'm terrible . "
<unk> is " I do terrible things . "
How many of you here , if you do some harm , I 'm going to say , " Sorry , that 's a mistake . "
How many people will say that ?
<unk> : Sorry , I 've got a mistake .
<unk> : Sorry , I 'm a mistake .
There 's a huge difference between <unk> and kindness .
You need to know that .
<unk> is related to this behavior on the bottom , depression , violence , corruption , <unk> , diet .
The more you need to know .
<unk> , <unk> is the opposite .
We 're doing something that we 've done right now , and we 're going to do this as well as possible .
It 's not comfortable , but it can <unk> .
Another thing about <unk> is that it 's completely <unk> of gender .
And when <unk> is <unk> and Chris , it was the same thing .
Everybody knows what it is .
And we can be very sure that the only person who does n't feel that you ca n't make relationships or not .
That means , yeah , I have a little bit of <unk> ; I just did it .
So I thought , well , you have a little <unk> .
<unk> feels like the same thing for men and women , but also for a different approach .
For women , I think the best example of the woman is <unk> , which is the ad , and I can put my laundry on the telephone , <unk> the face , to the <unk> of five to nine .
And I could go home and put it in the <unk> , and I would never forget the dignity of the man . "
For women , <unk> is <unk> , and <unk> never saw you <unk> .
I do n't know how much it is , but I assure you , I have a lot of pepper pills and <unk> pills .
<unk> , for women , is an idea of a <unk> and conflict , conflict of conflict .
It 's a <unk> .
For men , they 're not expecting to vary for each other .
<unk> is the same thing , do n't you ?
<unk> .
I studied with four years of <unk> men .
At the end of a day , a man came to me and said , " I 'm familiar with you , I 'm curious about why you 're not saying men . "
I said , " I do n't study men . "
And he said , " That 's very tough . "
And I said , " Why ? "
And he said , " Because you 're going to go out and get your experience .
But do you see the books that you 've just given my wife and three kids ? "
And I said , " Okay . "
" They 're not looking at me now , and I 'm not going to see the dead that I 'm inundated with .
When we go out and find vulnerable , we 're submerged .
And I 'm going to tell you that this is the marriage of the coach , the men who are doing this , because the women in my life are <unk> for me . "
So I started interviewing men for questions .
And what I learned was that if you could find a woman , she could actually be <unk> with a man who was exposed to <unk> and fear , and then I could show you a fabulous job .
And if you can get me a man , he can be able to get a little bit faster at a bottom line , and then his first response is not : " I 'm going to tell you , " Well , that 's what we need to do -- because that is what the men need .
<unk> is a epidemic in our culture .
And in order to get rid of this dilemma , we need to understand how to do it , and how it impacts the way we educate our kids , work , to look at each other .
It 's very , very fast to share with some of the founders of <unk> .
And he proposed a question : How do you make a standard machine ?
The answer in this country is : Good , very Zen , <unk> and <unk> , and use some resources to <unk> the surface .
And when he asked men , the men in the country need to do something like a standard man , and the answer is that it 's never going to wake up , jobs and violence .
If we want to find each other , we have to know and understand that <unk> , because <unk> is an antidote to <unk> .
If you put <unk> in the <unk> , it needs three things to <unk> : Nothing , no , stupid , and <unk> .
If you put the same amount of <unk> into the <unk> , it 's not going to survive , it ca n't survive .
In the <unk> three , I 'm also <unk> .
So I want to leave you with it .
If we want to find something about each other , it will be the right path to switch .
I know standing outside the <unk> , because I think I 've been doing it all over my lifetime , and I say , I 'm going to fall out of someone 's <unk> and <unk> it .
This is <unk> .
But it never happens .
And even if you 're in perfect perfection , it 's not what you want to see when you go into it .
We hope you 're in .
We want to do it together with you .
We just want , for people who are concerned with us and who we are , who do n't care about us .
Thank you very much . Very good .

A lot of robots can fly -- but no one can do a real bird like a bird , and until <unk> <unk> and his team are working on art , it 's a big , <unk> robot , the size of the <unk> , which is <unk> in <unk> . Look at what 's going on in front of this <unk> - wing .
animals , biomechanics , innovation , design , robots , technology
<unk>
Like the <unk> of the bird .
<unk> is a dream of the birds .
The birds are agile .
They do n't have to be <unk> by skydiving , as long as the wing moves .
So our <unk> , and try to build a model that has to go to the model and have a good air machinery that can be used by the ability to real control .
So what do you have to do with <unk> <unk> ? <unk> , this bird can go through the surface of the ocean , and we do n't choose to model that .
So we built a team .
There 's a lot of <unk> in the area of the air dynamics associated with <unk> <unk> .
Our mission is to build a <unk> model in interior flight , where you can fly your head .
So a few days later .
But it 's a problem : How to <unk> it very easily , if it does n't fall out .
Why do we do that ?
We 're a company of <unk> control , and we 're going to use a very mesh - y structure because it 's more energy , but we also want to understand a lot more .
And now I want you to take your <unk> for good glasses . OK ?
We 're going to try and send you a smart bird .
Thank you .
Now we can get smart birds .
This is a <unk> .
It 's about <unk> .
<unk> is about six or six years old .
It 's all about <unk> materials .
There 's a motor chip on the middle , and we use the gears to get the steering motor .
The motors have three <unk> , and then we know the wing <unk> .
And if you have the wings closed down .
And then we could make it happen like a bird .
And when you look at it , it 's much larger than the size of the <unk> , and the wing is n't very big , so it becomes a bit easier .
So the next thing , or a next challenge , is how to harness this movement .
We have to get rid of it .
We made dust .
And by <unk> the wings , it goes through the top of the house , and the bar goes up to the <unk> .
At the same time , we also know how to <unk> the air force .
We have to be able to calculate the envelope , and then we can calculate the air drive .
So , from the passive constraints of passive forces , its town comes from 30 to 80 percent .
The next thing we want to do is to control the structure of the structure .
It 's only control and <unk> , and it 's going to get the air - driven ratio .
So the whole pile is about to cut 25 square flights per gallon .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : [ <unk> ] <unk> : Yeah , we 'll give you six days .

The <unk> of India in India is given to the same <unk> health care that brought the light out of the <unk> , which is <unk> by innovation , and the cost of innovation can go down very low , but it 's also going to be a little bit more meaningful to think about other changes .

<unk> <unk> : The worst of the world 's quality of <unk>
Good morning .
So let me show you a few experiments that can get people to get rid of suffering .
This is the story of Dr. <unk> <unk> .
His goal and the signals that he <unk> from the <unk> care system .
And what I think is important is that we have to realize what to do .
Woman : When I go to work , everybody says , " Well , what can we do ? "
I ca n't wait . I could n't see my hair .
And if one ant hits me , I ca n't see it .
<unk> <unk> : It does n't look like this , but I think it 's too appealing to have a life , and their dignity , their <unk> , in their families .
She 's just one of thousands of blind people .
The irony is they can avoid blind .
A quick <unk> surgery can be able to get tens of thousands of people , or even simpler , a king , allowing more people to see .
If you look at anyone in the room , because of the <unk> <unk> , they 're going to increase your productivity , and then fifth percent of all the Indians have to look at health care .
Now , we could n't care about 10 percent of them .
So this is the challenge for 30 years of <unk> in <unk> , and this hospital became a <unk> for <unk> .
He <unk> .
He spent his life in his lifetime .
Now , we 've developed about five hospitals in <unk> and <unk> , and then we came up with a place where we called the eye center , so we created the pattern of <unk> .
We 've also been working on other areas of the country in the developing world , and also in other places .
In the first 30 years , we did 35 surgeries , mostly poor people .
Now we 're doing early surgeries every year .
This is a day of <unk> in <unk> , and we 're going to do a lot of surgeries that are about 60 patients , <unk> the patient , to go back to the hospital and take the patients back into a hospital , the most important thing is , most of them are training , so many people in the world are the <unk> of the doctors who are <unk> by doctors .
It 's going to be a lot of work in the day of a day .
And I think it 's going to be done , I 'm grateful for this <unk> <unk> , and he built a social system , a very efficient operation , <unk> a culture of innovation .
<unk> : I normally sit with a normal <unk> , because I come from <unk> and all of a sudden you can interact with his heart .
There seems to be a soul that has all sorts of confidence there .
E , no matter what you say .
A <unk> in your body , and you respond to this confidence .
There was a woman who had a lot of faith for me , and I had to do it for her .
When we have a <unk> environment , we 're going to define the world with this world , so there 's no DDT .
And what 's helped us .
Even the <unk> are ourselves .
This helps us create a very moral and visionary operating system for the center of the patient .
But during the process , you have to be very efficient to achieve this service , but it 's a surprise that a lot of people are Democrats from McDonald 's .
<unk> : Look , McDonald 's is very simple .
They think they can train all sorts of people around the world , regardless of the same religious , culture , and other things , to create a product for hundreds of different places .
Larry Lessig : And he always talked about this McDonald 's and hamburgers , and it 's all <unk> us .
He wanted to create a <unk> , an <unk> health care system .
JH : Suppose I can offer vision , technology , ways , all sorts of ways to do it in any place in the world .
It 's not a problem .
<unk> : If you think about it , I think it 's the same thing , whether the American people are still Africans , the same thing .
<unk> , the quality of quality and service is the foundation of the <unk> system that we 're designing in design systems .
And of course , our challenge is , we 're talking about the patient 's patient , but our resources are very , very few people who live in <unk> , and it 's a big challenge .
So , we have to have innovation .
One of the early innovations of an early <unk> is that a community is in the community to create a donor , and then let them go like a member of a partners .
There 's a community of community who 's based on community community , where they find themselves , and they 're able to organize the <unk> , the volunteers , then we 're doing what we want to do , to examine their vision , that the doctors are going to try to figure out what 's going on , but they 'll find a little bit of the opportunity , or they will forget the lens , or they 'll forget the lens .
And then , with all the results , doctors are going to end the end , and then <unk> , if they need a glasses , they can get out of the tree , normally , usually below the tree .
But they can choose themselves , and it 's important because I think the lens can help people see , but also a fashion statement , they 're willing to be <unk> for that .
So , they can get a king of glasses in 20 minutes , but for those who need surgery , it 's going to sit in the car , and you go to our hospital .
If you do n't have this license and support , a lot of people would n't get that service , of course , when they need it .
They 're going to get surgery in the next few days , and they 'll come back a day and then they go back the street back to the place where they 're waiting .
This will happen every year .
And maybe a lot of our patients are very excited , a very efficient process , but we 're looking at problems ?
And we did a very good research , and the results were very frustrated , we found that we were just covered with seven percent of the time we had to help help .
So we try to do something different , so we 've got a lot of <unk> <unk> , which we call the <unk> center .
This is a real <unk> in the world , all using electric medicine .
They 'll get a whole - breed <unk> .
We made a concrete camera with a laser camera , and every patient would have a doctor who did a <unk> champion .
And in the first year of the year , our services are 40 percent per million people .
And then the second slide is 75 .
And I think we 've got a process of people who need access to a market market for the market , and then in this process , it uses technology to ensure that most people do n't have to go to hospital .
So , what do they need to pay for ?
And every time the cost of <unk> is <unk> the car , and the price of a car goes up to the city , they just pay 20 <unk> , which can pay for three times .
Another challenge is , how can we make advanced advanced <unk> more flexibility ?
We 're designing images from the mesh network to bring patient images to the hospital , and then in the patient waiting at the same time , it 's going to go back to patients , printing them , to print it and get them to do what they 're doing at a time and they get a doctor who has to be able to get the doctors that they need .
So all of this impacts is one of the basic factors of market growth , because it 's focused on non - remote users , and we can move markets to grow markets .
On the other hand , how do you do that very few times when the hospital is going to increase the quality of surgery ?
So what this video shows is a surgery , you can see here in another room , another patient has ready .
And so , when they do surgery , they 're going to move the microscope to the other side of the room , and we have to do this , because that 's what we 're doing .
So in order to support surgery , I bought labor .
All the people who hired girls are <unk> girls , and they brought the whole institution .
They 're almost doing all sorts of technologies .
They were very excited . It was great .
And it turns out that our cost is very low , but quality and productivity are very high .
So , in fact , the fact is that the production of our employees is much more efficient than anyone .
This is a very busy table , but what it is , is that we have a system that can be safe for quality .
And it turns out that our complications is going to continue far less low than London , so you 're not looking at it .
So the final step in the end is , how do we empower the money to work ? I think most of you do n't get paid .
And our approach is that a lot of them are free , and for those who have the ability to pay , the price of local markets is less than less .
We 're being <unk> by the market of market .
I think this is our inheritance .
Of course , one of the people who had to be able to have a thought to give you .
And the result is , in recent decades , we 're increasing productivity .
Our revenues are growing up in more <unk> , and then we can guarantee that there are healthy , because we need free for a lot of patients .
From absolute numbers , last year we made about 2,000 dollars per year , and 55 million dollars profit , 40 percent of GDP .
But that means we 're going to go beyond what we do , or we 've done , if you really want to solve the blind problem .
So we did some <unk> things .
We 've made a higher amount of money for our own lives , so that the price of our eye is less than a lot of people who are able to enjoy it .
And we 're doing this in a lot of hospitals in India , so many of them are in our own sphere , and there are other areas of the world .
And the result is that the number of dollars that we share in the hospital , their surgery doubled also raises money to improve .
The other part is , how do you scale up the growth of technology ?
And we did n't talk about a price that could be able to <unk> the price of <unk> , and we launched our own <unk> .
So , after a period of time , we have the ability to spend the amount of spending in the two of us .
Now , we believe that seven percent of our markets in the global markets are about 120 percent .
So , what I 'm going to show you is , we 're trying to <unk> this pattern , just to keep it in India or in other developing countries ?
And in order to say , we compare this to the eye of the U.K. and the <unk> of England .
This shows that we 're going to do this in a 60 times the size of the U.K. , the entire country in the entire country .
We 're very ancient .
And we trained about 50 <unk> , and they 're going to train 70 percent of the quality of labor , training and patients .
We 're really doing apple with apple apples .
We look at consumption .
So what I want to say is that this is because it fails in Britain , but the Indian succeeded .
I think there are more .
I mean , I want to see other things .
Maybe it 's going to be in the process of creating productivity , and maybe in terms of a health clinic , or in a clinic where they 're able to pay for <unk> glasses or even in practice .
So , I want to fix these possibilities that maybe most of the countries include the answer to the United States , and maybe President Obama would go down .
Another idea is , I want to leave you with you , when the problem is big when we have a good way of doing it , and I think that I 've already described the process of describing the processes , where you 've found that , you know , <unk> , the quality of the patient , there 's a lot of money .
You can use <unk> , auditory , infection , etc .
There 's a lot of examples that you can do , but I think the most challenging force is in " <unk> . "
Now , how do you create this ?
Now , how do you make people problem ?
That 's a little bit harder .
I 'm sure somebody will find the answer .
So I want to end with this problem with the challenge .
<unk> : When you 're a victim , you think that the world is full of these things , so it does n't have sex .
And what we did was we helped ourselves .
Our final end is that we 're ourselves .
<unk> : Thank you very much .

In anthropology , <unk> <unk> shows three trends about the future of mobile phones . One is <unk> , and the second thing is , the two things are <unk> by the number of other kinds of content .
communication , culture , design , interface design

<unk> <unk> : The form of mobile phones
And I 'm <unk> , and that means that I have a research , which is how to make a digital function .
As you can see , digital worlds are <unk> .
For humans , they do n't change them .
On the other hand , humans are alive .
It 's not glamorous . It 's <unk> .
So my question is how to make avatars .
That 's my question .
If we look at the iPhone 's eye , and we 're going to move on to the level of <unk> . They 're looking at <unk> .
Next question is , what is next ?
Now , I want to show three possibilities .
The first is the quality of the quality .
As a <unk> , we 're absolutely sure that the object is <unk> .
So what can we do that ?
Let me show you a <unk> cell phone for you .
This is a cell box , and there 's a little <unk> on it , so you can feel that part of it .
We can expand it .
For example , we 're going to compare the figures between the physical quality of the equation .
As you move around , it moves forward .
And the number of <unk> technologies are so big as a city guide .
It just needs to be <unk> , like , " Okay , <unk> . This left left . "
And the good thing about it is that you can stand up and look at the <unk> , and it does n't have to be focused on the screen .
OK , quality is first . The second possibility is that the shape is shape .
We 're also going to be <unk> with the physical shape .
If I 've released a book , only two miles thick , but the mobile phone or the <unk> books are very thin , and if you have <unk> pages , I want to feel like <unk> <unk> .
So I 'll show you a <unk> cell .
Okay , a mobile phone is a <unk> box . This is what it can change .
We can make all sorts of shapes .
For example , in your pocket , it 's very thin , <unk> cell phones will make you feel a <unk> , and then you want it to get the interface right .
It 's not just a railway station .
If you change action , it 's also <unk> .
And this is the shape of a <unk> <unk> , and it 's very important to look at the film .
<unk> is easy .
And the other thing is that when you 've got a number of hundred cellphones on the size of the screen .
Like the screen of this project is non - mobile phones , so the shape of your cellphone tells you , " Okay , there 's something .
And you ca n't see it , but it 's there . "
Because you feel that it 's a bit taller .
The shape is the second possibility .
The third is more abstract .
As a human , we are a social <unk> , and we have emotion , so humans .
Can we make a mobile mind ?
If you put a <unk> in your pocket .
We do n't need to do it , and we can feel it .
So let me show you a living cell .
Well , a mobile phone is a cell box , but it has a breath of breathing and <unk> , which is alive .
And you can feel that it 's coming in .
Oh , bad , <unk> <unk> , the new call , maybe a new <unk> .
How do you make it silence ?
It 's going to come out of the <unk> .
This is really <unk> , that 's what we 're doing .
Now , we 're known as three ways to make the digital <unk> of the digital <unk> .
And this is a couple of ways of putting your mobile phone .
And there 's an assumption that there is a assume that , in this case , that is , to make people more <unk> than make technology more human .

When the <unk> <unk> 18 years ago , she feels a huge amount of freedom -- and everybody thinks she 's missing . At her art , her <unk> is <unk> in the world , and she does n't want to go to the World Trade Center .

Mother <unk> : The deep sea on the <unk>
And so the good news is to talk about the <unk> of my life , and it 's giving me freedom and its freedom for me .
And I started looking at a long - term gap between the 16 years of <unk> , and I had a way to change this world .
When I started using <unk> , I immediately felt a new liberal freedom .
Because life has been coming from me .
It was like a new toy .
I can <unk> quickly , and experience it in the face .
I could n't even get out of it .
But even if I were happy to be happy and <unk> , it changed the change .
They do n't look like I was wearing my <unk> .
They seem to be <unk> by their logic , to <unk> how to sit in the <unk> .
When it comes to asked , what people use is that people are using " <unk> " -- " fear " and " sorry " " regrets . "
I mean , I 'm going to tell you that they 're fundamentally changing .
Part of my mind is that part of my mind is <unk> .
I 'm not going to think of myself as a result of what it means to be , but it 's emotional and intense to others .
So I learned that it 's a story that I need to create my own story , a whole new , <unk> story .

I 've been involved in changing these <unk> reactions , " to change the way that I started using <unk> , when I began to use my <unk> .
This <unk> became a plate of mine and entertainment .
When I really started to leave my happy and free position , people were acting very well and surprising to me .
This seems to be the beginning of a new mindset of thinking about patterns .
And we can see that the <unk> attempt to <unk> a person 's ego through <unk> , through the <unk> .
So , in 2005 , I realized that <unk> <unk> can expand the activity of the user interface , but rather , it 's a very exciting and risky aspiration for people who are very excited about <unk> .
So I thought , " How do you put them together ? "
And then , in the last seven years , the <unk> has given me most amazing underwater journey .
And to give you a sense of how it is , I 'm going to share with you one of the things that you share here , which is a fantastic journey to show you how magic it takes to me .
This is my most <unk> experience that I 've ever experienced .
And if I do that , I 'm going to really enjoy <unk> and <unk> , and enjoy the pleasure and the pain of the <unk> and the liberties of the space .
And the most incredible thing is that people seem to be <unk> .
They do n't see the light , and they said , " I 'm going to try it . " " Well , you can do anything .
And I 'm thinking , it 's because they 've seen something that they have never seen before , or that 's beyond the underlying idea of <unk> .
And I think it might have a new kind of freedom in this new way , which is that the freedom of <unk> is in the other person 's life .
And for me , this means that they 've seen a lot of values and its joy , when we do n't have to lose the <unk> and the limitations , and we 'll find that it 's a very exciting amount of force and pleasure .
For me , <unk> became a <unk> tool .
In fact , I 'm calling it to the bottom of the window , because it 's actually going to spread into a new dimension of life , into an organ and a <unk> new organ .
In addition to other people , there is nothing to do with the other ones who are creating new ideas that are created , and there 's this concept that is already contained in cognitive information , right now .
And you 're also part of that .

In the ' 50s and ' 80s , <unk> <unk> talks about the city of cities , to <unk> the problems of <unk> and <unk> climate change , and he 's going to talk about his new account of a new mindset .

Stewart Brand : Four environmental opinions
Because what I 'd like to talk about is that I have to tell you that I have to tell my green attitude .
When I was a little boy , I promised myself as a American person , to protect and <unk> , and that was the <unk> of the air , which is the atmosphere , that the soil , the water and the wildlife , the water and the wildlife .
And I kept this promise .
In Stanford , I <unk> ecology and evolution .
I started a period in 1968 , which I was called " <unk> <unk> . "
And then <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
The creator government , and I have friends and friends of <unk> <unk> , so now , 30 years later , even though our <unk> economy improved 80 percent .
But we have fewer greenhouse gases than anything else .
And in the lower greenhouse gas , it basically basically is equivalent to Europe .
This year , the Earth has a <unk> , and today , I call it " Earth Code . "
Now the main population of the population is that we 've already had this kind of <unk> <unk> process .
It 's about 80 to the rest of the century , and that 's what 's happening in the developing world .
Interestingly , in a large amount of cities , the size of the city is always determined .
Now the largest city is in developing countries , and they 're faster than the countries in the developing world . It 's our nine times .
This is different from <unk> .
When we 're 17 , they 're the driver of history .
Well , what would the world look like a thousand years ago ?
So , now we have a city distribution where we 're going to move across 1,000 years ago .
<unk> , the rise of the West , even though it 's a directory , has ended up .
There 's always a priority . It 's 28 million people coming to town , year .
What 's the point ?
Today , the village around the world are becoming <unk> .
<unk> , because people are moved to cities .
Cities is the opportunity .
Simple .
I 've had a romantic idea about Antarctica , because I never lived in villages .
Because in the city -- this is <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> city , which is built in Nairobi , in cities , has the opportunity .
There are money - making , making people do n't want to go back to the <unk> sub - Saharan Africa .
Go to places where you find a lot of beauty .
There 's a lot of things happening .
They are poor , but they 're highly <unk> , and they have powerful creativity .
Now , <unk> is the people who live in <unk> , and 10 billion people are building cities , which means they 're building <unk> . That 's a kind of interplay , a family , an elder , family - and - family family .
They start fighting , and they 've got a lot of progress .
They even build their own structures .
First of all , <unk> them .
Spring , water , whole range , all of it .
And then it <unk> to improve .
<unk> damage , the situation is n't true . The job is to help create <unk> .
And in Mumbai , half of this city has half the <unk> of the city , but it 's also the GDP of India .
<unk> societies are highly <unk> and dense .
People in <unk> are the most valuable .
That 's what they 're doing .
<unk> , many people think , " Oh , it 's too bad . We have to deal with them . "
" Oh , we have to make them service service . "
Now , they show us how they do the service service .
Now there are all sorts of things that are in the village .
<unk> people are concerned about these things .
And that 's what we can do .
The government can also help help .
That helps you to deal with things like this .
You go to a remote city like Mumbai .
You see the path on the right .
And you say , " What will that happen ? "
And the answer is , " Come on . "
That 's much more than a bicycle . It 's bigger .
It 's more interactive .
The scale is amazing .
The point is that people are not starving .
It 's people who do n't think they 're going to get rid of poverty , and they 're <unk> .
They help it .
They do things by <unk> , called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> economy , it 's like the dark energy of the <unk> physics . This is n't supposed to be , but it is huge .
We do n't understand how it works . But we have to understand it .
Moreover , the <unk> economy , <unk> , and people who are over over time , can get to win the crime , or whether it 's going to be <unk> or into the normal <unk> society .
We should help them make them easier to walk into the <unk> , because if we do n't do that , they will become a rock .
It would have multiple effects .
There 's not only a lot of service in the East <unk> , but also for the entire city .
One of the main activities is these <unk> schools .
The parents are earning a bunch of other teachers to a small , personal , private , engineering school .
In cities , education is more likely to change the world .
So you see some interesting , typical , urban things .
<unk> and rich <unk> , like in Sao Paulo .
This is the value of the city , organic <unk> .
In this case , demand is connected .
Like , in this city , there 's living life on the left side of the city . This is the <unk> of life , <unk> and <unk> walking into a boring , rich <unk> .
They 're amazing .
We 're working on these little <unk> .
The city of the city and the National <unk> is going to make a better way to get better , because cities have a lot of fun .
This can make the city -- that 's allowing the world to become more green .
Because people have to get rid of poverty as well as the <unk> of the poor .
And when they leave the village , natural nature starts very quickly .
And the people who are sitting in the village can have a lot of money to raise food to grow food into the third city .
So if you want to sustain a village , you have to have good roads , or good phones link signals . Better <unk> <unk> .
We 're all in the Earth 's life . This is what it is .
Fifty - <unk> .
These numbers are really big . Now , 100,000 people live in cities .
There will be 10 billion moved to the city .
This is more people who live in their way .
That will affect it .
Now , for all of us , maybe the city of the cities , the most environmental , <unk> , makes the population stop .
People came into cities .
It 's going to be a lot of kids who do n't have to live .
They do n't even have a <unk> , and they 're going to live in cities , and it does n't mean it 's a priority .
And there 's other interesting effects that are happening in this slide , and this is a slide of <unk> <unk> .
This is what happens .
When we have more and more older ones , less kids are born .
They are separate .
And you 'll see that in the northern hemisphere , all the old ones are elderly , old cities .
And in the developing world , the emerging city , young people , are doing something new .
What do you think that 's going to happen ?
I 'm going to move on . Simple talk .
I 'm sorry to say that the news of climate change is more powerful than we think .
The climate is deeply complex , non - linear , <unk> - <unk> , hidden and <unk> face .
Here 's some examples .
And we 're very surprised about all of that .
And from the <unk> of the government , it means that it 's going to increase the amount of war in the next decades of climate change and chaotic wars , like we see in Darfur .
This is the war of ice .
<unk> goes down . There is no lot of money to support that person . And then people have trouble trouble .
Okay , let 's talk about energy issues .
<unk> power is made of a city or an urban planet .
So far , it 's only about three power sources of electric power , coal , oil development , some oil .
One of them is that only <unk> and <unk> are green .
<unk> is why coal is a problem .
Because it 's so cheap , unless governments depend on the power of <unk> , otherwise everybody 's going to use coal .
Wind and sun help do n't have big , because we 're not able to zoom in these energy .
And so the way that <unk> could n't become a major thought of thinking about climate change , or <unk> , this is the low - speed <unk> that will save climate .
If we 're very good at solar power , it can help .
Bear in mind , this is the village and the cities of the world and the cities of the <unk> .
So , in coal , there 's no waste between them .
If you 've always used to use <unk> power , the amount of other things add to <unk> <unk> .
And one of the big ones , a normal , <unk> - <unk> <unk> , burning 80 <unk> per day . Every single day , there 's 100 tons .
It takes hundreds of tons of CO2 in the air .
So , when you look at the growth of these different energy forms and solar cells , the sun and the wind is still close to solar energy . Oh , sorry .
Can you compete with <unk> ?
It 's only to ask the <unk> of Australia .
This is the resource that you see here , not from my ecology , but from the end of the experience , the miners who understand it .
So the good news is , the world 's world , again , is <unk> , and we 're building reactor and start building reactor .
This is the climate .
It 's also <unk> .
And I want to point out that a interesting thing , that 's what the human population likes to refer to .
I 'm not sure that it 's about the local sun and the wind , and wind and oxygen and <unk> .
But , frankly , there 's a little bit of <unk> reactor that 's going to be used .
And in the north , ice melts in Russia , and there 's a new path that people start building <unk> reactor .
They sell these about 35 <unk> of <unk> reactor .
Next is <unk> <unk> .
And this is interesting , for example , about 25 million <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> it with the standard <unk> spray associated with <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
And these are very easy , and it 's very easy .
This is the design of the American <unk> Lab .
And this is the beginning of the <unk> , and it 's already released now .
Almost all of that is not just the small ones , but it can be avoided .
They 're usually submerged in the ground .
Innovation is very quickly .
So I think it 's really important in the future .
In <unk> , <unk> power , in fact , help the <unk> of the nuclear lobe , and the other way is that they 're going to do it .
This is 10 percent of the electricity in this room , and it 's probably about 20 percent .
Half of them are from <unk> <unk> from Russia , and there 's still a <unk> of <unk> .
And I want to see that the <unk> of the Bush government <unk> Foundation is going to continue to continue to move forward .
And I 'm also happy to see Obama in the first weeks when President Obama came to his military bank .
Another topic , which is to kill food as an biologist , to my view of food eating food .
In this case , it 's a cruel , <unk> , terrible event .
Even though they do the best , they 're the ones who make crops in the history of history .
They 're interested in the <unk> of the environment , because they 've got <unk> <unk> to make the soil a little bit more <unk> .
They 've got the use of <unk> .
There 's a lot of food in the area , and there are lots of foods that are much more organic . It 's got more open land land .
By the way , this map has been obsolete in 2006 , but it shows the Africa of green peace and Europe , and they eventually get rid of those control .
And finally , biological technologies are rapidly in Africa .
This is a moral problem .
<unk> <unk> talks about the question of discussion , and with two meetings , it 's a moral responsibility for the moral <unk> of 2030 .
To talk about the truth , <unk> is especially a high - tech , especially in the government , but I know that in a few weeks earlier , the U.S. forces of the United States are about to do something about what 's going to happen , and it 's not the last time , because there 's a real truth .
This is one of the lists .
In fact , it 's more terrifying to know .
There 's a range of events that are going to happen , as soon as we 've ever seen it .
It 's like vacation <unk> .
There are Yves seals .
And because of this event , we might say , " Okay , what can we do ? "
But this is the little question of the Earth . Which is what a institution is to make engineers ? What do they do ?
Because what do we do about this climate change event ?
And if we want to be completely <unk> , we 're going to get rid of the <unk> of <unk> .
But if we say , " OK , China , if you 're worried about it , you do it first .
Your whole way of engineering . We have our own .
This is like the war of <unk> .
And this is really interesting diplomacy .
I 'm going to say , it 's more real than people think .
It 's very focused on the bottom of the climate , a lot of <unk> ideas .
In 1991 , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> ice cap , has <unk> the temperature of the Earth 's temperature for 65 percent .
And the last year , a lot of ice was made of polar bears , and they called them <unk> polar bears .
<unk> up to the stratosphere , 10 billion dollars per year .
All the things we 're going to do about energy , it 's very , very difficult .
Another example of the way that we apply to the ocean is that it 's going to be more active from the sea , and it 's going to affect the <unk> of Earth .
Because it 's able to do a good example of a very small place in a lot of different ways , which is <unk> in the ancient <unk> of <unk> Amazon , not completely burning , and plants do n't have to paste much more organic .
This is our formula .
<unk> Paul is called the <unk> of our <unk> in the human age of human beings . We all agree with this formula .
In the name of the Earth , " We are like God , and we might be able to do it as good as God . "
Now the dot of the Earth is , " We are God , we have to do this character . "
Thank you .

Before a few days before the presentation of the conference , <unk> <unk> in the Gulf of Mexico , looking at the end of a boat , to see the catastrophic effects of oil oil spill , and our societies are looking for new energy , new things that are very high , so we 're stuck with a new amount of risks -- so that we 've got rid of it .
activism , business , culture , economics , science , social change
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : <unk> risk .
I did n't have anything before done before .
I had a research boat for a week in the ocean .
I do n't 'm a scientist , but I 'm working with a brilliant scientific neighborhood from Southern Florida , who 's working on the Gulf of Mexico , and this group is documenting the oil oil spill .
By the way , this is the ship we 're wearing .
I 'm not working with a lot of the things that I do n't know in the very large amount of oil -- for example , birds and ice , dolphins and <unk> and the <unk> .
They 're in a little bit of a very small thing , and these little things are going to eat and eventually eventually end up with very lucky .
And what they 're looking at is to track the amount of oil between the oil and the Arctic , which is a very bad news , because there 's a lot of life .
So it 's about 75 percent of the amazing oil that we 've ever heard about , and we do n't need to worry about it , but it is still still growing .
It 's still affecting the surface of the food chain .
Now we do n't feel weird about this .
Talk about Rachel Kay -- the <unk> of modern environmental ecology -- in 1962 .
She says , control people -- she called them -- using toxic pesticides , like DDT - <unk> , <unk> bombing , just to kill small things , insects , not birds .
But they forget these : actually , birds come out of a lot of the food , and it 's a lot of <unk> .
So the <unk> of <unk> could n't win , <unk> , in the town , grew up and died .
This is the launch of the title , " Spring Spring . "
I tried to figure out what kept me back to the Gulf , because I 'm Canada , and I do n't have any <unk> .
And I think that the Gulf of Mexico is that I do n't think we 've done consensus on what 's going on in this event , and it shows that there 's a rapid fast <unk> in the world , which means that every single day we 're looking at the Earth 's four hours per day .
You know , we 've told ourselves that our tools and technologies are able to control nature , and we suddenly face the <unk> of our <unk> , our lack of control , when oil spill , every time , in the middle , the bottom - to - step attempt to <unk> -- <unk> and <unk> <unk> is the clever idea of oil and old <unk> .
But the power of <unk> from <unk> bears seem to be more glamorous than the <unk> of the poorest bears , which is that people are released , so that <unk> , from the <unk> of <unk> .
And if there 's one thing to make a change in the U.K. , it 's more powerful , and that is , as a culture , we 're not going to be <unk> by these precious <unk> as high - <unk> -- without <unk> <unk> .
And this is n't the last time in the U.K.
Our leaders rely on war , and we have a wonderful story about <unk> and <unk> .
And then the <unk> of a few years of disaster control , <unk> and <unk> , and again , there 's no steering strategy .
The financial crisis of our finance is <unk> <unk> , trying to convince ourselves that this is a new market -- which is the market that does n't stop .
And when this is all <unk> , most of the most smart and smart people try to get rid of finance -- in this case , <unk> a huge amount of <unk> in all sorts of different kinds of gaps .
It 's like the BP oil spill in the U.K. is <unk> , at least a minute , but for a huge amount of cost .
We have to figure out why we 've always let this happen , because we 're in a <unk> <unk> , and what 's going to do about climate change ?
As you know , in this country and in the world , we spend a lot of time on the climate crisis , which is , " What do you do ? "
Now , there 's a more appropriate question -- <unk> Fox -- " If these scientists are correct ? "
Because the climate crisis crisis needs us to do it by preventing principles -- the theory suggests that when human health and the environment is in terrible danger , we ca n't wait to wait for the same scientific analysis .
<unk> is always good .
It 's more obvious that it 's safe to prove whether it is safe , <unk> by the public , which is <unk> , it should be <unk> .
But the climate crisis of the developed world -- if you have this kind of policy -- it 's not based on <unk> , but by the cost of productivity analysis -- looking for a lot of the way that the economist thinks about our GDP .
It does n't depend on what we need to do , and what should we do a little bit of a kind of weird , a strange problem , like , " When are we going to get the real increase before we start ?
Can we be <unk> by 2030 , 2030 ? "
Or we said , " How much can we get this Earth ?
Or raise the price of <unk> , or <unk> -- in the current building -- for four centigrade ? "
By the way , suppose we 're safe to control the planet , the great complexity of the Earth , like it has a automatic <unk> , and it 's not going to depend on the week , but the temperature is no longer the vision of the climate scientist -- that 's not the idea of <unk> .
It comes from economists to think about it .
In fact , we did n't know when the Earth 's <unk> could n't afford the global global warming .
So , why are we going to use this enormous amount of risks in our precious things ?
Now you might expect a bunch of explanations , like , <unk> .
This is a common explanation , and there 's also a lot of evidence , because as we know , it 's a big amount of money .
The other thing that you 've heard of <unk> is <unk> .
And <unk> and <unk> are <unk> , especially when you 're talking about <unk> .
For example , if you 're an 35 - year - old manager , 100 times higher than the doctor 's doctor , and then you need a story that keeps this gap .
You do n't have a lot of choices .
But you do n't have a <unk> <unk> , you can solve it -- you 're not going to make a problem . You 're an intellectual genius .
These are the options -- the genius and the <unk> -- allowing you to fulfill the future to be more powerful in the future .
By the way , Tony <unk> , the CEO of the U.K. Oil , had a marker in his work , and he was inspired by his thesis : " If you know you do n't fail ? "
Now this is a very popular statement , and there 's a lot of <unk> , which I bet you have .
Do n't do it shy .
It 's a good thing to do with failures , if you 're trained to fight or preparing a TED membership , but I personally think that the ability to <unk> us the best of our economy , because -- maybe it 's not a special painting -- but , I 'm going to keep thinking about the possibilities of failure .
Now we have <unk> , <unk> confidence , but because we came up to the next factor , let 's think about another factor of the other factors , a way to fight social methods .
Now I do n't want to go through this , but studies show that the risk of opportunity , the likelihood of the women , is to lose male risks , which is because , as we 've heard , women are more likely to have more <unk> confidence than men .
So we found that <unk> percent of the revenues and <unk> are also -- at least for social purposes .
The other side of the opposite is that you 've been told you have talent , it 's an act of achievement , and it is a lot of <unk> for social achievement .
And this is a problem -- the dangerous danger -- I think , let 's get closer from our population .
Because none of us -- at least in the mid - the hemisphere , whether they 're men or women , they can <unk> these information .
This is what I talked about .
Whether we 're active , they 're still aware of them , and our culture has a certain amount of story , which tells us how to do the <unk> of other people , the future of nature , <unk> and <unk> .
And you think that these stories disappear in <unk> , we 've all forgotten , they 're <unk> .
For example , I was outside the women in the Himalayas , seeing this ad .
This is one of the founders of <unk> , which is , yes , it 's been written , " <unk> a <unk> . "
I 'm showing this ad instead of <unk> -- this is just an accident .
I show it because they 're not <unk> , right ?
We <unk> the natural world , and we won . We always win because <unk> Nature is our inheritance .
But we 're not just talking about nature , not just Nature .
There 's another crucial thing about nature , which is so glamorous that we ca n't be <unk> her .
Let 's talk about Tony <unk> .
The Gulf is a very , very glamorous ocean .
We do n't have the amount of oil that we 've been involved in , and we 're very small . "
In other words , the oceans are <unk> ; she can afford it .
This is the assumption that <unk> <unk> , which makes us sick , becomes possible .
Because this is the actual Prime Minister of our real - time interview : wherever we fall down , even more corn , more water , much more .
The new bubble will replace the old bubbles .
New technology will come up with a technology that we use with technology .
In some way , this is the story of the Americas , and the U.S. has <unk> surfaces , so Europe is here .
This is the story of modern capitalism , because it comes from the fact that the wealth of the land has done our economy , and if you do n't have growth , it ca n't survive .
Now the problem is that this story is always ignored .
The Earth has no limits .
We do n't see it .
Now we 're approaching these limits to these forces .
And I think you all know that , but we found ourselves in a certain narrative .
We do n't continue to talk about the same story of Arizona , and we 're doing more <unk> and crazy and crazy , and it 's really close to escape .
How do you explain what <unk> <unk> does ?
Now , <unk> us " <unk> " , " because God <unk> these resources in the boat , and then she 's going to <unk> them , on the other side , in her special <unk> show that she <unk> Alaska .
It 's a cruel message to that .
<unk> the fear of <unk> us , we 're going to think about it .
This is still not limited .
There 's always a <unk> <unk> .
So stop fear .
In reality , if this leopard <unk> and her <unk> show you .
We do n't hear that we continue to keep the sequence , not change .
Unfortunately , this <unk> is very optimistic .
And the truth is , we 've got a lot of <unk> fossil fuels that we already have to go into a very risk period , extreme energy era .
So this means that it 's in the deepest water <unk> , which is cold , and there 's no way of cleaning it up there .
That means that large <unk> spray <unk> gas and large quantities of <unk> , and other ways we do n't have the way to develop it .
The most controversial thing is <unk> rock .
And I always have a lot of people in Canada who know that <unk> seals are amazing , and it 's going to be <unk> from the ice that comes from the <unk> of the Mississippi .
It 's going to take time to understand this process , because I believe that we can see our <unk> and our path , and nothing else .
This is the place where the tar sands , the <unk> , in the last 95 years .
This oil is not liquid .
It can not just be the ceiling .
It 's swimming in the tar sands . It mixes with the soil .
So you have to get oil , first to remove those trees .
And then you get rid of the upper ice and get the <unk> of the oil .
This process requires a lot of water , and then they 're thrown in large - sized poisonous ice cream .
This is a bad thing to live in the East community , and they have a very high incidence of cancer .
Now , look at these images , it 's hard to understand the scale of this curriculum , and that 's where we 're seeing the size of the space region .
And I found that looking at the biggest byproducts of the soil that brought the dirt to understand the scale .
And the wheel is a person .
My point is that this is n't oil oil .
Not even <unk> .
This is in <unk> .
A lot of <unk> landscapes were destroyed , left the gray ones .
Now , I should admit , this is <unk> , even though it does n't have carbon .
But the truth is , average , the average thing is going to be in the same three times the greenhouse gases of the poorest Canada .
How do you explain this , but is it a kind of crazy way ?
When we know that we need to learn how to live in the surface of the Earth , depend on the sun , the wind and the Arctic , our <unk> energy , we 're crazy trying to imagine the most delicious thing about it .
This is the story of where we grew up to the place where the black hole in my country 's center -- the less oil oil spill -- we 're only lying down there , and we can only sit down and sit at a long clip .
And as <unk> <unk> is introduced to us , this is the civilization of how civilization <unk> self - destructive , and they 're afraid of <unk> ice .
The problem is that our main Prime Minister has had a answer .
In the last minute , we 'll get saving , like every Hollywood movie in the movie .
And of course , our great religious faith is technology .
Now you may have noticed more about this .
And this is the point behind the Earth , and when Earth warms up , we should be able to <unk> <unk> and aluminum particles into the space and <unk> the sun back into space , so it 's going to reduce the temperature of the planet .
And the most crazy project is -- this is n't me -- it 's going to put a rubber hole in the <unk> miles , which is swimming by the balloon , for swimming sulfur .
That 's a lot more pollution to the problem .
Take this as the ultimate <unk> .
It 's a study of serious scientists that have n't been done yet .
They do n't know whether it 's acting , and they 're not aware of what 's going on .
Anyway , in some of the ways of engineering engineering , it 's a trick -- especially the media <unk> -- it 's like , you know , there 's a <unk> .
We 've found a <unk> problem .
And there 's a new field .
But more importantly , we do n't need to change our lives .
For some people , their <unk> are wearing <unk> .
And in other people , their <unk> have painted toes .
We 're extremely <unk> stories .
We need all sorts of stories of heroes who are willing to pay a different amount of risk -- to <unk> the risk of risks , and to bring it to the destination , even for hundreds of thousands of young people , for example , to be arrested by <unk> or against the mountaintop .
We need these stories , and they can be able to grow a linear position for <unk> , which reminds us what we 're doing .
Earth is our only family .
There is no Secretary of State .
It 's called <unk> and <unk> , which is called " <unk> " and the opposite , " which seeks <unk> : This principle reminds us that life is very precious , and ca n't get rid of it .
Thank you .
<unk>
<unk> is in the 1930s at 30 years of the 19th century , John Graham , who tells Charles <unk> 's mechanical engine , <unk> the engine of <unk> , and explains how to see the future , the <unk> daughter and a mathematician .
<unk> , computers , engineering , history , technology , <unk>

John Graham : The greatest machine in the history of history
I 'm going to introduce you to the machine that I call the most greatest machine ever .
It 's a machine that never been established , but it 's going to be shaped by the future .
It 's a machine that 's been designed when people have no idea of computer computers .
If you have some understanding of the computer , you know , there are some simple computers in the early ' 80s , and there 's a little bit of computer notes that we 've seen today .
The first computer is actually at the beginning of the 19th century , in the early ' 80s , not 20 , 40 century .
And it 's designed with some prototypes and a part of the building that 's happening in Southern California .
This machine is <unk> people who call Charles <unk> .
I have this guy who had a feeling for Charles <unk> because all his photos were filled with this kind of thing .
And he 's very wealthy and he can say that the <unk> of the U.K. is in a Saturday <unk> , and if you 're a victim , you 'll be invited to his house -- and then he will invite each person to a <unk> -- a lot of famous people -- so he 'll show you one of his <unk> .
And I was very upset about that period , and then you could go to a bathroom and see a computer computer demos .
But it was a relatively famous mathematician who was born in the late 1800s .
His partner in <unk> , in Cambridge , was funded by Stephen Hawking recently .
And he did n't have these people , because he had only created this machine , but it never really did .
And that 's why he 's a typical cartoonist .
And he had a good idea , and he would think , " Ooh , I 'm going to make it work .
I 'll have a lot of money . But I have a better idea .
So I did this . No , I should make it . "
And he 's always doing that , until Robert <unk> , who is <unk> him from 10 times a day , and he says , " Well , you have a happy day .
And what he 's designed is that this huge thing is this big thing , analyze the engine . Now , let 's explain it 's a <unk> .
Each of these <unk> is a steering street , so that 's the big thing about a <unk> <unk> .
As I said , I want you to imagine this big machine . We can hear this beautiful sound of sound .
Now , I 'm going to introduce you to the structure of the machine , and that 's why this is the field of the computer , and tell you this machine is a computer .
And we 're going to talk about the <unk> of the computer , and it 's almost what it is to do with the computers , but the gears for the wing , for 30 bucks , for 30 engines , so it 's a lot of high - speed steering , etc .
Imagine a hundred hundreds of times , and they have a lot of them on it .
This machine is a <unk> . All the stuff is <unk> .
And he wants to <unk> <unk> , but the problem is that the machine is <unk> .
So it 's a <unk> .
This is what it is .
They 're all about this .
This huge thing is <unk> , or the chip .
Yeah , that 's right .
It 's totally <unk> . That machine is all .
This is a picture of an image of the <unk> museum from Science Museum .
<unk> can do four basic elements for the metal , but it can also do a lot of computers to do something that can make decisions that do n't want to decide .
It does n't work for the programmers , and it 's actually a computer .
You can calculate it . It 's not just computation .
Now , let 's look at this , stop thinking about the chip , and we ca n't even see what it is . It 's very small .
But if you look at this , you can see something very similar to this .
This is the incredible complexity of <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> .
If you 've ever seen a picture of a <unk> photo , you 'll see it . It looks like it 's very complex .
All of these chairs are doing what 's done with a computer , but certainly you have to give this program to the last 50 years , in the ' 50s , ' 60s , which is <unk> . This is one of the three types of <unk> , and it 's a program that 's in front of a scientific museum , where you 're going to go and see it .
But there 's a lot of that .
He designed some programs , expecting it .
And the reason for that is that a lot of <unk> , because there 's a <unk> in French who 's created <unk> <unk> -- and he 's going to use these amazing patterns , and then he was in the 16th century , to all the other things that he had at the end of the 19th century .
<unk> wants to use technology , so it 's something that is <unk> .
He needs some <unk> .
Obviously you have a computer .
There 's a lot of cards , <unk> , and <unk> .
You still need some <unk> .
There are no ones who do n't have the voice , and you have a voice . You can do something wrong if there 's anything wrong -- or machines need a <unk> when you do it .
There 's a truth in <unk> , and it says , " <unk> <unk> . " And you can imagine " Window ! "
So you can imagine all of these noise , dancing <unk> , winning the <unk> engine and <unk> engines . " Right ?
You also need a printer , of course , everybody needs .
This is a picture of a piece of paper that 's called " <unk> <unk> , " and he does n't build it , but the museum museum is in 80 and 90 ' 90s .
It 's a pure <unk> printer .
It 's only printing the figures , because he 's obsessed with numbers , but it 's able to print it on paper , and even if you get to the bottom line , it 's <unk> <unk> .
You need images , right ?
If you want to do something about the image , so he said , " Well , I need a <unk> , and I have a lot of <unk> and a leopard , which can <unk> . "
So he designed a <unk> in that time , and he had a good machine .
This woman , of course , is <unk> <unk> .
Now , imagine this social <unk> , all of these people who have come up with this .
This woman is crazy , <unk> and dangerous daughter , her mom worried about her daughter and she thinks , " I know how to fix it . "
We get her math . This is her . "
Because I 've never seen a mathematician , so that 's why it 's good .
And everything 's going to be a better thing , so she started to learn about mathematical learning and to her mother to a social party and then <unk> his machine .
And <unk> <unk> is there , <unk> demos his machine , and then she understood that she 's only the only person in his life , she says , " I know what the machine 's going to be like . "
She 's very big for us , because there 's a lot of people who want to make it because of the machine .
Now , some people call her the first programmers .
This is actually from her article .
This is a sequence of a certain kind of paper .
But in history , she does n't really have the first programmers , and she did something more amazing .
It 's not just a programming <unk> , she saw something that did n't see .
He was obsessed with math .
And he wanted to build a machine that could be able to make a mathematical machine , and then she said , " You ca n't do math in this machine . " In this room , they have cell phones .
If you look at your mobile phone , every item on the computer , or any other motor device , it 's all mathematical equipment . In the bottom .
It does n't matter whether it 's a video or a text or the music , all the number of <unk> , and it says , " It 's only because you use math and signs not like those things , like music . "
This is a huge leap because the <unk> says , " We can calculate this mysterious functional , and then <unk> the mathematical shape and the image -- and -- but they say , as you give it to the form of music , it allows you to use it . "
And that 's what I said about <unk> <unk> .
And when you say she 's an entrepreneur , she is really the real important thing about what the future can be as the first programmers .
Now , the man came up , and there were people coming up in the <unk> <unk> . In <unk> , he reinvented computers .
And of course , the machine 's machine is pure mechanical .
The <unk> machine is <unk> .
These people come from thinking about the mathematics , but it 's a very important thing to tell us .
And he 's in <unk> , and he says , " How do you make computer computers and not important . "
It 's like mechanical computers , or electron , and it does n't matter whether it 's cells -- or in the future , but as we go into nanotechnology , once we enter nanotechnology .
We can go back to the <unk> machine , making it smaller . All these things are computers .
And there 's an <unk> underlying nature .
This is called <unk> <unk> .
So all of a sudden , you know what the connection is , it 's a computer .
In fact , it can actually do anything we can do with computers , but it 's extremely slow .
And if you want to know about <unk> , it 's <unk> .
It uses <unk> <unk> as an input , which is a factor of 100,000 .
But it 's a <unk> group .
You can expand it .
Well , what does this thing give us today ?
We have plans .
There 's tens of thousands of schemes that are written in the Whitney museum Journal of paper and hundreds of pages of photography on this analysis .
One of the things we called it " <unk> 28 , " which is a charity that I 've been working with , and I 'm the founder of Science , who 's the Scientific Museum -- and he 's going to send the project to the plan of building the encyclopedia , the projects that we 're building in the building .
In South Africa , we analyzed engines .
There 's a lot of them .
And part of that is the printing of the <unk> .
This is done . The second one is learning what all of these schemes should be built .
And the third part is that the machine is a computer , and it 's the last thing that 's really <unk> in the museum of scientific museum .
And when it 's made , you really understand how computers work , because there 's a very small chip in front of you , and you can see this huge amount of stuff and say , " Oh , I 've seen jobs in work . I can hear it . "
We 're going to do a simulation .
And when you <unk> the engine , it would have a lot of <unk> for the future .
And of course , he never came out , because he was always wasting his new plan , but in the ' 60s , all the things had changed at the 1940s .
Now , I 'm going to show you what it looks like a little video , and it 's a video that shows you how to work .
This is the three - year - old spring , and it 's ready to do addition to other people , and that 's what you can imagine .
Just five years for me .
When we start , we 've got it .
Thank you so much .

With a lot of images of this project , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> Ritchie , showing us about three major projects about humanity and our planet -- a series of <unk> photos of the Earth , and the second thing is , " The <unk> Earth " is in his website , he 's documenting the world 's " <unk> " and " the ' 60s ' ' " ] ' <unk> ' ] " " That 's the case for the <unk> of a population .

Yves <unk> : The Earth 's Earth
And since I flew to this , I had the impact on the Earth .
I 've got a hundred billion CO2 in the air . This is exactly the two Ford .
I 'm here to talk about the ecology of ecology , but my CO2 emissions have been consumed by the same amount of CO2 .
How do I do that ?
When I go home , I 'm going to get suicide ?
What I want to do is have a way of <unk> CO2 . I do it every time .
And actually my job is to show the impact on the Earth .
I 'm going to show you some of the photos I 've made .
<unk> sands , right .
We know this problem , but we do n't have it .
<unk> people , seven hours a day , work 24 hours per day to collect as much oil .
We all know oil will go .
<unk> are not a long - term solution .
But our oil used to save more than two years of oil .
But we <unk> .
<unk> this fact .
Ninety - eight percent of the coral bears .
Because global warming , the coral people will be extinct in 2050 .
We know that the corals are very sensitive to temperature , and they 're also important for diversity .
That 's the Arctic . It took this picture last summer .
When I was 15 years old , I had shot this image .
This is now a new <unk> of the Atlantic and the Pacific .
Since since 1960 , the Arctic 's ice has doubled over 90 percent .
This is the <unk> of <unk> , which has disappeared away .
<unk> images .
It 's already missing 80 percent of the <unk> .
In addition to scientists , in the next 100 years , the mountain <unk> will disappear .
It matters very important to life on Earth .
And as Al Gore says , there are 20 billion people who live in the world depend on the ice .
Talk about <unk> .
<unk> humans are living longer by fishing .
Today , 70 percent of the glaciers in the farm are <unk> .
And according to <unk> , if we do n't change our ice , we 're going to lose resources in 2050 .
We 've never seen it .
This is a beautiful image that left Africa .
One person in the world has a lot of food .
So this is a hundred billion people that have no good food .
In Africa , corn is one of the major food factors .
In the United States 90 percent of the harbor corn is used to feed animals or to make organisms like <unk> .
In <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Every year , there are 150 square miles per year .
Darfur 's refugee camps .
Today , there are 2,000 million people in the world today .
And according to the United Nations , we will have two billion <unk> .
I always show my photos on the street .
We 've done it in 100 cities .
But how do you get better understanding of the silent world ?
The landscape is enough .
Obviously I 'm going to do another project .
I started a project called " The <unk> of <unk> billion people . "
I have six <unk> to the world and ask the same question about life .
We 've completed 5,000 times .
And I 'm here to show you this .
The first man : What 's the most beautiful thing in my life ?
That 's when my dad told me , " Come here , I 'll give you the girl . "
One woman : love , love is the best thing I can get .
Two men : Juliet and Juliet , <unk> and <unk> , leopard and glue , that 's the love of love !
Number two : You ask me a <unk> question .
<unk> : Because I 've done what I want to do , so I feel so happy .
The fifth man : I think , first of all , what I learned was that .
<unk> : ... from my children , the fifth men are <unk> , and how happy we are .
<unk> : We invented stories , and we can go beyond the world , but we could imagine in our <unk> .
Man : I <unk> .
Man : You 've got to know , family ... <unk> .
Man : Life , your life is only one .
Guy : Who is I ? Is this important ?
<unk> men : If I can go back to Iraq , I think there 's a lot of people who say , " I have to hire them to vote .
It was like when I was going to kill a woman in Iraq , she had to kiss my feet .
I feel ashamed .
I was moved to my strength , and I made my sense of treaties .
I 've never seen that necessary for Iraq .
Number two : Dad , mom , I grew up .
You do n't need to worry about me . His dad does n't have to work .
That 's my home . How do you say it ?
When you say , my home is poor , and I 'm just going to show you a little bit of money here . Let 's make a lot more money to try and try to make it feel very rich .
I do n't want them to live in a very poor way .
And if I did that , I was very successful , and the first thing I 'd like to thank you is my parents .
" <unk> , mother , thank you .
And thank you for inviting me to me , and I 'll make it today . Thank you . "
<unk> men : I 've spent seven years in my <unk> , but it does n't have to be <unk> life .
A lot of people say I could n't surfing the world , and I went to <unk> .
I 'm going to prove that I can .
And I think that all of this is deeply <unk> , and relates to life , because in the Earth , we have some ways of force , mental , mind or body .
I just had a little <unk> on my body .
<unk> men : Well , you 've got each other .
No matter where you come from .
You do n't know what I , you know .
We do n't have each other .
If I really love you . I 'm going to give you a cow and a lot of other things that we 're friends .
And we 're doing each other .
JH : You can get into this website . Let 's answer these questions .
There are 40 problems .
I 'm going to talk about my film now .
In the last three years , I shot a film about Earth .
It 's called " <unk> . "
It 's a film about a Earth change .
It 's also a story about life .
And I 'm proud of you to show you this .
Video : These are four billion years old .
These plants have already been a hundred years old .
And yet we have the history of <unk> , only 20 million years old .
We 've managed to adapt to the entire Earth , and we 've reached the entire Earth .
<unk> , we 're nurturing our children , but we do n't look like millions of other species in our lives .
Over the last 30 years , I was fortunate to look at Earth from <unk> and its <unk> .
Our lives depend on our Earth .
We depend on water , forests , desert , desert , oceans .
fishing , <unk> , agriculture , these are the first human activities of the world .
It does n't have us divided ourselves together , and it did n't make us separate .
We all share the gift of the Earth 's body . We 're going to get beyond itself .
And yet , we started playing high - speed <unk> .
Today , our biggest fight today is to protect our Earth 's nature .
In less than 50 years of human history , we have become completely changing our homes .
Half the world 's deforestation has disappeared .
It 's a lot of water .
<unk> made the soil barren .
Our energy is <unk> .
climate change is changing .
We 're attacking ourselves .
We just want to improve our lives .
But <unk> is in the <unk> .
We do n't know what the Earth 's going to do is <unk> us .
We know that can be possible .
We have an ability to change the future for a better future .
So what do we do ?
JH : Yves <unk> .
This film is different from the movies .
This is going to be free to launch free .
It does n't have copyright .
In six months of the day , the environment can be downloaded this film on the Internet .
In six months , television and cinema are <unk> free of free films .
This is a film that does n't have any <unk> .
Of course , also provides school , cities , NGOs and NGOs .
We have to figure out what we know .
Let me tell you .
It was n't <unk> , it was too late .
But we can make a force that makes a difference to the Earth .
And finally , I want to welcome a new baby of <unk> , and they 're starting to have this talk before .
Thank you . I love you .

The famous <unk> of the <unk> is to show them that they 're magic , convenience , <unk> and <unk> , and now you 're <unk> ...
collaboration , entertainment , humor , physics
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Dan <unk> : Hey , let 's take a bite . Let 's go .
<unk> : There 's a lot of high - tech chairs here , and when it comes to the top , I think these are all kinds of people who are evolving -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> : Obviously , these are n't our traditional performance . This is what we 're going to learn . Can we try and inspire the music ?
<unk> : Very good . <unk> , fantastic . You 're great .
Excellent . Excellent .
<unk> : Thank you .
<unk> : When they do this , they 're going to keep it .
You actually did this .
That 's what this extra effort brings us to today .
<unk> : Okay , let 's show you a little bit about it .
<unk> : This does n't require a license .
Well , look at this , all sorts of different <unk> .
Sorry , TED is about innovation . <unk> : Yeah .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> demos some of the <unk> captured , and he 's developed it .
Now , Dan 's going to show you some things that he invented .
<unk> : One of the paintings that I 've developed in my own impression about another <unk> show .
<unk> : No .
<unk> : This is a little <unk> .
<unk> : Ladies and gentlemen , this is <unk> <unk> , not just to give you a silence , but certainly .
<unk> : Yeah , yeah .
<unk> : Ooh , Daniel Daniel .
<unk> : Again .
Excellent .
Excellent .
OK . <unk> : Ooh , thank you .
So let me show you , I 'm going to play with six <unk> .
In order to show you six or six , I have to control it for three <unk> .
Another three in my eyes .
<unk> : Good luck .
Now , there 's six <unk> , and I 'm going to give you one or two .
Try , give up .
I 'm going to try and do that , try and try and determine what ?
<unk> : Yeah , good ideas .
<unk> : And he 's looking at me .
<unk> : Yeah , he does that . Okay .
<unk> : Yeah . <unk> help .
Oh , yeah .
<unk> : Well , you know , a few years ago , when you 've got a number of years , it 's our practice , Richard <unk> , and Richard . We often play the <unk> parachute on our performance and you can see that they 're Daniel <unk> .
We 're thinking , " OMG . "
<unk> : I 'm sorry that we can do that <unk> design ?
<unk> : I want to wait the next one .
<unk> : <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah , we 've found how to make this show .
He actually does something more dangerous than this .
<unk> : Hey , Richard .
.
<unk> : Richard , please .
<unk> : Yeah , sorry .
<unk> : Ooh . Richard , <unk> .
Richard <unk> : Can I say <unk> ?
<unk> : No .
<unk> : Every year , every year I 've been working on this show , this is what I do n't know , and I 'm not sure , it 's true .
<unk> : Yeah , please stand up .
God , I hate that . Put your hands like this . Thank you .
<unk> : From the past . This is -- this is -- it 's -- this is -- it 's -- you know , we 're going to stand up with it ...
<unk> invites me to get the balloon , but now you protect him .
It looks pretty elegant .
<unk> : Wow , you 've got to die .
<unk> : No , <unk> .
<unk> a little bit of time , right , good , good .
Well , let 's start .
Let him take your wrist , so I can do it .
<unk> : Please hold my wrist in a second .
<unk> : Good job .
Okay .
Okay , keep it .
<unk> : Yeah .
<unk> : The first one .
<unk> : These are all people in these years .
<unk> : So Richard , we 're on the list , right ? <unk> ?
Here 's what happened .
<unk> : I think we 're here .
.
You 're not born .
<unk> : Yeah , I 'm not going to believe .
<unk> : <unk> , I 'm going to start .
<unk> : Again , wait again .
<unk> : We 've done this .
<unk> : Can I grab balloon ?
<unk> : Yeah , you do n't want to grab it . Believe me .
<unk> : Can you look at the legs ?
<unk> : <unk> , you want to do that ? Yeah .
So again , human beings , I do n't want them very quickly .
Can you get a <unk> ?
<unk> : Ooh , humanity .
<unk> : Yeah . I 've always tried to do that .
<unk> : Let 's jump on this direction .
Now , we 're going to take the Richard <unk> of our own peril of our own peril .
So , in order to do this , I 'm going to use these three sinister toes .
If this is n't enough , your response is also the same .
<unk> : Whoa , hope can be more sharper .
<unk> : Yeah . Barry .
<unk> : I 'm running out of it .
<unk> : From my shoulders .
<unk> : From his shoulders .
<unk> : That 's in the air . It 's on the <unk> .
It 's still in <unk> .
You say , do n't you ?
<unk> : You say , magic ?
<unk> : Why do n't you say that ?
<unk> : We started .
<unk> : You say , <unk> boy ?
<unk> : This guy invented air .
<unk> : Yeah .
Even a pencil .
<unk> : He invented his <unk> .
<unk> : Okay , we started this <unk> , but remember we spent 10 years to refine it .
<unk> : So what do you see for a decade ?
<unk> : No , it 's not that difficult , we do n't like exercise .
<unk> : There is too much , it 's a problem .
In fact , we 're going to prove that they might be <unk> -- they could burst -- both <unk> .
<unk> : Does anybody have a little animal that 's going to come to the bottom ?
Or it 's a brand new book .
<unk> : Nothing .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> ?
<unk> : She went to the farm and went ?
<unk> : Are you a little animal ?
It 's just <unk> . OK , we start .
<unk> : Forget your head , kill the head .
<unk> : How do you feel , Tony , right ?
<unk> : Yeah .
<unk> : That 's all you feel good ? <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : There is a little bit of <unk> .
<unk> : All right ?
<unk> : Yeah .
<unk> : Okay , we started .
<unk> : That 's a little bit , who 's responsible for the lights ? You can go through my eyes ? I can see a bit .
<unk> : The size of the wing , we still are lonely .
We get tired of it .
<unk> : Well , far beyond the visual .
<unk> design -- completely different things .
<unk> : So preparation . Yves : <unk> .
<unk> : Can you put our music ?
Can you do it ?
<unk> : They 're good staff !
<unk> : Ooh , ooh .
<unk> : Next .
<unk> : Okay .
<unk> : Yeah ? Oh .
<unk> : Sorry .
<unk> : I think my part is hard .
<unk> : When you can .
<unk> : There we go .
Come on , jump , fast , jumping .
You jump .
Wow , good , stop .
<unk> , nobody dancing . Only we have this .
It 's certainly not very comfortable .
<unk> : French mania .
<unk> : A number of times .
<unk> : French mania gave Yves <unk> .
<unk> : Well , everybody knows .
<unk> : Yeah . There 's another side .
<unk> : Tell them what we 're doing .
<unk> : Well , some of our experience you might know . We 've got two worlds .
Whether you do n't believe it or not , you ca n't <unk> the world .
We 're going to show you a little bit about the <unk> that we 're doing with other teams .
<unk> : Yeah .
Okay .
I know what you 're thinking , other <unk> .
<unk> has bad <unk> .
But anyway , there 's a <unk> in my feet .
And look at it with a twins .
.
And there 's another neighborhood running around .
You want me to do it .
Richard . Richard , you tell him . This is your last year .
This is a nice opportunity , Richard .
Well , a good opportunity .
I 'm going to use my <unk> .
Okay .
I learned that <unk> had caught down the door . Yves <unk> was caught .
All right .
I met , van . That 's enough .
The important thing is , it 's progress .
How ? Ooh , try again .
Oh , it 's in you , van .
And there 's a whole full <unk> .
Yeah , pretty strange . You do n't think it 's half of the encyclopedia . Yes , yeah , too weird .
Look , I 'm going to move <unk> to my feet .
Wow . So , <unk> , Barry .
So , look at that .
Oh , Tony , right ?
You 're my hero , you are my little shoes .
A lot of Olympics .
From my foot on my feet , I 'm going to pop up my <unk> .
Why , <unk> , where ? Tell us . <unk> .
<unk> your next statement . What would it be ?
What kind of knowledge ?
What kind of <unk> do you have ?
Are you one ? Tony .
And this is the final answer : What 's your final answer ?
Okay . You have to shut the television .
Okay , good . Okay .
From my foot on my feet .
We can play seven .
From six to seven . <unk> : This is a <unk> .
Yes .
<unk> : When you 're ready to prepare .
<unk> your tongue . Barry versus <unk> .
Oh , ooh , <unk> .
Please , please . <unk> . Thank you .
Because now we 're going to make it more difficult . We 'll put these seven <unk> on top .
Seven of <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah .
<unk> : Thank you , that 's the way .
<unk> : Thank you folks .
<unk> : Thanks very much .

From the Zen of <unk> , Richard <unk> tells us how the gene is cheap and rapid , rapid <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
DNA , biotech , health care , science , technology
<unk>
Richard <unk> : Welcome to the genetic Revolution of the gene
Ladies and gentlemen , I 'm going to show you the Human Genome .
The first is the first chromosome .
<unk> is <unk> .
Women have two <unk> of this big X - chromosome , and there 's a little X man , of course , a little X - y man .
Ladies , sorry , that little guy makes you different .
And if you zoom in on this <unk> genome , of course , the code of this double - life structure is based on these <unk> letters , or the letters of the <unk> , right ?
How many of the human genome have this structure ?
A big number ?
Anyone can talk about big numbers .
But then , if I put a <unk> on this <unk> , I 'm going to show you a little bit about the <unk> of the screen .
So this is very big .
And maybe the scale of this scale is a group of people -- they 're all makers of the Y chromosome .
15 years later , it took about 40 billion <unk> of <unk> , and releasing it .
And the end of 2003 , " <unk> " and they kept doing it .
These are all made of this machine .
It 's a cost of two dollar dollars , and it 's very slow .
But you tell you , I 'm telling you the world 's big story , and you do n't know .
What I 'm doing now is to make a genome that 's going to replicate 50 , and then <unk> into 50 <unk> and <unk> large and large <unk> .
And then the software <unk> and gives you a clue .
To get you more intuitive to the human genome : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : There 's a week in the machine .
This summer will be inspired by the <unk> of 600 and the growth of this growth .
So the price of <unk> is less than a <unk> .
And this is as if you 're in the car in 1998 , and you get to two and a half later to Jupiter .
The world population , the <unk> of the world , <unk> Moore 's chief <unk> methods , and then it 's all these new <unk> .
Ladies and gentlemen , this is a logarithmic scale , and you 're not going to get it wrong .
So the capacity for the world , the ability to <unk> , is that it 's about 1.5 to 100,000 people .
This is based on machine <unk> .
And this will be <unk> in the future , and it 's going to be <unk> , and it 's going to be <unk> .
There 's actually a hundred percent of the lab in the laboratory .
It 's about <unk> .
The Chinese are not starving in this new moon .
What does this mean for <unk> ?
If a female - old woman .
She had a child in <unk> breast cancer .
She 's undergoing surgery , <unk> and <unk> .
She goes home .
Two years later , she found the <unk> C - <unk> .
And unfortunately , we have surgery and chemotherapy .
And three years later , she was 42 years old , and she received more <unk> .
She had six months later on <unk> <unk> .
And finally , death later died later .
And the first 10 years of her care is that she 's going to take care of it .
And because of that , for example , my colleague , Rick Wilson , who 's working with <unk> , decided to decide to her <unk> .
And he <unk> his skin , <unk> liver cells , healthy liver rays and <unk> , and he grabbed all the volumes of the genome .
And he uses software to use his software with two groups of software , and he found that 30 billion cellphones have lost the gene in a gene called <unk> .
If this gene happens , 90 percent of the time is <unk> .
And unfortunately , it does n't diminish the woman , but it 's important for her family .
And if they have the same mutations , they get the gene tested , and then they understand that they 're going to be able to get <unk> and find a huge amount of life .
So let me introduce you to <unk> , they were diagnosed with <unk> .
And their mother is a very brave woman who does n't believe that she 's going to get sick from her <unk> and the Internet to search for medical care , and they <unk> another disease .
It 's <unk> <unk> .
So with a painting of photography -- <unk> healing , they 're not entirely stopped yet .
There 's still a huge problem there .
And the men in the photo are really fortunate , and he 's a company called Life 's company .
This company is one of two members of the genome for the genome .
So he grabbed his child .
And they found that the <unk> of the gene <unk> in the form of <unk> , the functional <unk> associated with <unk> .
So , except for a textbook , they do n't have a cure for <unk> drugs .
You have no genome ; you do n't have the genome .
And I spent 10 dollars a few years ago .
Today is a million dollars per year .
She was a hundred years later .
That 's so fast .
This is a little portrait of <unk> and <unk> .
Nick <unk> gets <unk> his stomach , like famine .
It 's not because he ca n't eat it , but his <unk> is open to the <unk> .
And after a lot of surgery , he looked at her mother and said , " Mom , <unk> , I 'm really miserable . "
And his spinal cord has happened in the background , and he does n't know where the problem is , he says , " Let 's make a genome . "
And then they found that the gene that died in the <unk> , and they found a <unk> mutation .
So the production is that he has a <unk> response to food , and it 's a natural response , it <unk> cells dead .
But this is what the gene does .
So for this question , he received a lot of money .
In nine months of <unk> , he can eat <unk> <unk> .
Use the <unk> of the genome as the Internet intervention is coming forward .
It 's today , right here .
This is what it means that we can survive for 20 years , because it 's because of this technology .
This is an amazing story of the world , of course , the human expansion and the ability to beat food .
But this technology can also be used by <unk> new corn , soy and birds and all sorts of other foods that can adapt to deserts and floods and <unk> .
And as population population , we have to use <unk> products , which is my only point .
And unless anyone in the audience 's decisions .
No , nobody .
This is a <unk> anniversary of a decade ago .
In fact , <unk> is completely replaced .
And then there 's more <unk> <unk> .
But , most <unk> .
Or Bob <unk> was invented by the <unk> of the computer computers to change everything .
Suddenly we have <unk> , Yahoo and <unk> and then the whole Internet .
But do n't worry about the Republican bank , Facebook and save us , of course .
This is what we are today .
This is the beginning of the gene , the beginning of the gene .
So what I want you to think about is : if these dots are n't binary , the gene on the planet , which means what ?
I bought 10 years later .
I was asked to say , " A <unk> . I never had the genetic test , B , I 've got , <unk> C , but I do n't say that .
Very lucky , I can also pick up the A. I do n't know if my insurance <unk> is <unk> .
What if I have a C ?
<unk> consumption is going to be much more powerful .
Do you want to know if you do n't want to know the gene ?
Are you going to do that in your iPhone ? There is a application .
Anybody want a personal <unk> <unk> ?
There 's now a laboratory for <unk> gene , which is called " <unk> genes . "
Who today is more than half the other half of the time you 're going to get to the laboratory , and you 've got her <unk> , and you 've heard about it .
Do you want to pick a <unk> president ?
Suppose this is , now , it 's not only about the Grand Canyon of <unk> , but her personal genome , and her personal genome .
It looks good .
And she asked other players doing this .
Is n't that possible ?
Do you think that 's John McCain ?
How many people in the audience are in my same book , <unk> ? Please raise your hand .
Anybody ? No .
Obviously , there are one .
My dad is <unk> , one of the <unk> Brothers .
They 're not like each other .
They 've got different locations in the world .
So , as I 've met , I have relationships with me , but I do n't know .
Imagine if my genome is recognized , in a three - dimensional genome , there 's a software genome that can interact with two .
<unk> , my company has similar software .
So if you look at it , if the software is <unk> , you want to meet with your three cousins ? "
If all of those people say , " <unk> <unk> ! Welcome to the chromosomes .
That 's probably a good thing .
You have a family .
It could be bad .
How many of you have this room ? Please raise your hand .
Well , experts think you 're in the middle of three to three people , not your dad .
This -- these are the genome , which is 23 chromosomes , and they do n't mean that our relationship or our social nature -- at least not yet .
Like any new technology that does n't work with human beings , it 's very good for us .
So I 'm strongly interested in all of you and participating in the gene that you have around you .
Thank you .

Daniel <unk> demos his bone -- very quickly , a very rapid <unk> , which is a huge amount of resistance to donor suffering , and he suggests that the adult stem cells are treated with a lot of disease , from <unk> disease to heart disease .

I 'm a stem cell in the University of cancer stem cells in Stanford , and the point that I 've been working on is the same thing .
<unk> Burt demos talks about me today , and I do n't have the brain of the human brain .
In fact , it uses the lives of thousands of people . Most of them have <unk> and <unk> or <unk> , or other diseases .
A few years ago , I was doing <unk> research in Stanford .
In the room , I gave Bob surgery . He 's an employee .
In order to save a liberal child , we 're going to <unk> his bone to the United States .
So , how do we collect it ?
ooh , we have professional operating rooms , local anesthesia , nurses and sisters , and I <unk> with my nurses .
Bob 's <unk> in <unk> , you know , not special .
And what we normally do is , we 're going to do it through the social organizing tissue , in the <unk> hole , to the left -- and this is a medical term -- it 's a medicine <unk> , a <unk> bone .
And I put a nurse in my nurse , and she 's collecting her bone .
And I 'm going to give you a little bit of that . We 're so close .
It 's usually 200 times .
And after the end of the surgery , I was able to do it with a hundred years later , and it 's more than Bob -- his reputation looks more like this , Switzerland .
You know , this method has changed over 40 years .
Maybe there 's a better solution to that .
And so I thought about a way of trying to figure out a way of <unk> .
That 's it .
It works .
We do n't normally know the patient .
You do n't have to get a lot of money , but it 's just going to go into the <unk> and the back .
And this <unk> , the <unk> of motivation , has a special amount of metal in the upper metal , and it can go into the underside of the bone and move through the glass .
So , you can be able to collect a lot of dust through a group of occasions and <unk> .
And you can do it much more different than the other activities that you do .
It does n't need mechanical operations .
So this is very quick , and Bob 's just one <unk> , local anesthesia , no longer <unk> .
I 've got a little money funded for Stanford and doing some models .
<unk> show that this invention is .
We developed this technology .
And then we found two of the large animals in two big animals .
And we found that it was a bit more <unk> than the average grid , and we did n't only have the bones , we had 10 times more growth .
The FDA was just celebrated this invention last year .
And you can see the example that the patient 's population is moving through the <unk> path .
It 's from the same group , one patient , two <unk> collecting .
You do n't need to have local anesthesia .
We 've found three to six times more stem cells in the same patient .
So , why do you care about it because it 's stem cells very rich .
You all know the <unk> stem cells .
They had a big potential , but they did n't have a clinical study .
The adult stem cells are spread throughout the body , including the <unk> stem cell . It 's all about 40 years .
In the last decade , a lot of <unk> <unk> stem cells to treat the other diseases , like heart disease , blood disease -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> -- even on <unk> , <unk> <unk> syndrome and diabetes .
We 've launched the <unk> of the past year , and we 're injecting it up .
And hope is , this invention is more stem . It gets better applications .
<unk> people to create more people , when the bone is <unk> to save lives .
And when you 're young and health , you can also store stem cells , once you have to use it .
And finally , if you look at the photo of the image , we 're going to do this every year in Stanford .
Hopefully this technology can save more patients .
Thank you .

<unk> and <unk> face showed a new <unk> of controversy : this model may be solved all the original problems . This is probably the most beautiful thing you can see .
physics , science , technology
<unk>
Charlie <unk> 's climate theory of climate change
And you can see that this is good for me .
And in the next 18 minutes , I 'm going to take a look at the beauty of particle physics in the next 18 minutes .
People found a lot of things in the coral .
The coral is a very glamorous , dysfunctional animal .
Each ice is composed of thousands of independent <unk> .
They 're constantly growing into the same community as neighbors .
Suppose these reefs have <unk> <unk> , we can actually grab a simple question to ask him .
Why do you 've come up with this place in this position , rather than anywhere else -- is the fate of the accident ?
After the global warming , he said , " Well , that 's stupid .
And you know that this coral , sometimes , is really not the markings of the ice that I have .
And this <unk> then says that the neighbors are exactly the same .
It 's just a whole brain with other corals , and it is just acting for different individuals .
It becomes different from the coral , but it 's something that is more common .
We 've had the ability to understand the capabilities of quantum flu .
And quantum mechanics tend to express the patterns of the Internet .
It tells us that the reality of the world and the coral is also different .
It 's hard to understand the problem , because everyone is only experiencing a life of life .
This is a quirky phenomenon of <unk> <unk> and his cat .
<unk> is more like this .
And in this experiment , there 's a couple of things that you have in the <unk> , and the figments of <unk> matter , which is two or two things , might be <unk> or impossible or not .
If the particle happens , it <unk> <unk> , and it 's dead .
But in other ways , it 's possible to fall out of the other .
Each individual is only experiencing one .
Another possibility is that it does n't exist .
It seems very strange because we feel that it 's not the opposite of itself .
We do n't like the coral reefs in different situations .
And that quantum mechanics tells us that this is the laws of the <unk> .
And by the way , <unk> is all happening .
This is the <unk> .
But it does n't mean anything .
And other directions of physics , which describes what happens .
<unk> tells us that everything is the interaction of <unk> and <unk> to explain .
There 's only one way to do it with these interactions .
Now I 'm going to tell you about what we know about these particles , how they operate .
In this device , the <unk> protons are accelerating , accelerating the speed of speed and speed speed , and then <unk> , forming a huge amount of energy energy .
And these are very quick , divided into the <unk> of the electromagnetic form and the computers that will be <unk> for their nature .
This is a huge machine in <unk> , in Geneva , the <unk> of the Large Hadron Collider , and it 's equivalent to the five times the amount of energy that is in the U.S. power control .
And what we do is we ca n't predict what particle particles will produce every day .
And quantum mechanics tells us everything .
But the physics does n't tell us what particle is .
These are the quality and quality of the particles and the energy that have to engage with protons and <unk> .
Any quality of any quality is not going to appear , so we wo n't see it .
And this new particle accelerator is <unk> .
It 's about seven times the amount of energy that 's happened , so we 'll see the new particles .
And before I talked about it , I 'll tell you about the <unk> particle .
They can build <unk> .
Most people know the electrons .
There 's a lot of work with you in the audience .
The creator has a trained employee called neutrinos , no quality , high quality .
And yet , it 's a huge amount of antibiotics and oxygen quality of the antibiotics that get all these protons in the body .
These particles are divided into <unk> and <unk> , and they 're all filled with toes .
These are familiar particles and <unk> , and our <unk> are the same as the first ones , but a lot of the quality .
The particles are interacting by the fundamental forces .
The electromagnetic force passes through photons and <unk> .
And there 's a very weak force that 's very faint , and it 's called " <unk> , " only by <unk> .
And the quarks are <unk> by the <unk> , and the three - second <unk> are used by the <unk> , three red blue whales .
This is the wrong word of <unk> , which is his <unk> .
And then finally , gravity is moving through the quality and shape of the object .
The most important thing is that every force is different .
Four forces are taken through their own particles and stuff .
There is a one that we do n't have , but it 's not sure that there 's a particle particle called <unk> particles that make all the particles .
The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is figuring out how to do that .
But the biggest truth is that we can see what we 're seeing .
And I 'm going to show you the best blueprint for you .
Now , if we use different kinds of particles and <unk> , all possible particles have been <unk> .
It 's overwhelming .
Nature has a lot of fun .
But if we 're going to stack them up with some beautiful patterns .
Our most important <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> have a <unk> , and quarks have one <unk> <unk> .
So by two active and a next second , antibiotics have a <unk> protons .
<unk> are also <unk> <unk> .
And we found that electric charges actually are the other two combinations of <unk> and weak <unk> .
If we stack the <unk> and the weak <unk> of the two - dimensional space , it 's covered with particles of particles , and they 're embedded in these particles .
The electromagnetic effects associated with the <unk> and the weak <unk> , it 's a pattern that creates this pattern .
We call this <unk> model in 1967 .
And because of the particles of <unk> particles , we do n't know about ice and weak <unk> .
The <unk> particles on the left have a lot of <unk> symmetry .
And through a larger quality of quality , it 's more <unk> .
Because there 's a lot of <unk> that vary in the side of the brain , and it does n't have a quality of it , but there is no quality and the spray associated with leopard seals .
So the electromagnetic effects associated in this two - dimensional space , through the forms of particle , it describes it .
We can do that in the direction of two and two <unk> , and then we 're going to use the <unk> form of oxygen , which is the same two directions .
All of the <unk> particles can come up in four <unk> , and then the projection comes up for two space , so we can see it .
And no matter how the particles respond to the four or four feet away .
One particle , if you have a particle and you 're going to have energy , four watts of electric charges are going to vary by zero .
And so this is the same thing as if you go to the end of the day , with less than zero or less .
For example , this <unk> and its <unk> can generate in collision .
And then the interaction of interactivity has to stay stable .
A <unk> can become a electron and an anti - <unk> , and those three are <unk> .
Nature always keeps perfect balance .
So these seals are n't just beautiful .
And what you 're telling us is the interaction of the rules .
And if you rotate in four , the <unk> space , which is very mesh - y , is the interaction of the beautiful <unk> of this beautiful symmetry .
At the bottom of the Large Hadron Collider , it looks like this <unk> antibiotic , such as this green disaster , which allows antibiotics to bring antibiotics from different kinds of <unk> .
The strong effects will be <unk> in every single amount of atoms that we have in our bodies to keep the nucleus itself .
But with three <unk> of <unk> , it 's not the arrival of the end .
We can also use these two <unk> of gravity .
And then each dot has a <unk> , and every particle goes down and down , and there are two <unk> of <unk> .
If you separate them up in the <unk> , it 's a beautiful pattern .
In six circles , the pattern is spinning , and we 'll find it very beautiful .
This pattern is a pattern that allows us to know that the particles in the world are completely drawn into the particles .
And that 's what we 're sure .
Some of the particles in the experiment are hard to see .
From this pattern , we 've learned that the particles of the <unk> are the ones that are very beautiful in the world , and the pattern is very beautiful in this room .
I want to talk about some of the <unk> of <unk> .
And we <unk> this pattern , and we can expand to look at the <unk> .
We want to find all the different particles of the universe .
And then , at the end of the process , it 's predicted to test new particles in this pattern .
<unk> physics , the old idea of <unk> , thinks that this non - <unk> pattern comes from a more perfect pattern .
So we 're going to have new forces that have a new <unk> .
At the same time , we 're trying to predict the particles in this direction , and when you 're going to make it <unk> , you can rotate it with other particles .
And if you think about it , we can build standard standard of standards in space , as much as the magic model of <unk> space .
This particle is a way of <unk> and <unk> in 1973 , and it 's an exploration of the Big Bang .
And when we see this new type of alternative patterns , there are some spaces that should have particles that exist .
This is the study of a unified theory .
Physicist physicists are going to have the structure of the <unk> to explore more symmetry .
This is a larger structure that allows us to predict the fact that they have n't been observed .
And this unity model is that these two <unk> particles are very similar to the <unk> , but it does n't make any sense .
Now you can see that in seven circles , it 's also about thinking about this kind of weird phenomenon about particle <unk> : <unk> in <unk> , in the <unk> space , with the first <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
These particles are passed through six <unk> of <unk> .
They 're going to be separate in the standard room .
But in <unk> , in the <unk> space , we can <unk> each of these particles .
And then , in the <unk> space , you see what the whole pattern looks like .
And here we can see that <unk> <unk> and <unk> are through a <unk> symmetry and the first generation of <unk> .
This particular pattern in <unk> is one of the most beautiful geometry of mathematics .
This is the largest <unk> pattern <unk> .
The god is <unk> , and the god is Space .
And every single one of the patterns that you can find is that it 's a very complicated pattern .
And one of the students in <unk> can be used to describe Einstein 's general relativity , relativity .
This geometric shape and a quantum is able to describe everything in the smallest scale .
And in this pattern , the pattern in the <unk> region is very glamorous , and it 's also the same interaction that 's going to happen over half of these <unk> , which is a very complex shape .
And then you can see a lot of complex patterns in it .
And through some kind of swells - <unk> space , we can look at this pattern , looking at this pattern and see the pattern , and all the particles .
This is a beautiful structure and a <unk> theory , and we can see that there are a couple of filaments that require new particles in this pattern .
There 's a new amount of particles that need to be able to get the new particles into the two , which has been filled with <unk> and <unk> particles .
From the positions of the pattern , we know that these new particles and particles are embedded in <unk> particles , but they have <unk> and strong interactions .
And the new particles make the patterns that allow us to get the whole <unk> .
This <unk> pattern has <unk> mathematics .
It 's a lot of people who think it 's the most beautiful structure .
Some of the people who predict this will have an incredible mathematical structure that can be <unk> in the smallest size of what we can suppose .
And this mathematics describes nature 's theory is not just about it .
In <unk> , Galileo wrote , " Nature used to be written in front of us .
It 's made from <unk> circles and other geometric shapes , where we ca n't understand that there is no way that we 're going to lose them in darkness .
And I believe that this is real , I 've been trained by the <unk> of Galileo , and I 'm going to describe the mathematical shape of <unk> <unk> and other geometric shapes .
When I work with other physicists , math is like a dark <unk> .
But we 're sure the core of math is that simplicity is beautiful .
<unk> and quantum mechanics describes our universe as an <unk> coral , and in every place where the rays are going to vary in each other .
<unk> <unk> on the new <unk> of the Large Hadron Collider , and we can see that there 's also a pattern of pattern <unk> .
It 's an amazing exploration process .
If you 've found that particle patterns are cool .
And if you found a new particle , it was very interesting that it would be really interesting , but it was very interesting .
It 's a little bit harder for me .
So how big is that ?
Well , that 's pretty big .
But that 's exactly what Nature is doing .
This theory and other types of mind is in <unk> .
Even if there 's a lot of <unk> , it does n't necessarily have to be a natural truth .
It 's so commonplace that the Bible is so commonplace .
It does n't look like a new physical theory .
It 's a huge amount of money , and it 's always hard to get emotional experience .
But in science , if you do n't get rid of it , try something else .
And in those non - <unk> , the only way to be able to keep happy is the way that happiness is in life .
I 've been moved to life as well as possible .
I 'm trying to find comfort in the physical love and the radar , my three <unk> direction .
And even if my physical research does n't feel good , I still have a good life .
I tried to live in <unk> .
Most of my time in the last decade , I live in a very glamorous place .
Now my biggest definition of my parents is how I do n't live at a time of time .
I want to tell you this secret .
This is picture of my family offices on the island of <unk> .
These are all .
And you may notice that these pictures are similar , but the background is slightly different .
Because this was me at home and offices .
I picked a really cool life .
Do n't worry about what I spend time to do .
<unk> 's life , sometimes , is very difficult , and so I can be able to live in the beautiful place of life .
I could spend a lot of time on the <unk> of <unk> .
And I 'm also happy to engage with very smart people .
It 's great to be invited to speak here .
Thank you .
I think I just did n't know about two percent , but I 'm absolutely sure that it 's not glamorous .
All of your life ... I like to call the coral theory .
Well , it makes people excited because if you 're right , then you make gravity and quantum theory .
So you do n't say we need to understand that the most subtle stuff in the universe might be the <unk> model ?
I mean , do you have a special size size , or Einstein ?
Well , just to show you the pattern of patterns that we know physics , it 's already a beautiful pattern .
That 's where I say we 're very sure .
And the shape of this shape is obviously the equivalent of the <unk> , almost as close to the image .
And I 'm going to show you these <unk> patterns that are represented by <unk> objects , and these patterns are in the air , the <unk> , the clouds and the dance .
And this explains what we see .
Chris : But my understanding of string <unk> will explain a little bit more <unk> in a smaller string -- I know you do n't like it .
But how do we understand the electron in the <unk> model ?
JH : No , it will be part of the <unk> symmetry .
So , in fact , when this shape hits the sky , it will bend into the <unk> , and it 's <unk> the shape of the particles that we see . So what is the size of a electron <unk> ?
I have a little bit of that .
Will it be larger or less ?
Well , we know the electrons are a little particle , so this will let us see the smallest size .
So in <unk> , these things are all the possibilities of all sorts of possibilities .
This is why I have an analogy for the corals .
Because this is something that goes into the way that the air is connected to each other .
And also , what I 'm saying is that the shape of shape comes through the surface of the curve , and it 's a <unk> way of <unk> them .
So , according to <unk> , they put it into the same and interactive .
I do n't know how to explain it .
Chris : Yeah .
It 's <unk> our interest . I 'm sure I want to know more about it .
Thank you very much for home . Your speeches are attracted .

Good afternoon , good evening .
Or we can also say , <unk> , goodbye , wait , or ...
And that 's when the chimps sleep at night .
You hear this call from the Ross Ice Sheet , from a group of hosts to other chimps .
I want to start with the topic of <unk> <unk> in <unk> tonight .
And what he talked about is this amazing <unk> <unk> , called <unk> .
We 've heard about the history of human beings in the beginning of the DNA gene .
The old <unk> <unk> is <unk> me from the bush .
It 's a very cool path .
Now , it 's much more regular than his argument , because he 's looking for a early origin of human species .
These are the shapes , from the shape of the <unk> muscle , as well as the species of people who seem to be able to figure out how to find the original tools that they 've seen from their lives .
But what do they do ? This is what he wants to know .
Of course , behavior does n't exist in the fossil .
And if we 've found that the best species in the world are similar to the other kinds of human behavior , or the same way , maybe it 's going to happen in a hundred thousand years ago , that 's probably about the ancestor of a ancestor .
So maybe those behaviors are from <unk> .
<unk> : Well , if you look at the book of evolution , it will often find that people are based on the way human beings think about human behavior .
And they 're more than the other ones that we 've heard in the conference , and I hear this conference in the TED conference .
So what I want to talk about today is the <unk> of the chimpanzees and the same way that the human race is in the way .
Everybody has his own personality .
And of course , I gave them names . They 've lived 60 or longer , even though we think of most of them in the yellow environment .
This is <unk> chimps , <unk> Jacques on 11 or 12 .
And every five or seven years , every six or six years old , she had a lot of resistance , and she needed to take care of the night and to sleep with her mother .
We think that this is very important for the chimpanzees , and it 's about learning , as childhood accidents .
In all sorts of different forms of evolution , because the brain has become more complex , we found that it 's more important to learn in a human life .
The average chimps spend a long time looking at what their friends do .
And we know that they can copy the <unk> .
And we think that it 's a different behavior that comes from all sorts of different kinds of people in Africa , and how they 're looking at how to look at and <unk> , to <unk> and act from the generation , so we can use these tools to connect with the other generation of tools .
The chimps did n't have language , we mentioned .
But they do have a whole very rich gesture and a lot of action , and so many of us are like , even though , the chimpanzee contracts .
They also also kiss , they 've got another return .
They do n't want to be <unk> or <unk> .
In social societies , we found lots of parties , <unk> and real examples .
And indeed , unfortunately , they also have the opposite of nature .
They could get sick , even like a <unk> war .
In most cases , these are very glamorous behavior that are directly dependent on seasons .
These are all sorts of attacks for dealing with motion .
And I think , with other primates , the other group of people who have learned that humans and animals are not <unk> .
And this <unk> is very <unk> , and it 's a lot more <unk> .
And I started doing research in 1960 .
These chimpanzees , the most complex social lives in the wild , and what they do is they help us understand , we do n't have a <unk> animal on the Earth .
So , you know , there 's a lot of other creatures that are missing in the chimpanzees and the world , and it 's very , very <unk> , and it 's <unk> .
This is just one photo from the sky , and you can see the <unk> of the forest paste .
So , 16 years ago , I went across the entire area of the town , and this forest was n't really bad at the <unk> in 1960 , but only 30 square square miles per square meter -- and there was a question to me -- a problem that came into me .
" How can we get to trying to save the chimpanzees in the state of the country , and they 're struggling with the people around the world ? "
There were no <unk> , non - <unk> .
As you 've seen from <unk> <unk> , people who have come from Congo , they 're going to increase the population .
These people are very poor -- <unk> from other places .
And a plan is , we call it " love . "
It 's going to depend on the lives of people who live in the ice with the rest of the village .
The first is small . There 's 12 villages . It 's 24 villages now .
There is no time to go and introduce you , but it 's a way to do something like <unk> <unk> , and the way that we 're going to die at the bottom of the mountain , in this case , <unk> desert .
control , <unk> , prevent land .
And the way that <unk> used to be <unk> in <unk> , two years of <unk> , could be <unk> .
<unk> is made of freshwater .
And maybe we 're building some <unk> .
And I think the most important thing is that there 's a lot of <unk> with small groups of women and women .
In the world , in all of the police , we 've got about 30,000 feet .
<unk> women to work in education , to get them to learn a little bit better about schooling , and the world population population rate is going to die .
We consume information and HIV / AIDS .
And this is something that happens after this project .
And what 's happening is that the farmers in the world are born in this 24 villages , and it 's not going to be taken into the whole <unk> of the brain , saying , well , there 's a lot of workers who are trying to say , " <unk> <unk> , when we start to go to the village , it is an Tanzania group .
Contrary to <unk> , a church group asked about what was interested in .
Are they interested in the natural conservation ?
They 're interested in health , they are interested on education .
As soon as the Grand Canyon , as they start changing , they started trying to understand more about natural conservation .
They 're starting to understand that the number of people in the mountains are <unk> , and the terrible land is <unk> and <unk> .
Now , we 're developing the big <unk> ecosystem .
This is the place where the city park outside the street , including all sorts of <unk> of land .
And because these are the big ones that live in this village , they actually agree with 10 or 20 percent of their land in the <unk> , and then there 's the chimpanzees coming back to the other side of the brain , where they 're going to be able to go back into the way that they are <unk> -- and that 's how they have to <unk> and interact with other people .
So , " <unk> success . "
We copy for the rest of the world in other areas of <unk> <unk> .
But as all as we start talking about all of the problems in the TED conference , the problem is major problems .
That 's very poor .
There 's a large amount of people who live in the land , especially when you put the tree out of the soil , and you 're going to get a lot of trees and get more and more of it , it 's more <unk> .
There 's other questions -- not only in Africa , but in other forms , all of us are doing everything on Earth ?
The famous scientist , Dr. Oscar Wilson , said that , if everybody on Earth 's life , we need three planets .
I mean , they 're four . But we do n't have one , we have one .
What happened ? I mean , here 's the problem here , which is , we might probably call the most powerful life on Earth .
And all of the peoples around the world are trying to sit together and say , " Well , how do you respond to the people next ? "
Today , important decision -- I do n't talk about Africa , but the world 's world -- still , and a million people , is just saying , " How do that impact the next generation ? "
These decisions are affected Africa .
When I started to unveil the problem with the chimpanzees , and further <unk> , I was inundated with deforestation , which I realized that so many of these problems was how many African problems were evolving .
So I started traveling in Africa , and I was speaking in Europe , to the U.S.
These are bad questions .
You know what I mean , it 's <unk> problems .
And the air that we breathe is often poisoning us .
<unk> are poisoning our food .
Water , water , might be one of the most important problems that we 're going to confront in the world , and the water is stored in agriculture , industrial , home , family , <unk> and <unk> .
The sea is affected by the tsunami and the influence of the tsunami .
We talk about <unk> .
And we 've seen other things about the fossil fuels , which is called greenhouse gas .
And finally , people around the world are starting to think about what happens .
Global climate change .
The most powerful effect is the poor .
What 's affected is Africa .
In sub - Saharan Africa , the drought is very serious .
And the last thing that 's <unk> is that the <unk> are <unk> and more <unk> , poverty , starvation and disease .
There are lots of people who live in land in the land , and they do n't have any food , because all the continents are all left , so it ca n't leave it .
So there 's a little bit of <unk> -- little <unk> , <unk> - <unk> .
This is not just Africa that is spreading across Africa .
So I do n't think so much like a lot of young people around the world when I travel around the world .
It seems that we have lost wisdom , the wisdom of the individual .
And I ask , why ?
Do you think that this is a very clever brain in this particular brain , as a human brain and the human spirit , to talk about love and compassion .
And these young people , when I speak to them , they do n't have either <unk> or hurt or pain or anger , and they say , " We feel that you feel like you lose our future and we ca n't . "
We have already destroyed their future .
And I have three and three years old , and every time I look at them , I think , from me , how they 're going to fix this beautiful planet .
We came up with this project , and we called it " <unk> , " and Tanzania now are spreading around the world today .
The name of the project is <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> looked very small in the sun .
You can think of the environmental and social problems that we give the planet to the Earth .
Hundreds of young people around the world are able to get some breakthroughs , to make the world better .
The most important message is , every single day , we 're changing the world every day .
We have a choice that we have every single person in the room , and we all have one choice , what we want to do .
People do n't choose to change these things , and we have the choice .
" <unk> " is a group of three things .
And depending on the age of the <unk> , the country is in the city , and it 's different from the city .
In fact , we 're starting to start building a lot of adults from the University of <unk> , where they start to build their own " <unk> . "
And each of these groups , three different ways , to create a better world , is that all these different questions are <unk> each other .
And so one of their solutions is to help their own human community .
And then , if they do what they 're doing , they can fix the world in other areas .
One of the solutions they do is to help animals -- not just wildlife , but also the animal kingdom .
One of the things that they 're going to do is help the <unk> of our <unk> .
And the message that <unk> in all of these ideas is to learn to ourselves and family , community and community , different cultures , cultures between us and the world , and with our natural world .
We need natural world , and we ca n't continue to save the world now .
We have only one planet .
And in Africa , it 's only about trying to pick a or two , two - or - a - half member of what 's going to be done , if you 're in Australia , in Tanzania , South Asia , Thailand , Indonesia , North Korea , <unk> and other groups .
And of course , they 're <unk> , they 're organic blood vessels .
They sell chicken eggs in the <unk> , and they 're just going to feed the eggs or it 's just <unk> snakes to families and feel proud , because they grow their own food care because it does n't depend on other people .
This is a scheme for some of the things that we 've done in Uganda .
They make them <unk> .
Again , they become social values .
We 've done it in prison .
So it 's not time to do a lot of <unk> .
Well , they also work on HIV and density .
That 's an important part of the project , which is very important for kids to talk to kids .
<unk> are also pregnant and similar as young people to hear other kids rather than adults .
Hopefully , I 've asked the question that the world is asked by this question , " <unk> , you 've seen so many horrible things that you 're looking at , and you can see the number of people who are getting less than 15 and a half million .
The deforestation , the place where the forests are the desert .
You really have hope ? " Well , yes .
You do n't want to have meetings like TED , right ?
Well , of course , there is hope . One is the magic .
I mean , think about technology .
I was thrilled , and I met people talking about the logging toilets .
This is one of my favorites .
We 're going to put all these <unk> under the <unk> .
And then we talked about energy , very important .
Will we care about the Earth ?
How many kids are the ones who are <unk> or <unk> and <unk> ?
Do we care about them ?
If you care about their future , as the global chaos , we can do it every day .
What do you buy ?
How do you make these choices so that you can influence the environment around me ?
How did this happen , and how would that affect his life or her life ?
Or my grandchildren , or whatever .
So the brain , with the people -- our global <unk> .
That 's the question of TED , and it 's about Google helping us to make maps of <unk> National Park .
All of that we are .
Now let 's do it , it 's going to happen , right ?
And afternoon , you 've heard about it . It 's going to happen .
This change is changing ; it 's going to see the change we have , if we care about the future .
The next reason is that the power of natural nature is terrific .
You can find a place where the <unk> is <unk> -- and there 's some help , and that area will <unk> .
One example is " <unk> Project . "
And I tell you , in a piece of looking at the dead -- if you stop trying to wake up , you do n't need to check , because you have a <unk> tree for five years .
Every animal , almost extinct . That 's what I 'm next to the next book .
It 's encouraging . It brings me to the last two days , and we 've heard so much about the human spirit , the <unk> of human beings , people who are <unk> , so you think you 're going to get out of poverty and disease , or something that helps to engage the world and engage a world of social change , where they have access to <unk> .
As long as you think about the real , two people in Africa .
And we can use a long list of lists , and Nelson Mandela came out of the 17 year - old age , 23 years of <unk> , to prevent his country , so that he could lead his nation to the evil of apartheid .
Ken <unk> -- <unk> , in Nigeria , with the high - intensity <unk> of oil , despite all the people around the world .
So people are very excited about this .
People are what we need to think about Africa .
We also need some environmental models of what I 've heard today .
So I 've got a chance to share these things again and share with each other .
I hope that part of us can unite through these things especially , especially " <unk> Project . "
Now , finally , the last thing -- the young girl in the center of the conference , I had to meet her today .
She was very excited about her , and she got her <unk> . She was involved .
She 's in <unk> in Australia .
She said she can do it now .
And I 'm very , very excited about this , and this is just an example : when young people are empowered to make the opportunity to achieve the world to action , they really have the hopes that we want tomorrow .
Thank you .

<unk> Cohen shares the fact that the <unk> of plastic pollution and some ideas of our lives and our daily lives , helps us to get rid of the plastic room .

<unk> Cohen : A serious fact about plastic pollution
I 'm an optical artist , and it 's one of the founder of <unk> pollution .
Over the last 20 years , I 've been involved in plastic glasses , and I 'm <unk> raw material and <unk> plastic .
<unk> plastic and <unk> art , sculptures and art installations .
And after eight years of work , some of my paintings started <unk> a lot of little plastic coat <unk> .
I thought , " Awesome . "
The plastic is like us . "
I was taught to be able to understand the plastic , and I learned that plastic is a bad material .
There are lots of little coat <unk> , but it 's a cruel , terrible thing .
We found a lot of plastic floating .
But in the last few years , I know that the Pacific Garbage seals are burning .
And my first response -- I think that 's the first thing that most people do , and I said , " Oh , my God ! "
We need to go there and lose these plastic . "
So I proposed a cow , two <unk> <unk> , a <unk> and a cold , an extremely cold hill .
And I 'm planning to go through the junk to get rid of the garbage , and to raise the <unk> of this pollution , starting to avoid plastic , filling it into a little little <unk> , but it 's going to be used as a <unk> .
These are people who come to the landfill , and people say , well , they 've been working on plastic pollution to <unk> pollution , talking about the destruction of the ocean , so I 've got to realize that the oceans are going to lose plastic every day , as I have to think about it .
The real solution is , we need to be able to figure out how to do it .
We need to cut out the production of plastic with plastic and <unk> plastic , allowing them to go into the ocean every day .
And look at this , I know I 'm very upset .
And I 'm not just concerned about what 's going on in the middle of the Pacific , and the authority data is , 11 junk leopard <unk> goes through the world .
I 'm not just interested in plastic , but it 's also <unk> , and also the plastic of the supermarket .
I 'm going to go to the mall , everything 's <unk> .
All the <unk> are <unk> , even health markets .
And I also focused on the plastic of the <unk> , and also the skeleton of plastic and <unk> that we ate and absorb our bodies .
And I have a whole bunch of other people who are concerned about this plastic pollution , which is built by the plastic pollution .
We have a lot of activity for dealing with this problem , and some of them are very simple .
One of them is , in the sea , we found that 80 percent of the <unk> is plastic , and why do n't we make it ?
<unk> pollution .
<unk> is a story about sustainability and <unk> .
You 've never seen anything to it , but never before .
What is the reality ?
In the United States , the plastic clean is less than 70 percent .
You want to look at it , especially when the plastic becomes <unk> , most of the bottle is swallowed by recycled , or <unk> , or to China .
When a leopard can make a bottle , or <unk> , it 's been killed , made blood paste , allowing them to be made out of little plastic , so that a plastic bottle does n't kill .
For us , this is a problem .
And what we 're looking at is the other thing that people think , in the three - <unk> principle , is <unk> and <unk> , and the fourth thing is , it 's <unk> by <unk> .
Whenever <unk> <unk> use plastic using plastic and <unk> plastic .
<unk> use . Some of them are very glamorous .
I 'm collecting these cool <unk> of glass , using these fantastic <unk> , use that joy and <unk> <unk> to store food .
I know that I do something about me and my family .
We 're going to use stainless glasses and glue , and if you want to go out and remember the stainless King , let 's remember that the crust , or the water , do n't buy the water .
I think what I want to tell you about is that you know you have a lot of plastic in the ocean , and it 's a huge problem , but this is a problem we do for consumers , but it 's a problem that we do .
We 're looking at the perception of the problem , to teach people to replace <unk> .
So , whenever you choose to use the use of alternative goods , reject <unk> using plastic and <unk> plastic .
We can cut out the <unk> , prevent this plastic pollution to our ocean , save our oceans , saving our homes and save ourselves .
Thank you .

This shows -- from the MIT Lab at MIT , from <unk> demos -- in the TED Prize . This is a <unk> device for us to interact with our environment . Think about the <unk> .
demo , entertainment , interface design , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> demos " <unk> , <unk> technology
There 's a problem that I think is quite a long time , which is that we evolved a little bit of a <unk> that allows us to get out of the <unk> , or some other information , where we need to make some decisions .
And you might say , well , what 's your cellphone ?
But I do n't think .
So imagine , when you meet somebody in TED , TED -- no , it 's a great social endeavor , and you do n't want to raise your hand and say , " You can wait for a moment ? "
Or , when you 're in the supermarket , you stand in a big <unk> , and you face all sorts of <unk> and do you take the mobile phone and open the browser and try to decide where the browser is , and try to decide what it is that is the most <unk> ?
So we do n't have a <unk> drive to get these information , and those can help us decide what to do .
So in my lab , I 've done a whole series of inventions on the conditions that do n't change the user behavior , and to help users quickly , and that information is very short for these information .
Now , I 'm going to show you this device , which is the most successful version of the way we 've ever seen it .
And I 'm now on the verge of <unk> , which is a few components of the market , and the cost of it is 350 dollars in the process .
And I <unk> a camera , which is a simple network of Internet glasses , a <unk> for batteries and a small mirror .
These are the components of the mobile phone in my pocket , as an communication device .
In the image , it 's my <unk> student , and he designed and created this whole system .
And we can see that when he gets closer , information will be <unk> on the surface , he uses his hands to operate .
The system will follow four main fingers .
And here , you can see that he 's wearing glue .
If you want more beauty , you can make a different color .
And the camera is going to show you the four finger , notice his hand , for example , he can open up the map , and it 's going to zoom in and zoom or zoom in and run .
This system can recognize " Window gesture , " for example , when you make this " <unk> " system , the system is <unk> you .
And when he returned back to the Media Lab , he could go to any wall of the wall , <unk> all the photos , with all sorts of natural purposes , to <unk> , change the size of all kinds of things , and all of a sudden all sorts of uses to do it . All of these things are used to work with the purpose of <unk> , all the way up to doing it , to make all kinds of things work on the path to finish the hand . "
Some of you were here two years ago to see the <unk> - <unk> system of Microsoft , and you might think that this system looks like this .
Yeah , this <unk> system is <unk> with natural purposes , using both hands .
But the difference is , I can use this system to operate on any surface , if you 're not able to use the surface of anything to interact with your hand .
The use of this device is completely limited , and it can be used for ...
So , the important difference is , I 'm totally <unk> about this system .
The other thing that 's more important is that this device will not be much more cooler than the phones that I 'm wearing today , and it 's going to be more beautiful than I currently have now .
This device is a device that makes you look at reality , and you 're looking at the beauty of the <unk> script , which is really important , but it really does n't need to be an <unk> in front of anything .
We see <unk> now , and he 's going to get to the mall .
When he took a <unk> , the system would be <unk> by <unk> or <unk> and then showing a switch , or the <unk> lights .
He can get more information .
So this choice , according to his personal standards , is a best option .
Some of you might want to have the most <unk> <unk> , rather than the healthiest <unk> .
And when he took a book on the bookstore , he would have a Amazon.com website for this book to the cover of the book .
This is the title of the audience who was excited before the Amazon <unk> .
And then , when <unk> jumps off this book , there 's a lot more information about that book -- the readers literature , his favorite author , and so on .
And if he was approaching something particular , he would look at one of our friends in his friends , giving him some information about this page .
When you look at newspapers , it 's always the beginning .
You can see the story of the events of events , the most distant times of <unk> , and so on .
Next is a controversial function .
And when you meet someone , you 'll see a tag , and these tags come from this person , from the bloggers and <unk> .
In this case , we saw this student interested in a camera and so on .
And in the way you go to the airport , when you take your toes , it 's going to tell you that vacation is <unk> , and so on , so that 's the way you 're going to go through the <unk> .
Also , if you want to know about time , it 's very simple , in your arm .
And that 's the kind of <unk> that we 've developed now , and this allows us to raise the information , convenience our lives , help us better .
My ambition is <unk> .
I should get them all over the last three months .
His girlfriend was <unk> .
But this device is n't happening now .
In the next decade , our brain is embedded in <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> and Tim <unk> did the presence of <unk> , the son of September , November 1945 , in August of 2001 , his son was introduced to the <unk> of the past , and to try to figure out how to engage the peace , this two sister knows and other women .
culture , global issues , politics
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : Finding the <unk> for forgiveness .
<unk> <unk> : We 're here today because we 've got one of the most unusual aspects of it .
And it 's true .
Now , we 've got it .
I knew that my son was going to visit in November of September , 2001 .
We do n't know whether he 's alive when he is in Florida .
And I knew that this was political reasons .
We worry about the state of the country , and the thing that we 're going to do -- my husband , Zappos , and I and we are .
When I saw -- but the experience of this <unk> , the terrible <unk> of life , is that it 's a terrible life .
A few weeks later , <unk> <unk> is one of the leading winners of <unk> attacks , and the U.S. government is going to die for him , if <unk> and I have a different way of talking about this .
By the way , we came together with other victims of human rights .
When I saw it in media , her son was <unk> , I thought , " How brave women .
When I was more <unk> , I wanted to meet this woman . "
I still <unk> in grief , I know enough .
I know one day I can find her , maybe we 'll find each other .
Because when people hear my son are victims , I immediately have compassion .
But when people hear her son was <unk> , she did n't have compassion .
But she had the same pain with me .
So we met in November November , and I 'll tell you what happened to you .
<unk> : Good night , ladies and gentlemen .
I am a Mother of <unk> <unk> .
I asked the Human Genome Society to my parents .
And so they introduced me to five families .
When I met <unk> , I noticed her .
She is the only mother in the community .
They 're all brothers and sisters .
And when I saw her , she was a mother , and my mother .
As a mother , I had a lot of <unk> .
I was 14 .
And 15 years old , the first child loses the first child , 16 children .
So the thing for <unk> is that I really think so much .
I still am <unk> because my son is <unk> .
I learned that she had a son for her son .
But she knows where he 's .
My son , I did n't even know where he was .
I do n't know whether he was alive , I did n't know whether he was <unk> .
I do n't know what he 's doing .
And this is why I decided to tell my story , so my pain could have a good help for other women .
For all of the women , all the lives of all life , you can <unk> , you can change .
It depends on our women because we 're women , because we love our children .
We have to do something together .
It 's not for the women for women , for us , to for our women .
I am against violent violence against terrorists .
And I went to school and young Muslim girls , so they 're not going to accept the marriage of their marriages .
If I can save a young girl , it does n't care about them as much as I get married , and that 's a good thing .
That 's why I stand here in front of you .
<unk> : And what I want to say is that I 've learned a lot of people from the Grand Canyon , and we 're going to tell you a little bit about the rest of the family -- and this is a very <unk> party , because it 's in November , the Japanese <unk> -- the <unk> of our family .
But we 're all very nervous .
" Why do she bother us ? "
And she 's also nervous .
" Why do n't we get her ? "
What do we need to do with each other ?
And before we understand other people 's name and other things , we 're already crying together .
And then we <unk> with people in the midst of chaos and experience to help , help .
And she said , " I do n't know my son is <unk> or <unk> , but I want to tell you how to do something that 's happening in your family .
And I know that this is painful , and I think that if someone 's won , that person should be <unk> and <unk> . "
But she 's using this approach to our feelings , and this is , I think , a way of doing it .
And what happens is that we 've all talked about our story , and we 're going to interact with each other .
At the end of the afternoon -- three hours later -- we feel like we 've never seen each other .
And what I learned from her , as a woman , could change the way that she was going through , and she had the experience of her child and her kids lived .
From the different cultures of my experience and the environment , I never saw a tough struggle .
I think we have a special connection , a connection to me .
I think this is because of all of the interest between each other , but it 's going to realize " Ah , that 's not the hard thing .
I can also tell you some people I do n't know , or is it different ?
So , do you have a summary ?
Because we 're going to die .
<unk> : I want to say we 're going to try to understand others .
You 've got to become <unk> , and you have to have become something that you have to be alive .
You have to learn about forgiveness .
You have to fight with violence .
I hope that we 're going to live in peace with peace .
And that 's what I want to say .

There are <unk> people in the world who do n't get water . Engineer <unk> is doing something -- invent a lot of <unk> <unk> , which can do most of the problems of most water , and a beautiful demonstration from <unk> 2009 .
business , demo , design , global issues , invention , technology , water

<unk> Richard is going to become the opposite of the soul of the soul .
Good morning everybody .
I want to talk to you about <unk> .
The first is water .
I can see that you 're very excited about the water that comes from the conference , in the past few days .
And I 'm sure you 're all feeling that those are the ones that come out of a safe fresh water .
But what if it did n't ?
What if it did ?
The data will say you 're going to get half of you now .
I used to talk about data on data , and for all people .
But it does n't work .
But I think I 've found that .
Because , in terms of thinking , it seems overwhelming that we can fix it .
So we did n't want to have it . We do n't know . Governments , and HIV / AIDS .
Well , today , I 'm going to show you a little bit about a different approach to different ideas .
But by the way , it 's in my talk , and there are <unk> people in the world .
And four kids died .
I invented this <unk> bottle because I was really upset .
I , like most of you , in the <unk> of 2004 , sat down in June , and saw the catastrophic news news -- television in Asia .
And in the next few days , people were going to get rid of the hills , and they were forced to drink contaminated water , or otherwise it would be terrible .
And that makes me tick .
Next , a few months later , we 're flying across the coast of the States .
" Okay , I think , " Here 's the first world in the world , let 's see what they can do . "
One : nothing happened .
Next one : nothing does nothing .
And you know what they spent over five days to get water into New Orleans ?
People are in the streets and the water on the street .
At the time , I decided to do something .
And in the next few weeks and a few months , I spent a lot of time on my garage , and in my kitchen , it took me to see my wife .
But then , after some failures , I did this , and I made this <unk> <unk> .
Okay , now this is a piece of scientific background .
Before <unk> <unk> , the best <unk> filter can only filter 200 degrees centigrade .
The smallest bacterium has about 200 nanometers .
So a billion megatons of a bacterium can travel through this 200 <unk> .
Also , the smallest germ , roughly 25 nanometers .
So that would be the absolute <unk> of 200 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is only 15 nanometers .
So that 's okay .
Okay , I 'm going to show you a demo .
Do you want to see it ?
I 've spent a lot of time , so I think I should be a demo .
We 're in <unk> .
Oh , somebody had <unk> .
The good Oxford , what I did , I was doing <unk> <unk> , and I had the water inside of the river . That 's where I came up with water . And that 's where I came .
But I thought , you know , if we 're in <unk> <unk> , it does n't look like this .
So I came up with these things , and I did it .
This is from my ponds .
This is <unk> .
Okay , yeah .
We just throw it up .
Audience : <unk> !
<unk> : Okay , we 've got <unk> water from the streams of water .
We put it in .
<unk> , good .
And with these leopard <unk> , you get rid of it .
This is my friend 's sins , give me " <unk> . "
We put this in place .
Okay , now .
<unk> <unk> is very simple .
You <unk> the water .
And today , I 'm going to use a pencil to show you , let 's take a little flavor .
And that 's not enough to let us go .
Okay , I 'm going to put this out of the water , put it here . Can you think about this water ?
Okay , so .
That 's the top .
A little bit . Okay ?
This can be done .
Now , once I opened this bottle , it would come out of the water . I 'm going to get faster .
Okay , ready ?
That 's all . Notice the power .
This is safe , <unk> water .
Yves .
You try it . Chris .
How about that ?
Chris Anderson : <unk> .
<unk> : Okay .
Let 's see what 's going on here . OK ?
Okay . <unk> <unk> is used in the world .
It could be sold to seven <unk> .
And when it 's way of doing it , it uses a prescription remix , and the system is going to turn down , to protect the user .
Take a box box , a new one .
You can do it for 6,000 water .
Let 's look at the scope of this .
In a crisis , what do we do ?
We transport water water .
And then several weeks later , we rented refugee camp .
And the public would be forced to get to the refugee camp .
You think , when about 20,000 , what happens in a refugee camp ?
<unk> will spread , more resources .
The problem is that it 's self - <unk> .
But there 's a way to think about it , and it 's going to be able to get rid of the past .
They can make their own fresh water , and start <unk> their homes and life .
It does n't need a railway job .
To look at the problem , using a nation - to - a - nation infrastructure , and this is very expensive .
And you do n't have to use a helmet .
So , this can be seen in different ways .
We do n't have to transport water , and we 're going to do it with artificial drinking , to make the water . She 's got a fantastic system .
She took her water from here , free safety , Free transportation to another place , and then on the hill , the river and the Arctic left it .
There are all sorts of people who live there ? Close .
We 're just going to throw water out of the water .
So we can use <unk> bottles .
Or we can use this thing .
It uses the same technology , just to use this <unk> .
That 's 25 percent . That 's enough to keep a 40,000 , three - year - old .
So how much money need it ?
It 's about half a day .
Thank you .
So , from a different perspective , in the different ways of water , the mother and the kids do n't have to travel four hours a day to collect their water .
They can do it in the neighborhood .
This can be just about 80 billion dollars , so let 's achieve this <unk> goal , which makes no safety <unk> .
In contrast , the U.S. government spends a lot of AIDS for 80 million dollars .
But why ?
We can use 20 <unk> , allowing everyone to be safe .
And so the people who are suffering from this year , the annual two percent of the population of deaths , child survival , will continue to live .
Thank you .

In the <unk> talks , <unk> <unk> , when I think we live in the history of history , and he saw it <unk> the world of three major areas of the global world .
<unk> , global issues , politics , world cultures
<unk>
Yves <unk> : <unk> global power shifts
The RCA was written in a poet named an poet .
In <unk> , it was <unk> in <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> of this kind of <unk> seals , <unk> fluid , flows through the underside of the world , which is <unk> , and it 's a <unk> that 's worth <unk> .
To <unk> friends , this is the <unk> of <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
But what you 're hearing about is the same thing that you hear in the ' 50s , the 19th century , and then long , slowly , it 's going to end up in a terrible history of <unk> , where we will go into a horrible force cycle .
Ladies and gentlemen , this time is usually <unk> and <unk> .
My message to you is that I believe we have the same moment that we 've ever seen in history , when you meet the <unk> of power , and start changing the new forces of <unk> change .
These -- we know that there are very few <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> times in the ' 60s .
The <unk> is , it 's about a century .
You may not say that the last time you have time -- which is the European age of the <unk> and the Grand Canyon , the ancient state of Europe , which appears to be the American <unk> to the Atlantic , in the United States .
And of course , at the end of the Cold War , it appeared twice twice as well as the <unk> of Europe in Europe .
And he called it " <unk> " for Europe , but it 's still something .
Well , ladies and gentlemen , we live in this moment .
So for us , I 'm going to talk about three <unk> .
This is one of the first ones about power transition .
So , second second , I 'm calling it all the past .
Let 's talk about power transition .
It 's a little bit more glamorous today because it 's never happened .
We 've seen the <unk> of the power of power and power to move from the Greek to <unk> and Europe , but we see what 's going on .
Power is not <unk> in <unk> .
It 's moving around .
The power of today 's power transition today is much more powerful than the responsibility between the National constitution and the <unk> of the country .
<unk> politics , we talk about markets , but the reality is the power of power .
But the level of power in the state is the <unk> of law , which is different from the law .
Now , the power of the Internet and the world is , in fact , a huge amount of money , <unk> ownership of <unk> , and so on , it 's about a quarter - to - a - half - plus - <unk> currency of trade - demand , where you call the financial crisis , what they 're going to do is to <unk> the <unk> budget , which is far larger than the average <unk> .
It does n't spell <unk> in most of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It 's all about <unk> people now .
At the bottom of the helicopter , it 's never going to depend on the <unk> , but it does n't have a lot of <unk> in the future , not just in any place where you 're participating in what you want , the Internet , and so forth , you do n't want international <unk> ; the international contracts .
And 9/11 shows that even if you 're in the greatest state of the Earth , the most powerful city in Earth 's biggest city , at the same time , in this room , they can attack you .
It 's about 60 percent of the four percent reduction in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> events in 9/11 .
Look , our enemies are still going to use these spaces , and the Internet , as we do , to solve their resistance , so that it will destroy their resistance .
Our way of our system is that the laws of the <unk> are the power of power to go there .
And if this is true , then I believe that one of the things that 's going to be the dominant world is that the power of natural civilization is about globalization , right ?
And I think that the future of the world will have a different level of action , which will be able to make a difference that can make a difference .
To notice , I 'm not government .
It 's not the new democracy of the political company .
And ladies and gentlemen , <unk> is , I personally think that a lot of the United Nations is going to do something more like this .
If we do n't have that , we have to create a whole thing .
The world needs a <unk> international forum .
He went to <unk> International .
But when I look at the <unk> of globalization , I do n't have a lot of money .
And when the power of power is actually building a system of treaties , it 's a systematic operating system for the <unk> of <unk> .
You have to notice , you 'll see it 's happening , and slowly slowly .
The <unk> of the <unk> is the organization of treaties , and it 's a total force that 's worth <unk> , and his life is not worth the U.S.
Kyoto : effort trying to try and start a <unk> organization .
<unk> : Now we know that we 're going to collaborate with groups that are capable of handling a <unk> .
This is <unk> : A <unk> institution .
Now , the question is , we go back to the beginning of this , if you 're focused on the power of power to create a treaties that does n't go to <unk> space , and what do you do ?
That 's the big question back to the question .
So , my first point is that if you 're in the chaos of chaos , whether it 's less than a chaos to get rid of it , we 're going to have a lot of <unk> to manage the ability to manage it .
It 's <unk> it .
My second point is that I know I do n't have to tell you what it is , but the power is not moving , but it 's also <unk> .
And maybe you 're going to come from the culture of the civilization , and I think it is one of the leading forces of Western Europe , which is the Western community where the West is traveling across the Atlantic Ocean .
This is what I look like , I think , is that we 're seeing the most important power transition moving across the Atlantic , from the Atlantic Ocean .
Now , first of all , the economic growth is usually the beginning of the first time .
You 've seen the rest of the world that are emerging in the developing world .
And I think that 's not just the West , and it 's something different from East Europe .
And I realized that 10 years from the future , 15 percent of the world is still the most powerful country on Earth , but he does n't live in the background .
And the most important year in the history of 50 years of all the world 's history is that all of the strategies that are going to be <unk> or against the World Peace Organization , it 's going to be a nation - <unk> .
This is not uncommon in history .
In fact , what 's happening is the history of history .
You start seeing the <unk> .
Go to the world 's leading role of the United States .
In the future , he 's the most powerful source of powers , and it 's going to be <unk> in the world .
You start seeing other power centers , and of course , one of the things that happens to China is that the rise of China are not going to make it opposite .
It 's going to happen after the economy .
But this is another problem .
You see India , Brazil .
You see the world as well as the Europe of Europe in Europe .
<unk> <unk> is frequently known as the Europe of Europe , the European World Peace Game .
It has a <unk> balance .
In the U.K.
In Paris , U.K. and Berlin combined , England came to the other <unk> and <unk> .
Now , notice that when the world happens , it arises in a <unk> empire , like <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> power is a remix .
The power of <unk> , which is the currency , is going to change and change and change .
And this is the world that we 're going to go into , and we 'll see that we 'll see <unk> <unk> .
In the United States , the West said , " British <unk> has <unk> . "
You 're going to see that , as we do n't see the West , if we want to do the best of the world , then we 're trying to <unk> the Atlantic Ocean , or other countries .
When you go into Libya , you need to look at the Western state , and we 're going to engage with other countries .
We need to be <unk> .
And I think Iran is going to be the last time that Afghanistan and Afghanistan are trying to understand the last time , but without success .
I found that we 've got 400 years of <unk> <unk> , and I said 400,000 years , because it means that the West is Western and Western values .
You know , as far as possible , if the West can achieve it , it can be done on Earth .
But that 's not going to happen .
And the West was united after the West .
Yves seals , the World Bank , <unk> together , managed to solve the problem with <unk> .
Now we 're going to talk to other countries .
We 're going to create <unk> .
We 're going to depend on the Western empires .
So let me give you a projection , which is surprising .
And I suspect we 've got 400 years of <unk> , and when the West is <unk> .
People say , " China , of course , they do n't join peace to fight peace , all around the world .
<unk> ? Why ?
How many of the Chinese budgets today are in blue and blue , and how many people in the <unk> are on the top of the United Nations .
37
America ? Eleven .
That 's the largest amount of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> region in <unk> .
It 's a Chinese flag .
And of course , it 's the Chinese , of course , values .
It keeps going on the ocean .
In fact , we have to engage with some kind of values , but in <unk> , people who are interested in it .
This is a new way of looking at emerging worlds .
Next , third different approach .
Our modern world today , because the Internet is because people talk about all sorts of things .
People depend on each other .
<unk> to each other as the nation , the individual , in a manner .
<unk> relationships , it always exists .
<unk> is the foundation of the <unk> states .
But now we 're stuck together .
You 've got 24 hours later in Mexico , and it becomes a problem of <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> Brothers Brothers calling the whole economy .
And the <unk> <unk> came up with food in Africa .
Now , everybody 's got <unk> .
So what this means is that a nation - <unk> does n't interact with people who do n't relate to people .
Because , in fact , a state of action does n't have to be able to control it or whether they have enough capacity to controls his <unk> , because the influence of spreading is affecting the country .
When I was young , I had been trained by the last little <unk> .
At the time , this one was only focused on one thing , which was our <unk> <unk> , our Air Force -- our military <unk> and our collaborators .
That 's the enemies in the ' 80s .
Today , enemies are not in the wall .
Now , if I want to talk about policy , I 'm going to tell you , because the threat threat is , the security threat of our security is to say , " Well , <unk> threatens threat , when we 're vulnerable to the <unk> of the world , and I think we have a lot of technology in the web , it 's a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> in our country .
<unk> security is n't just military and <unk> .
It keeps all sorts of platforms .
It tells you some very important things .
In fact , it tells you that the <unk> of our government is the economic model of the Industrial Revolution , the economy of <unk> , and then the structure of a <unk> is already completely irrelevant .
You know , ladies and gentlemen , the structures of women , are the Internet patterns .
In the government , the ability to engineer the power of collaborative <unk> .
That 's where I get to the third laws .
<unk> said , do n't ask me to go back to the first law , because I did n't have the third laws , right ?
And when it comes to the third laws , it 's the most important thing you can do with each other , and what you do is , what do you do ?
It does n't matter whether you 're a government , or a <unk> - or - business model , which is your <unk> , your interior and your ability to connect with other people .
You 've learned this from work , but governments do n't know .
Next thing .
And if you do that , ladies and gentlemen , we 're in a way that we 've never seen this kind of thing .
And all of a sudden , the first time to think about collective <unk> is that the state of collective security is no longer enough .
In the past , if my country is safe , we are safe if ours is in other countries , and we 're safe .
It 's not the case .
As a mixture of connections and a large amount of military effects , which means that I 'm facing the same situation .
When I was seven years old in Geneva , we worked with the Soviet Union , because we understood that we found ourselves with them on the same sky sky .
The collective security is n't enough .
In Northern Ireland , you can see that there are zero and playing games .
They do the same with enemies .
In part of the Middle East , I think it 's the Israeli between Israel and Palestinian personnel .
Ladies and gentlemen , all of the poet who are very concerned about social happiness or <unk> , they all suggest that we have to seriously fulfill policy problem .
I started a poem , and I 'll end in a spell .
John <unk> on great <unk>
<unk> is " No . "
This is what it does .
Everyone 's got a lot of money for everybody who 's <unk> , and I 'm going to ask you for the rest of the year , and I 'm going to ask you , " <unk> <unk> for <unk> . "
John Hockenberry : A moral sponsors
I think it 's just a part of the equation .
Thank you .
<unk>
And for looking for the information , <unk> <unk> and his research team is called " <unk> , " and in these special places , older people live in the age of a lot of life , and the <unk> is still increasing .
biology , culture , exploration , food , health , life , science
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : How to vary
A research named " <unk> " research reveals the life of the <unk> in biology , which is only 10 percent of our genes .
The other 90 percent depends on our lives .
So , for <unk> studies : if we could find the best of life , we can get a real long <unk> .
But if you look at the average American , the best equation is , they 're probably going to do it .
They might have heard of diet <unk> , or <unk> diet .
You 've seen the <unk> food pyramid .
That would be the case .
Dr. <unk> would say <unk> .
But what we 're really surprised to do is actually make us more likely .
Are you running out of the hallway or <unk> Jackson ?
Is it going to eat organic waste ?
This is Yves .
<unk> , or <unk> ?
Or do you get to eat this stuff ?
What is our faith ? Are we related to other people ?
And we 've found that the research research is working with the researchers in the National National Museum of National Research Foundation and the <unk> Foundation , looking for four people , and there are very few areas of <unk> .
And then to bring a group of police to these areas where people are doing something that 's going to happen to the outside of the world , what 's going to happen in the way of crossing cultural culture ?
In my book , I 'm going to <unk> these real principles .
But first , I want to take a few popular attention .
One thing : If you 're very hard trying to try and live , you can live .
That 's wrong .
In fact , in the United States , every 5,000 people survive in the U.S.
Your chances are too small .
There 's still a quarter - long increase in the United States than the population of the American population , but it 's also very difficult to do .
The problem is that we do n't have long longevity .
It 's just the state of <unk> success .
That 's great .
Let me go back to the beginning of my university .
In biology , the definition of <unk> success is the age of kids and the next generation , and your kids have their kids .
And after that age , the biological meaning of biology was completely <unk> .
Whether you 're mammals , mice , volunteers , people , or whatever , it 's the same thing .
So you have to live , you 're not going to have a good way to do it , and you 've got a long - term gene .
And the second thing is , it has to be able to help us leapfrog <unk> , even if you 're going to stop aging .
That 's wrong .
And it says that there are 99 percent of the possibilities for us .
<unk> the size of the brain , just for a few minutes , and no one can get <unk> .
The <unk> will lose the lap to your lap forever .
We 're going to zoom in . The brain is <unk> .
We have 35 billion cells in the body .
The possibility of the problem is that we 're talking about number two .
" These cells are <unk> every eight yards .
Every time they collide with some harm these injuries .
It grows in industry .
And a little bit like that , we 've all had a blank slate with <unk> , and we 're going to copy the <unk> and make friends quickly , <unk> the friends , the speed of <unk> .
That 's also true .
That 's why a nine - year - old age rate is a little 12 times 12 years old .
So if you do n't have any <unk> or stop , I 'm standing there .
In fact , the most glamorous scientific show that humans live in life , of course , is a little bit long .
But this country was killed almost 19 years old .
The distance was obviously 12 years old .
That 's the year we can get .
Research shows that the major <unk> of the year from chronic disease , for example , cancer and diabetes , diabetes and diabetes .
We think that 12 years later , the best way to go to the world is to live in a place where a hundred year - old lives live longer than the ones who live , and that country is very low .
We found that the first <unk> was about 12,000 miles across the coast .
This is about 140 million people , but not the entire island , and they 're only in one of the <unk> , they just live in a <unk> .
That 's the entire amount of people who live in this region are about 10 times in the U.S.
The people in this place are not only about 100 years , and they 're very efficient .
It 's about 19 years old , still bikes , and they 're going to get a little <unk> .
And they 're coming back in love .
That 's the culture of <unk> .
Because in this case , most of them are in the <unk> of <unk> , and the intensity of <unk> is low .
And their diet is <unk> in <unk> , <unk> food .
They found a whole new <unk> of <unk> , which is made from <unk> and a pair of cheese , so Julian <unk> had a high - <unk> <unk> -- three coat coat grocery store -- and it 's a <unk> that is <unk> in the world , and the <unk> is all the known three - dimensional <unk> .
It 's called <unk> <unk> .
But I think it 's a way to depend on their social form .
The most significant phenomena in social societies is , how do they treat older men .
Did you notice the social value of the United States , at about eight years old ?
So look at these ads .
The more powerful it is , more than the older love of the <unk> , the more they enjoy it .
The <unk> of the <unk> 's son , <unk> <unk> , came up with strategies of <unk> .
This has been proven that not only save your parents to be closer to the family , and teaching them about four to six years of life , because these family deaths are very good because of these families .
That 's called <unk> effect .
The second <unk> we 've found on the south side of the Earth are about 3,000 miles across the coast of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> on <unk> islands
The north coast is the beginning of the world .
The most long - lived female is found in this place .
People in this place are the largest <unk> population in the world .
They have something that we want to do .
They live very long , and often they die immediately , usually after sex .
They 've got seven years ahead of the average American population .
That 's five times the U.S.
And in the U.S. and breast cancer , the <unk> of the breast is <unk> .
<unk> died of <unk> disease .
In fact , those sorts of things that vary us to learn a lot about them .
What do they do ?
<unk> food is <unk> .
They are eight times the population of the American population .
And what 's more important is how to eat .
They have all sorts of little strategies for <unk> , and it 's a big problem in the U.S.
We looked at a few strategies , and they were eating with smaller glasses , so they ate less .
It 's not <unk> <unk> , and they 're not aware of it in this type of type , they do n't realize that it 's in service , bringing food to the table .
They have a <unk> claim that I think is unprecedented .
It 's about <unk> .
This food is <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> food .
And all of the people who ate it are n't saying that they 're going to get rid of the eighth grade .
This <unk> is using an hour to the brain .
The only thing to eat is to stop what you 're doing .
But with the penguin , there are very few social structures associated with long - term structures .
We know that <unk> had killed .
And 15 years ago , the average American had three good friends .
There 's only a couple .
If you 're lucky enough to be born in Japan , you 've got a place where four friends of life have to live .
They 're called <unk> , and if you 're in the Grand Canyon , you 've got to share with you , if a child is sick , the child mortality has a bad time to die .
This particular <unk> , this five - year - old women are already <unk> .
They were in average .
In the United States , we have two components of adults .
One of the time is that it 's time to work .
And one day , <unk> , and retired .
That means to go back to <unk> or to Arizona .
There was no battle in the <unk> language .
And there 's a word that does n't happen in your lifetime called " Life values . "
And the simple thing is , " That 's why you wake up morning . "
And for this <unk> - old <unk> , his life is doing it in <unk> .
This <unk> was swimming for three days per week .
In this case , the <unk> Institute gave us <unk> research .
For one problem , their culture is extremely high , which is who explains who <unk> .
And the question is , " What 's your value for your life ? "
They immediately woke up the morning .
And this <unk> - old man , her life is just her <unk> women .
These two women are eight and a half years old .
I asked her what she felt like .
She <unk> on the head and said , " <unk> <unk> . "
I think this is a good idea .
And I was trying to find out what I would find in America .
We 've seen that there 's a very high estimate of Moses <unk> there .
But because of all the young people left .
So again , we count data again .
We found that the most long percentage of the people in the United States lived in <unk> , and these people were focused on <unk> in California .
What <unk> <unk> is .
They went from Saturday , and they were constantly shouting at <unk> .
They called it 24 hours of time .
And it 's about five <unk> of <unk> to their habit of living .
In the U.S. , women lived for 80 years .
But <unk> women , life expectancy is 89 years old .
And the difference between men is more dramatic , and they 're about 11 years old than other American votes .
This research is about seven million people doing it for 30 years .
It 's an ongoing research study . I think it 's romantic .
This is a <unk> crowd .
There were white people , black , <unk> , Asia .
And the only thing about them is that there 's a whole appropriate <unk> , and it 's all about the <unk> of this habit .
They are from the Bible .
<unk> <unk> talks about the blood vessels and the seeds , and I talked about it much more <unk> .
They 're really serious about it .
There are 24 hours a week or five hours of work , and kids need to be inspired in there , so they 're going to take all the things that look like God , in religion , their social <unk> , the <unk> of the natural world , are driven by nature .
This energy is not silenced ; it 's a week .
There is no difficulty .
And <unk> wants to <unk> .
So if you go to a <unk> party , you do n't see the corn of corn or <unk> .
What they 're talking about is the next nature of nature , exchange <unk> and pray .
They affected each other in particular ways .
In this culture , we have <unk> .
<unk> was <unk> .
It 's a <unk> , but a leopard who wants to get rid of the dollar , and he says it 's a money .
So the next three years he goes through the underside of the ice .
As a consequence of <unk> , it 's about to die in his room .
But it does n't look like a diet that does n't look at the <unk> of the surgery .
He was still doing 20 times a month to <unk> his heart .
Yves <unk> , today , is a <unk> cowboy , a morning swimming every morning .
On the weekend , he liked to cover the temple on the stage .
<unk>
<unk> birthday .
Her family lives in <unk> .
She 's <unk> every day .
And then on the bike .
And then she <unk> in the streets of the ice in 1994 , <unk> <unk> , and she was seven different army of volunteers in her high speed .
I 've been over 19 .
Maybe the only <unk> you 've seen across the <unk> is not glamorous .
But let me tell you , there 's no way to do it than transportation , which makes people nuts .
She said , " <unk> is a friend I 've never seen . "
So , what does this three cultures have common ?
What do they do ?
We 're trying to engage with <unk> .
In fact , we 've found two <unk> at the time .
And the first one I want to say is that they do n't work at least as well as we think .
They 're building their lives so that they 're not going to die .
These hundred year - old women come up on the floor , 30 to 40 times a day .
They live in a vacuum , and it 's <unk> .
And every time you go to the shops , the church or the friends go in .
No <unk> .
You do n't have a button and home , and there 's no button .
If you want to do a cake , you do n't want to do it yourself .
That 's what the human population is .
This is the end of the ice and the window .
And the <unk> movement , which is that they enjoy these things , they 're often walking , and it 's proven that the only way to stop cognitive consumption is to have the garden .
They know how to make life , so they have the right idea .
All of the culture is changing .
<unk> pray for <unk> .
This is the <unk> of the ancestor .
But your touch , or stress - <unk> , has all sorts of relationship with disease and disease disease .
It goes down every day , 15 minutes , and it becomes a state of anti - state .
And the idea is that it 's called a meaning of meaning .
One of the most dangerous two years of a person 's life was born , because babies die .
These people know that their purpose is that they live active and they have seven extra lifespans .
There is no long - term food .
These people ate a little bottle of wine every day , not forced to sell for the American people every day .
They 're <unk> food food .
It 's not about <unk> meat , but it 's a lot of <unk> and shit .
They have the way to avoid the <unk> , almost nothing to keep them down .
And that 's exactly how they connected .
Take family and care for the first time kids and children .
They 're building the <unk> of four to 14 years of life , and , of course , you 're going to do four or four .
The most important thing is they belong to a <unk> group .
They are either born in the family of justice or <unk> and <unk> .
We learned that if you have three good friends of friends who are obese , you 've got half obesity .
So if you do n't have a lot of money , you 're going to make a lot of difference .
If you have a friend of your friends , <unk> , or coach or <unk> jobs , they do n't have the food that they have to do , their job to trust , and they 're going to make the biggest effect on your job .
There are no food that can feed two percent of the population to protect two percent of the population .
<unk> projects are usually beginning of last year .
<unk> , no pill or anything can work .
But when you think about your friends , you have a long - term adventure , so it 's the most important thing you 're going to do for life and allowing life to make life .
<unk>
The <unk> of the ink , the <unk> , a <unk> switch , which is transparent , and <unk> music -- these are the things that exist . <unk> <unk> says , now , it 's time to try to figure out how to do these kinds of these new and magic materials -- and then she said , well , trying to understand that these things are going to work and try and do it .
creativity , design , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : <unk> smart material
I had a friend of mine , whose grandfather used a bicycle and a washing machine with a car .
And he did this , because he could n't afford car car , but it 's important because he knows how to tear cars .
We all know a little bit about how it works , and knowing how they make it , so we can create and filter them , or at least based on our understanding .
But we have a lot of <unk> skills in the <unk> of 20 20th century .
But now , the relationship between the community and openness - to - peer resources are <unk> to the values that we have , and then I believe we need to bring this knowledge into the next level , to understand the components of these things .
A lot of people know that , like paper and cloth , how they produced .
But now we have some amazing futures -- like <unk> plastic , allowing you to <unk> paint , rays of paint and light .
So let 's look at some new material .
And this <unk> <unk> , which allows us to jettison the conventional maker of cabinets or wire , directly directly by the <unk> ink .
So for example , I took this little device on my hand , and we made a touch sensor with a <unk> sensor once with the skin , when she touches her skin .
The <unk> of the ink has been used by artists , the latest progress of progress , showing us that we can use it very quickly in the dark and the laser <unk> .
This is a piece of paper <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
There 's only a lot of paper that goes around the edge of the edges , and it 's in the middle of it , the <unk> <unk> , when we do n't look at the <unk> <unk> , when we 're <unk> <unk> .
You know , this material has been used to be used into fashion and multi - touch .
And <unk> <unk> changes color in particular temperature .
I 'm going to put this thing on a <unk> , a little bit taller than the temperature , and then you can see what happened .
In other ways , this material is based on the production of baby <unk> . It can tell you when it 's going to kick down .
These are some of the examples that we normally call smart <unk> .
In a few years , they 're going to be used for a lot of the stuff that we use in our everyday lives .
We may not have the risk of flying cars for us , but we can have a wall of temperature with temperature , and you can fold the keyboard with the glasses and the <unk> switch switch .
I 'm <unk> <unk> , why am I telling the smart <unk> ?
First , I 'm a maker .
And what I have to do about how to work and how I think we should be able to understand the fabric of our world , and now , we 're dealing with these very high - tech materials that do n't make any more .
It 's hard to get these smart <unk> .
It 's very rarely about how to use these materials , and how they make information .
Now , most of them are in trade and <unk> , but only universities and large companies .
So three years ago , I started with a project called <unk> <unk> .
And in that website , we want to join anyone in the room , share experiments , launch information , encouraging others to make <unk> , and collect resources like research and things like us .
We want to make this site a large , collective database database , collecting smart information details .
But why do we care about how smart materials are and how they work with them ?
First , because we ca n't influence things that we do n't understand , we 're not going to do something about it .
We use things , we 're wearing clothes of clothes , and we live in the houses of our lives , our health and the quality of life .
So if we 're going to live in a world of intelligence , we should know and understand them .
Secondly , important , innovation always comes from <unk> .
A lot of the time , it 's a non - <unk> expert , and it 's been invented , and the <unk> , the brain , the raw , the PC , the PC .
The biggest challenge is this complexity , and the demand for expensive equipment .
But it does n't always happen .
Those two scientists in the ' 70s were reported to make a paper that made a difference on a superior way of doing it .
In this experiment , I was a person who did n't have any chemical experience , and he read this essay after his work and the tools of <unk> and tools .
He 's made a oven , and he even <unk> in another scientist in other scientists .
And then <unk> published his experiments on the Internet , including everything that had no success , so others could learn and replicate this experiment .
So the main approach of <unk> is to create a college laboratory in the middle of the building , and then in a garage in Chicago , a museum of cheap materials and <unk> tools to repeat experiments .
At the end of his record , the <unk> of others can be done and then design even more simple steps and improvements .
Another example that I want to share with you is that the goal of the project is <unk> <unk> , and also focused on creator and creative creativity .
It 's very powerful in teaching us how to operate in this way , but they 're designed to <unk> the way that we 're learning .
So the way that the invention , in the other hand , is a series of technologies , and to create something that makes us tick , by teaching us the knowledge of our materials , to try to design the <unk> of the design of what we 're doing .
This is one of my favorite favorites in the design experiments .

In MIT , the foundation of the <unk> Research Foundation is using all sorts of materials to create a series of <unk> , and from regular <unk> to <unk> and ink .
Like a lot of <unk> and all sorts of makers , and the explorers published her toes and allowing anyone to come again .
But the <unk> is one of the most <unk> branches of <unk> , because it allows us to create cheap and flexible devices .
So the work of the invention of development , and her shared evidence , opens the door , has opened a door to a new kind of aesthetic and innovation .
The interesting thing about makers is that we 're creating a passion for passion and curiosity , and we do n't fear failures .
We often think of problems from <unk> , and , in this process , it turns out that other strategies or better ways .
So when more people want to use new materials , more research will share their research ; there 's more makers sharing their knowledge , and we 'll have better opportunities to create all of us .
I feel a little bit like Ted in the ' 70s , and he wrote , " You have to understand the computer now . "
At that time , computers were all about scientists , and nobody wanted to put it into a house .
So I 'm here today to say , " You have to understand a little bit of intelligence .
Bear in mind , it 's the best way to make sense of understanding the most powerful way that we 're in the world .
Thank you .

When we drive it , we 've got a glass bubble on the door , and the <unk> <unk> , in the eye , depend on our eyes , but if we only look at the power of the wing , then if you only see the amount of <unk> and speed , it does n't have to be a <unk> for each customer .

<unk> <unk> : The car of car - <unk> versus <unk>
Let 's face the fact that <unk> is a dangerous thing .
It 's one of the things that we do n't want to think about , but in fact , the <unk> and the Grand Canyon in the world , people have <unk> them on top of this <unk> , which is <unk> the fact that we all <unk> .
It was especially dead , especially in the American population of 16 to 19 years old , and 75 percent of the crashes are not treated with drugs and alcohol .
So what happened ?
Could n't give you the answer , but I remember that I had the first time .
I was still driving the car , and I was walking out of the road at the end of a highway road -- and suddenly I saw the speed of the car .
And I thought , okay , he was slow down , and I was slow .
And I went down .
But I did n't have that guy at that point .
And he was running out of the air , and suddenly , all of a sudden , he was traveling in the high speed .
So speed goes down to zero .
And I was devastated .
I feel my car 's license , and I do n't stop saying that I 'm going to get rid of the car , but I ca n't get permission . But fortunately , lucky is no harm .
But I did n't know that I was going to stop and I thought we could do it better than that .
I think we 're going to make the conversation between the car -- to change our experience .
And I want you to think about it for a moment , which is how to drive experience .
When you look at the car , you 're sitting in a glass bubble .
You ca n't feel it directly .
Because you 're sitting in the car .
Your mission is to calculate that part of the road , and you can only see the speed of your path in other words .
Okay ? You 've got your eyes to push your eyes .
It 's not about the eyes of your eye , but some things you have to do , and you 've got to make it , for example , that you want to be doing something else .
Take the eye away from the wrist .
It 's going to move from you to the directions that you 're looking at , and it 's all over the place where you 've got to get out of where they 're going to move around .
That 's the way that all of you do it safe .
Why do we do that ? Because we have to make a poster to see it , or look at it .
What 's more important ?
We 're very good at doing what we 're going to be doing right now , so that 's what we do .
But we forget some things .
Sometimes , when we realized something about the problem , it was <unk> .
In a lot of accidents they say , " I do n't think so . "
I believe they do .
We see that much .
But existing technologies can help us improve .
In the future of the world and the car , we 're not only seeing three types of cars that are able to see the three cars on the left , and in the upper left - hand corner , you can see that this is the interior of this car .
And we can see the speed of the car , when we 're going to start , you 'll stop or stop .
If you look at the speed of a zero , I can know .
Using <unk> magic and prediction , we can see the future .
You might think that 's not possible .
How do you predict the future ?
In fact , it does n't work for the car .
The cars are three times higher .
It 's on the road .
They 're usually obeying the road .
The future of the future wants to predict what the car is going to do right , and it 's not difficult to make a difference .
And even if you 're in your car , you 've got a pediatrician , and you get <unk> , <unk> miles per gallon -- and I know that you have this experience that 's going to happen instead of <unk> .
And he would have been a half a million years before that .
Right ? I mean , somebody saw him .
In 10 , 30 miles ago , someone saw him , and as soon as a car saw that person saw his message , his location was going to be <unk> in the map .
And you know , because your car will know because the cars are already trying to tell it to it , " Tell you a little bit about a five - year - old , notice . "
You can make <unk> predictions for cars .
They 're just the object of Newton .
This is the truth .
So how do we do that ?
We can start to share data from the car , and it 's only about sharing GPS .
If my grandparents had <unk> and <unk> , I could clearly clear my position .
So for the computer perspective , I can predict where the cars around me are , they 're going to move .
Supermarkets as well .
They also know where the opposite is , and they know where the other cars are .
What happens if you want to share the data , if they 're going to talk to each other ?
I can tell you the answer .
Both models are going to increase .
<unk>
And <unk> and his team did a computer , and what happens when we unite different <unk> of <unk> , even though it 's only in the transportation world , but then we 're using this research to use the use of the brain , using the sensors that are on the spinal cord , on these robots , they use <unk> sensors , which are really very common on those robots .
And we 're going to take the <unk> of a <unk> radio .
And when these robots meet each other , they can be tracked very precisely , but they 're able to avoid each other .
We have a lot of robots right now , and we 've also met some problems .
One of the problems is that when it 's too strong , it is hard to deal with all kinds of information , so you have to <unk> that pattern in this situation .
If your robot machines are tracking all the <unk> trajectory , then you do n't have enough benefits to attention .
You can put it in the <unk> , looking at some <unk> .
That <unk> might be a <unk> .
So you can predict a new path .
So you do n't know how it 's going to jump into you , and you know what it is .
And you can also know what you 're going to remind you about the authority .
And we kept trying to do that , and how do we remind people about it ?
How can you get to each other and say , " You 've got to stay inside . "
This is the ability to depend on the skill of two first cars .
If a person 's a big car , he 's on the phone , and you know , it 's going to be the state of <unk> <unk> , which is the state of <unk> .
So we came up with a independent study of research and <unk> .
We use a series of cameras , and we can monitor this driver 's license , looking forward to look at the lens and look down at the bottom .
And we can predict what the driver is , where cars are going to be the fastest of the car where the cars will come up with the most safe <unk> of the <unk> .
The fundamental part of this is that these technologies are now becoming reality .
And I think the biggest problem we have is whether we 're willing to share our own data .
And I think that this is a very tough idea , thinking about our own car that we 're going to share with the other car , and we 'll share that for the rest of the population , like driving around us .
But I think it 's going to be successful in protecting us as well as now , when I 'm outside , and I ca n't really understand you .
When I look at your mailbox , I do n't know who you are .
I think our car is completely <unk> behind us .
And I think this is a very good thing .
I hope you can think of it for a moment , if you do n't want to get the <unk> young young generation behind you , knowing that you 're going to get wet .
By the way , we can achieve our data , and we can do it .
So let 's raise your car .
It would make us safer .
Thank you .

Peter <unk> on Stephen Hawking 's experience to zero gravity
You know , I 've got a lot of passion for my people to explore space .
I have a chance to have the greatest <unk> expert in the world , and once the experience of zero gravity is incredible .
Now I want to tell you this story .
I saw him in the first time in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
That 's a competition we organize with the first <unk> of the <unk> gene , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> people in 10 <unk> groups .
We called them the gene .
That was the meeting of <unk> <unk> .
And I met Professor Hawking who said his dreams are space traveling .
I said , I ca n't carry you there , but I can make you experience .
He said , well , of course .
So in the way , the only way to experience it on Earth is to try to understand how to experience <unk> flights .
You 're sitting on the plane , and you 're going to get 25 seconds .
And then you go down , you lower weight .
And so over and over .
And most of you experience experience - to - a - half minutes of gravity , which is NASA , who has been trained to train them .
So we did that .
We spent 11 years on the project .
When we announced we had to take a look at Steven Hawking .
We have a government of government and a company who says you 're mad ? No , you 've got his life .
But he wanted to go .
We get permission from a lot of effort .
And six months later , we sat down in the <unk> .
We 've got a <unk> , and we announced that we 're ready to do a four - gravity flight that takes 25 seconds to make his zero gravity .
We might have done three three times .
We asked , why do n't we think about this ?
And so he said to me .
And he said , " Life on Earth is the dangers of <unk> destruction .
If you do n't have the universe , we do n't have the future .
So I want to encourage the public interest to the universe . "
We brought him to the <unk> center of the NASA center , and then we came up with the airplane .
We 've got 20 percent of the people who have been raised with our kids , and we 're funded to raise a hundred million dollars for the kids to fly .
There are TED Fellows .
We 're ready to think about it .
There are four <unk> of the airplane and two nurses .
We looked at his blood pressure in the moment , and his reputation <unk> , his heart , and his blood pressure .
We 're ready to get all the industries , and you do n't want to harm the world .
This is where we flew from the Gallup Canyon .
<unk> , I 'd like to close with my <unk> , and I 'm going to close with my <unk> , and he 's going to go into zero gravity .
By the end of the day , we 're going to make him feel something that really <unk> <unk> .
And after the first time , you know what doctors say , he says , " Well , let 's continue . "
And then we did the second flying flight .
Three .
In response to the love of <unk> Newton , we found that floating , a apple apple , because Professor Hawking teaches you that there 's a little bit of love at the end of the day .
And then we did the third , <unk> , <unk> .
Okay , <unk> .
And he did n't look like a 65 - year - old man .
And he 's happy .
We live in a very precious toy , and we left this planet .
Let 's start with this amazing exploration .
Thank you .

[ <unk> <unk> ] <unk> shows the cells .
I 'm a medical artist , and I look at a different perspective .
I grew up observing , and I was looking at the art of beauty in art and <unk> and beauty and beauty .
Because art and science are very glamorous -- they have a lot of beautiful things -- <unk> , as a thought of science and mathematical research , like a <unk> twins who thinks that every scientist thinks .
And this is something that matters in awe of globalization , which means that these things are worth <unk> .
They 're powerful , they ca n't simplify it .
They 're unique , they 're useful -- it 's a very long time to get out of it .
In fact , you can start to show you some images , because I do n't want to see myself on the screen .
<unk> with beauty , often , for non - scientific areas .
They can describe beauty in their own unique way , but only when you understand the language and grammar , you 'll understand it . The truth is that it really relates to beauty .
And then you take math , E = = <unk> , or the universe , the <unk> of the cosmos , where you can feel that life has to be <unk> from the figures of evolution -- that 's hard to understand the world .
What I 'd like to do is , since I 've been trained to become a medical Japanese company -- because I 'm teaching me to <unk> technology , he 's a <unk> and my visual mentors , and I hope they 're going to be able to find a solution , to try to figure out how to understand the truth , it 's to help people understand what 's going on in the world , by being told , that they do n't even know what it is .
The students are often in a kind of a context where they 've been born with beauty , but the way they 're taught is to be cut down , and it 's not always that way .
It 's like a old chicken coat <unk> , and <unk> <unk> until the <unk> goes down .
We do n't want to do that .
So we have opportunity to really transform education .
A couple of years ago , I 've got a call from Harvard , <unk> <unk> , who asked me , " Well , if I have a group of interest with my team , it 's a way to change medical and scientific methods .
So we started a project of cells exploration , and this is going to show the <unk> of molecules in the biology of the molecule , so that it 's a whole lot of <unk> , and it 's going to make all sorts of connections that are connected together .
And they 're going to form cells that are <unk> cells , cells like a large , big , complex , very complex city .
These little machines are the center of life .
These little machines , it allows us to envy the world that the global engineer is <unk> , and they can self - <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
These little machines allow cells to move .
They replicate the cells , they allow us to sleep .
<unk> us .
What we want to do is how to talk about this story , and this is a website of Harvard <unk> , which is the director of the blueprint of this molecule , the founder of <unk> - enabled cells , as a textbook , with all the teachers in the world , to <unk> all sorts of things that they 're going to be able to look at all of these things , so that these students can be <unk> from the cells and then they can continue to understand the fact that the <unk> is <unk> by the
So we started working on these molecules , and we 're starting to work with those molecules .
And we came up with a button , and that was , that 's , you 've got an alternative to a capillaries that <unk> them with capillaries and they collected these signals from the cells to <unk> the signal from <unk> <unk> .
But the information they get , they stop them , and they keep them together , allowing them to change the shape of the cell , to try to figure out what 's going on by lettuces , to try to figure out what 's stopping what 's going on .
So these machines of these molecules -- we have to work with Harvard scientists working together , using a database of proteins , and figuring out how they 're moving , what they do .
And I think it 's going to happen in a way that is happening in the real world , but not that true , because actually cells are <unk> that way .
And what I 'm going to show you is a three - minute video clip , which is the first part of the book that we 're doing .
And I asked you to look at this side of these cells , and these little ones are looking at the machine , which is driving proteins -- they 're <unk> in the size of the size of the ants .
Please play animation .
But the machine of these cells is really surprising , and they 're really the foundation of all life because all these machines are communicating with each other .
They 're more than each other .
They decided that they did different events .
In space , cells use it to read gene molecules from the brain , and then it 's the right part of the building .
There is no life , from the smallest life of the <unk> , if you do n't have these little machines .
In fact , you do n't have these machines , Chris , today , to be very <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> .
This little guy called <unk> proteins for a single <unk> of protein , where anything that needs to be -- whatever it requires -- whether it 's <unk> , or something that does n't matter what it is , what is <unk> .
Every cells we have in our bodies , about 10 million of these guys , are moving around , and we 're about 100 billion cells .
So no matter what you think you have , you 're not doing anything .
When you go home , I hope you can think about it , thinking about how powerful our cells are .
Think of the kinds of things that we 're working on .
Once we understand all of the things in the cells -- believe me , we 're about to know about one percent of them -- once we know that cells are going to be able to control our health , our next generation . Our lives .
And the hope is that we can achieve more and more beautiful and beautiful .
These cells , these little machines , are really incredible , they can not realize what cells need to do .
They <unk> , they make cells do what they need to do .
They 've been trying to make it all the way to the body -- that 's what they 're never seen .
Keep your next show . Thank you .

And the <unk> project in the year was in his little <unk> , and it was open to the country , but when it broke , when <unk> <unk> had a job , his <unk> would become an old experience . At this talk , she describes her as a special experience for the United States .

<unk> : I 'm sick of my dad .
I am a writer , a <unk> , and I 'm also a very strong man , so I know a lot of <unk> about 22 years .
And one of the things that I learned about three years ago is that it becomes invisible .
I became a homeless guy .
And I quit my papers published in my dad , and I decided to go traveling in the February of the year .
His death was really big .
And it was doing that because there were many things that I 'd like to feel like .
And I was traveling every day , and I decided that it was a long time to live in the car for a year .
So , I took my cat , my <unk> and my toes of the road to the east , and I was swimming from the 1980 's , to see a lot of big things , but they had three serious things .

Two : I do n't realize the negative words of people who are much more powerful than the influence of us .
Three : I do n't realize that old is a <unk> , not a lifestyle .
At the beginning , it was great .
I went into <unk> , normal to eat .
And the clock is ticking for emotions .
But then the <unk> and <unk> of my dad died and started <unk> .
And I ended up with my freedom to work , and I need to get a full job for my <unk> .
From a very gentle spring , what 's going to happen in a pretty stressful summer .
And no matter where it is , it 's obvious that I 've got a cat and a dog , and very hot .
It goes from the <unk> .
The dog came up to the patient 's heart .
I 'm going to die .
Whenever you go to the office , I 'm going to use the <unk> of the offices and the trucks .
Or in the public toilet hat .
At the end of the night , it 's rarely going to fall down to 80 degrees below , and it 's almost impossible to sleep .
The food is under <unk> .
There were several hours of ice in the ice , and it was very glamorous .
I did n't have a lot of money , or I could n't find a place where I could go to the place .
I do n't want to throw them away . So I 'm going to stay in a <unk> .
But the weather in <unk> makes me <unk> to 50 ft , the public , and when I went up to the <unk> , I had <unk> and glue when the pointer was .
When it comes to the end of the winter , the temperature goes down to 280 . And then it 's so cold .
I met a bunch of new problems .
And every night my car would stop in different places . That would reject police to police .
And of course , not every time of success .
But I think I ca n't control my life .
And I do n't know when it 's going to happen , and I 'm so fast from one <unk> , which is a very , very strong , a woman who lived in the car .
I do n't have anything . I did n't have a <unk> .
And my <unk> , my values , all of my things about these things .
But in a sense , I changed .
And I became increasingly depressed , as a matter of a matter of knowledge .
And then someone introduced me to one of my homeless health clinics .
I went . I had no <unk> .
I do n't feel very frustrated with these people , as opposed to the other person .
I do n't have feathers or <unk> .
When some of the old people realized that , as a professor at college , they said , " You 're not a Republican , what are you here ? "
The other homeless people are not going to look at me as a homeless person , but I 'm like that .
And then I heard my story , and he said , " You have jobs , hopefully .
The real prison is not determined . "
And the other side of the clinic is <unk> for me , so I have a little bit of <unk> , and I remember thinking , " If I 've lost a suicide , maybe nobody could find it . "
And after that time , a friend of mine told me , she heard about the <unk> of the road , and a journalist from the National Academy talks about me .
A <unk> I wrote about my dad in his dad , and he wrote a year before he died .
And he was doing <unk> speaking at the time .
And when I found out the <unk> of the road , I was talking about my writing on his writing , and I lived in the car .
Ah , you should be <unk> .
And I started laughing , because this is the question , and I 'm a writer , or a Jewish woman ?
So I went into a hall , and I found out the book books .
I 'm standing there and I read it again .
I was crying .
Because I 'm a writer .
It was a writer .
And after that , I went through the Tennessee Sea .
Sometimes it 's in the car , sometimes the <unk> sleep .
And I started writing again .
In summer , I became a <unk> .
I had to win my own apartments in my own apartment .
I stopped <unk> .
I 'm no longer ignored .
There are hundreds of people who are working on a lot of time , and they live in their car .
But social societies continue to live in their transportation , or sleep in the streets .
So the homeless , the job , is jobs , but most of the people , most of the <unk> .
But if you 've seen it , hire them , encouraging them .
The human spirit can be overcome everything .
I 'm not doing a job for homeless people .
I 'm not going to encourage you to <unk> the next one you can see .
And I 'm here to tell you , according to the experience of the past , not from the place where they 're <unk> , or they decide in any time of life .
Three years ago , I lived in a car car park , and I was at the TED stage .
It 's always going to be forever forever , forever . Thank you .

Yves <unk> : <unk> , let 's make it better .
Welcome to Thailand .
Over 40 years ago , I was a young boy , and this country was very , very poor .
We have to change everything , but we do n't have any benefits , or <unk> plan .
We started doing <unk> <unk> , and we 've got a very successful health care program .
In general , if the kids could n't survive , it would n't get a lot of <unk> .
So , the first step is to <unk> the lives of your mother and the mother .
It 's not enough to control the babies of the baby , but you still need <unk> .
So I 'm going to show you a little bit about why we 're going to do this .
In <unk> , in my country .
The average family has seven kids , population growth .
There 's no problem in the future .
We have to reduce population growth .
So we decided , " Close action . "
And the women said , " We agree . We can use <unk> , but we need doctors doctor . " " <unk> is n't a few doctors .
We do n't have <unk> ; we try to solve this problem .
We 're giving nurses to nurse and <unk> , and they are women , they 're doing fantastic methods .
That 's really good , but it 's also helping to help across 20 percent of the country .
What do you do with the 80 percent ?
No , we decided to make more effort .
So we 've seen these people that you see here .
In fact , in that yellow line -- hopefully they do n't get rid of it , because the bottom line is <unk> .
We used to be more <unk> than <unk> .
And the ordinary folks can be <unk> , and they 're helping people 's goal .
They 're very upset with their people who know that the customer is God , and they 're not trying to figure out what 's going on .
They can provide <unk> and <unk> in the country .
So , we 're looking for these people to help . They 're actually helping us solve problems .
Some of the places that you 're looking at -- you see these <unk> women -- in <unk> -- here 's a corn market selling bananas and crab gas , and you can find a lot of <unk> in Thailand , you 'll find <unk> supplies .
And then we decided to find a religious person , and in the Philippines , the influence of the <unk> is very big .
We went to them , and they said , " Can you help help ? "
And I was in the blue <unk> , and I did n't know , I 'm not doing that , but my hand on the side of the hand , I put it on the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the families in the Gulf .
This photo goes across the country .
Some of them are doing the same job in their villages .
And women say , " There are no side effects .
That 's <unk> <unk> . "
And they do that .
We went to teachers .
You need everybody who 's involved , and a force is more human .
So we went to the teachers .
More than a dozen people in school , learn about the new alphabet , B , C is <unk> , and I 'm the Grand Canyon .
And then we then have an intellectual <unk> game , killing the <unk> .
If you 're in the middle of your mailbox , you can continue <unk> .
For example , " Mom <unk> <unk> . "
Very good , Mother . <unk> .
uncles bought a license . Very good , uncles . <unk> .
The uncles got up , no use of <unk> . Yves , <unk> . "
This is called <unk> .
And kids have these things in school .
We had <unk> <unk> , and we 've got <unk> seals .
At first , the privilege of <unk> became the most intimate friends of girls .
In Thailand , the diamond is very glamorous to poor people , so it 's the best friend of the girls , and the girl 's best friends .
In 1975 , we started <unk> the first <unk> of policy , and the women who said , " We only have a loan for women .
If you 're pregnant , you have to think about it .
If you do n't have a pregnancy , it can be <unk> us . "
This is based on their organization .
35 years later , the project was in 2000 .
Now this is an organization that 's been developed in rural villages , and it 's not a real bank , but a foundation -- empowering .
We do n't need a big organization to manage this project . It 's based on <unk> .
And here , you might be very difficult to see Thailand , and all of the women are women -- women , women and women .
And then we thought we should help the U.S. , because America does n't help .
This is seven - year - old <unk> .
We decided to employ all of the men for all men , and remember the male male men that could enjoy special operations in the U.S.
Get us out of the hotel . This is a really bad room .
At the end of the day , they say , " Okay , we 'll take lunch .
Of course , I have to have an American Coke .
There are two options , <unk> and Pepsi .
<unk> food has photons and <unk> . "
I think it 's a bit more <unk> .
This man is called <unk> <unk> , and he 's funded for the American Public International .
And obviously , he was doing a lot of <unk> , looking at his hand , just half his head , and it was n't <unk> .
This is a lot of news in the United States to make a bunch of people in the United States .
And I said , " No job . You 'll come here , and we 'll have everybody to do it . "
How ?
And in all the effort , seven percent of the family goes up to 150 percent , and population growth goes down to 85 percent .
You can call it <unk> , because we use the same strategy .
I do n't know that <unk> learn us , we learn them , and we 're <unk> .
This is the result of all of us .
At the time of the government , we did n't have enough doctors .
But the only way to do that is to change people 's attitudes and behavior .
And then HIV took Thailand . We have to stop the workforce for AIDS .
Unfortunately , the government <unk> our actions .
Our job is not <unk> .
So I thought , " Well , since you ca n't get to the government , it goes to the military . "
I went to the military and borrow them 300 <unk> .
They have a lot of radio glasses than the government , their faces much more than government .
I asked them whether they could help us cook .
I 'll show them . They say , " Okay . You can use all of our radio and TV . "
So we can do it in the air .
And then we had <unk> Prime Minister .
And he said , " Hey , do you want to join us ? "
And he invited me to join me because he was very excited .
I said , " Okay . "
He became HIV / AIDS and increased the budget .
All of the ministers , even the judges , have to accept AIDS education . Everybody , people , religious organizations , institutions -- all sorts of participation .
Every media community has to adopt AIDS .
We 're going to make a lot of money for each of the radio or TV ads .
They 're very excited about this .
All the schools started to HIV / AIDS , first from college .
These high school students are teaching other MIT schools .
In <unk> , the girls are <unk> . They 're very reasonable .
And the girls who come to the campus are <unk> , and they 're called " <unk> <unk> . "
Next , we 're going to get closer .
These are <unk> -- high - wing -- they 're going to shoot the entire village across the town , and the whole continent goes up to Thailand , <unk> AIDS , remix things to the house .
There are no parents , because it 's saving lives , and it is a movement for life .
We called it " everybody . "
All of the companies realized that the patient could not work ; they could n't buy it .
They were all trained .
This is " <unk> <unk> , " which goes to school at Harvard .
And he was very popular . He was necessary .
Every state , every police need an image , and the job should be the most glamorous thing that he 's wearing .
We 've got hundreds of thousands of people on the streets , where we go .
They have <unk> .
The other thing is , when you 're driving , <unk> will send you <unk> -- this is our " <unk> project . "
Can you imagine the city of New York City ?
I do n't have any problem . They 'll be <unk> . I can imagine they 're standing in the street now .
The hand on your hand is sending out the <unk> people .
And the new product came to us , and we 've got to give you the <unk> , if the leopard <unk> had a <unk> .
These are the ones that we engineered .
This is what it said : " mass <unk> " .
We found that some people were looking at the mass of mass destruction , but we found a large amount of <unk> .
This one is written by a <unk> pattern , " Get away . "
And I 'll give you later .
But let 's remind you , these are the size of the <unk> , so it 's going to be <unk> .
You see , <unk> is really <unk> .
You see here . I gave <unk> and Bill <unk> One .
It said , " Stop global warming ; please use <unk> . "
This one I told you earlier earlier -- large - scale <unk> .
Let 's save more lives .
Put it around .
And the last one , in Thailand , we do n't say , " God , therefore , our role is , say we 're going to take it . "
You can see that , in order to make a better life , we do everything .
All the <unk> and schools in the schools are preserved because people are easy to fall down .
So what happens ?
And all of the results are involved .
The data in the United Nations shows that HIV / AIDS reports doubled 90 percent of the World Wide Web reports showing that our actions save hundreds of thousands of lives .
Otherwise , I ca n't see that much in the street today .
This is telling you , you can do it .
90 percent of them are from Thailand .
There are two help of help , economic help .
This is not just the experts , the doctors and the nurses .
We all need to be <unk> .
And then we decided to get people out of poverty , we 're going to stop HIV , and this time , the government does n't have to educate the relationship between the government , the corporate government and the authorities started to start working on cooperative cooperation , so it 's the beginning of the political government to begin to dominate the cooperation of cooperation and it is n't going to go through the education system and start doing the same amount of work , which is that governments are starting to blame the cooperative and a government .
It 's also true that poor people are <unk> , but they 're not tips .
These have to be provided by <unk> .
We do n't help them . We 're doing it .
The only way to <unk> is entrepreneurship .
We succeeded .
The money came to the village , and the <unk> took money .
And that 's not what it is .
And they 're going to pay money on the money to fund the <unk> Foundation , which is the village growth .
You all participate , they feel their bank bank , because money is their own .
Before the loan , you have to be <unk> .
We believe that if you want to help the people who are today , then you need to give them a loan .
<unk> had to become a fundamental human rights .
Otherwise , they never get out of poverty .
But before you get to the loan , you have to be <unk> .
This project is called " <unk> <unk> , " which teaches you how to do this , and they 're going to make a difference .
These are the business they do : sell mushrooms , crabs , metals , vegetables , clothing , fruits , fruit / <unk> , this village is funded by <unk> International .
They said , " They should stop the shoes and the <unk> .
These are more people , because we can afford it . "
We also have <unk> , Thailand .
And as we did on the left , we still have <unk> <unk> , and then we sell to the <unk> .
This is before the <unk> of the television show , and we can talk to me .
This is a quote of Thailand in Thailand -- " coffee and <unk> . "
And the Starbucks has to keep you <unk> , and we make you persistent and enliven you .
It 's very different .
Can you imagine what you 're going to buy in a hospital ?
You can also take a little bottle of milk , and you can get a few <unk> .
And finally , in education , we want to treat the schools , to turn it into a place of time .
This is called the <unk> <unk> program .
This is a center for economic development .
To school , it makes it community .
This is an architectural building , all buildings are done .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , if you see this leopard , is very proud of it .
We <unk> the land around the place , and people can <unk> themselves .
And finally , I 'm convinced that if we want to achieve <unk> , the Millennium Development <unk> -- we need to <unk> the <unk> .
And of course , I think we 're going to solve babies dying , and then everyone 's got to do it . Everybody should have a force for <unk> .
We have a large <unk> of military weapons now .
We also also asked the rest of the world to save lives .
And finally , this is our inheritance .
These are Thailand , " <unk> . "
Thank you very much .

For you , <unk> might be like your friend . But the real friend will give you a smile to you in the <unk> , and it 's a mini - <unk> robot that allows you to take a cup of glasses on the table , can help you .

<unk> <unk> : A <unk> robot
There 's a robot in the house , and you have the robot , you know , you have a robot .
Well , not too much .
OK . These are the ones in the hands of the hand , and the robot 's robot is n't <unk> ?
<unk> .
Thank you , to put it down .
That 's what we 're going to do with the team -- and I 've got the question of dealing with you -- trying to solve the problem .
Our goal is to draw a kind of robot , whether you 're eight or 80 .
And we found that this really is a very difficult problem , because it 's not only answering you the robots that you build , <unk> , cost - control , and you 're trying to make the robot enough , allowing them to go home .
This robot can not be too ugly .
And he should be quite cute .
He 's a <unk> .
<unk> used to use the equipment that you already know -- your iPhone -- as his brain .
With the iPhone <unk> and the sensor , we have about 150 dollars a little bit about the robot , and it 's only twice the amount of robots that are used in the past .
Now , <unk> <unk> is now , right now .
And he noticed on the phone of mobile phones and tracking my face .
And if I hit my head , he plays with me .
He was worried about it , so he never left me .
And if I want to get here , he will go .
If I want to -- I 'm very clever .
And if I went close to him , he would feel like a little bit of <unk> .
In many ways , <unk> is about to your prescription for you .
Thank you .
Yeah .
If I want to explore this world -- <unk> <unk> -- if I wanted to rely on the world , I can connect with other devices .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's going to be able to get into the machine .
So now I can see all the things that you see in the world .
We put a free <unk> in <unk> , if you 're on your hand , and we 're able to control this robot now and play it together .
So let me quickly quickly show you the clip of the video now , and you can see me and the whole audience .
And if you 're standing in front of the <unk> .
If I want to control the <unk> , you can get a few buttons .
And I can make him move back and forth .
I 'd like to take a photograph of a TED audience .
<unk> ! Yves .
And the same way , you can zoom in on the <unk> of <unk> , and I can adjust the camera .
This is what you see from the eyes of the eye .
And finally , <unk> as a extending , I could change his face .
So I can go into it , and then I 'll make it excited .
And what we 're creating is one of the most important ways to think about it is that his operation has to be very , very literal .
Anyone should n't need to do a lot of money .
Now , who want to live ?
Okay , cool .
Give you .
Thank you , Scott .
And the cool thing is , even if you get to the Grand Canyon , you do n't have a wrist control .
In fact , he can be able to <unk> video with two smart instruments in the two two days .
So , for example , you can walk through the browser , and it 's like a bee phone called the wheel .
We 've talked about <unk> visual effects that are very cool .
Imagine a eight year - old <unk> , and her mother gave her a <unk> robot .
<unk> can take her iPhone to the robot .
<unk> can go into the <unk> and play with the King of England , and if you 're playing 15 minutes per year , if there 's a few months , she might have a number of opportunities to meet his own daughter .
Thank you , Scott .
So , <unk> is now doing some cool things .
And then I want to share with you the goal of the future .
This is actually one of our engineers on a weekend in a weekend .
And it based on Google , and it 's called an open source of open source <unk> .
And it allows you to create anything you want to do with your <unk> code .
You do n't need to know how to do that .
And what you 're going to do is simulate your behavior in the browser , and that 's what <unk> did right now .
And if you want to be able to send the code to your robot , in the real real context of the world .
If these programs are proud of you , you can share all the <unk> on the world to share your code .
So this <unk> robot is actually actually working with each other .
We have the biggest <unk> for anyone who can train robots because we think that personal robots are <unk> .
Everybody needs to be different .
And we think , if you 're going to make robots in the house , this robot should be your imagination .
I hope that I can describe the personal robot in the future .
But I do n't know .
But we know that it 's not going to be a lot of <unk> robots , or 100 billion dollars a year .
The personal <unk> of the future will come back to the beginning of what 's going to depend on your own creativity , to move a little bit of a kind of <unk> robot that looks like a <unk> <unk> that is so tiny .
We 've been able to ensure that you 're going to get a robot and see your imagination .
Thank you .

Yves <unk> tells passionate stories
Thank you very much . Stand up , you 've got a little bit scary .
I 'm going to tell you about passion .

What are the solutions ? The answer : the story .
I 've got a good story , and I hope it 's a story that 's really true to the truth , and it 's a story of the truth , and it 's a story of the human mind .
I 'm interested in all of the stories that I 've been writing until my writing .
There are some specific themes in my face : <unk> , honest , violence , death , political , social and social problems .
I know everywhere around us , so I wrote about the <unk> , <unk> emotion , passion , dreams , nature , magic .
In the last 20 years , I published some books , and I had a lot of life at the age of 2007 , when I was in Italy .

Please tell me about the story of romantic love .
And one of the <unk> of an Olympic deadline was I was observed as a <unk> .

In fact , I 'm not sure if I ca n't help and get out of the way .
They tell me that this is not a joke .
This will be the first time to be captured by women .
Five women represented five continents , three Olympics and three engines .
And so , really , my first question is , what do I wear ?
She <unk> , she woke up , and she asked me to ask me .
My size is my size .
I 'd like to imagine that I was wearing a rockstar bucket like a <unk> boy .
In August , I arrived in <unk> , hundreds of thousands of people who welcome out of the world .
And those <unk> will be able to do it in the game .
They were supposed to win , but there was a male factor there .
An ice is <unk> , a half ice ice , and the wind can influence it .
But , most importantly , more than train or luck .
Only the fear of fear and <unk> people can win .
That 's passion .
The streets of <unk> are covered with the Red Cross and wrote the CD on the Olympics .
<unk> . Is n't that true ?
<unk> can drive us and determine our fate .
That 's the role that I 'm going to describe in my book .
I need a character , and I 'm inspired by the <unk> , the role of the risks and the action of a change and the role of the brain .
That 's what you 're going to do .
The good news is not fun .
They 're just good ones .
In the computer room room , I 've met three <unk> , three athletes and actors .
There are two women who have come from the Nobel Prize in Kenya from Kenya , <unk> <unk> , she grows over 300 million volumes , and in that behavior , it changed in this behavior . Of course it also improved a lot of villages .
<unk> <unk> : She <unk> all the passionate passion for <unk>
And when she was 14 , her grandfather would sell her <unk> .
She told us that these girls were being raped by the women who had sex with men .
And <unk> forced them to be <unk> every day , if they insisted , they 're going to die .
In the green room I got my uniform .
And that 's not exactly what I normally do , but it does n't feel like I think she 's a little bit like a <unk> boy .
I look like a <unk> .
All of the <unk> are wearing uniform , except <unk> <unk> , and she 's <unk> beautiful and passionate .
<unk> is over 70 years old , but still it 's great .
She 's glamorous , she 's <unk> and very high and high .
How do you sustain the skin and do n't <unk> ?
I do n't know .
And television was asked , " How do she look good ? "
And she said , " <unk> . My back , I 'm not going to make noise like a man . "
So now you 've got one of the most beautiful women from Earth .
Do n't get me wrong , do n't always say no . No , no , no , no .
She 's not exactly what she said .
At the end of the night , we 're calling the <unk> on the other side , and it 's the same music player in the background , but the way the music players are doing it .
<unk> <unk> is standing in front of me , if I do n't have any <unk> .
She 's got a little bit like Africa , and she 's going to die in the middle of the African age , where I 'm on the end of it , I 've got the foot behind the feet , so that my head is really <unk> up to <unk> and so forth , so my head is actually in there .
All the photos , of course , are <unk> .
I 'm also fortunate to be lucky because there 's a picture of my existence , although it 's in <unk> .
That 's where most men have left .
The great four of my greatest four minutes in the Olympic Congress .
And my love for me , I think , is n't <unk> , and even if I explained to him , it does n't have a four minutes , so he should n't think I 'm right .
I left every four minutes because I would never forget , even my old age , <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm also going to give you the authority of the Olympics , which is " passion . "
The next story is still with passion .
In 1995 , in <unk> , there was the <unk> of the Congo River , and it 's a <unk> <unk> .
By the way , 80 percent of the people in the world are women and <unk> .
These places are not sold in Congo , even though they 're not killed , and eventually it 's been killed or starve .
The <unk> of the story is young women , <unk> and her children .
She 's a <unk> <unk> .
The soldiers forced her husband to be tortured to death .
But she had to do a couple of months to support her family , after a few months later she had a number of twins .
Two boy , two boys .
She took it to her hair , and she brought it on his hair .
And she 's going to be the name of the twins named the Red Cross for two <unk> , and they 're doing their care for their attention , to feed them , because she does n't feel her .
And when the soldiers went into her house and tried to rape her big daughter , she grabbed her , and she did n't even have a gun , even though she was <unk> .
And regardless of this family , the family had 16 months later , and she had a young American <unk> in the United States , <unk> her compassion to the U.S. <unk> and her nine - year - old <unk> came into the <unk> of Arizona .
In Swahili , it means " love . "
My book in my book is <unk> and <unk> women , as well as romantic .
They 're not fiction ; they do n't need to be <unk> .
It 's everywhere .
I 've been working with women and women .
I 'm very familiar with them .
And a long time ago was born at a very long place in the middle of a <unk> overdose .
And when I was five years old , it was n't the name of the word " <unk> , " which was not very popular , so nobody knew what I did .
And so soon , I found that I had to make a lot of money to enjoy the freedom , and to my cousin .
But I 'm still going to <unk> , because I 've got twice the rest of the time .
And when I was 20 years old , my daughter <unk> said to me , " I 'm going to get tired of me .
And we did n't have a stand - up son , right ?
And indeed , the women in my daughter and the audience are really obsolete , but they 're still not going to be used for the rest of the world , and they do n't have to do it in a very short hour , or a child who does n't want to work or not .
It ca n't control their body and life .
It ca n't be free .
raped , <unk> , and sometimes <unk> was killed .
For most of the Western young women , the young American women are called <unk> .
<unk> will never be glamorous , but I 'm not going to lose you , and I do n't have a lot of <unk> <unk> .
Even <unk> did n't die .
It 's just the beginning of the evolution of evolution , if you do n't like <unk> in God .
It 's called love and <unk> or <unk> , and if you like it , it 's not important for us to understand and understand it .
I 'll tell you one passion , but a sad story .
This is the little women in the village in <unk> .
Time is in 2005 .
<unk> is a young American <unk> in her three weeks when she went to this clinic .
She was ready to get rid of the teeth , but when she went there , she did n't have a doctor who had no access to the car .
They 're outside the women , and they 're waiting for a few hours to come .
The first patient 's <unk> was tortured because she had <unk> <unk> .
The only solution to <unk> is that it 's a bad solution to the teeth .
She did n't have the same thing before she did .
She 's carrying a huge risk of risk and very nervous .
She did n't even have a good tool for the right tools , but she did n't get her .
There was a bold heart and passion .
She did it after she did surgery .
And finally , the patient got her <unk> .
This man broke a lot of teeth .
And the next day , when she comes back to this , she 's the first patient 's patient with her husband .
She looks like a big face .
She ca n't see her eyes .
She was very upset with her husband 's husband .
And that was really surprising for her , but when the patient explained it was n't the case for the patient .
At the day , her husband was <unk> her , only because she was n't ready for him .
There are also six million people who live like this .
They 're really the first poor people .
Despite women , they work in two thirds , but they only have less than one percent of their inheritance .
And the same job is that their cost is less than male , even though they get paid , because they do n't have the independent capabilities and they 're often <unk> violence and <unk> .
In fact , if you give women to liberal arts education , jobs and control and the ability to control their revenue , the capacity to make benefits for society .
If women get involved in her ability to increase her children and family .
If the family becomes better , the village <unk> the whole country as well .
<unk> . <unk> <unk> came to Kenya .
She talked to women and explaining why the land is not because they get tired of trees .
She 's allowing women to grow new trees and <unk> slowly .
And after five or six years , they had a forest of forests , and Palestinians were killed .
In the poorest , women are women in the most <unk> fashion .
And obviously the truth is , it 's always being ignored by the fact that governments are not lying .
And in the Women 's project , the men had a hundred dollars per year .
Women are raised by human visibility .
It will change the way that women are going to change everything , design and play .
And I would assure you that if women work together , values , wisdom , <unk> , they have a liberal arts and <unk> .
In any kind of war , most of the victims are mostly women and children . They 're passive victims .
And the men are <unk> , and you 're looking at that .
It 's the world we need .
This is a question we often ask .
How does this work ?
We need a world - life world , and everyone is able to have <unk> life , not just for the privilege of privilege .
June <unk> on <unk> <unk> 's library in <unk>
In the United States , in New York , they 're going to show you <unk> , and they do n't show the paintings , because paintings of paintings are about Australia .
There 's a lot of <unk> and <unk> paintings in <unk> <unk> .
And I could n't get these images from my head or my mind .
And what I 'm afraid of is not <unk> force .
I 'm afraid of the power of power and force .
In our race , men define reality and forced others to accept reality .
The rules are often changing , but it 's always good for men who are good at the bottom of the male , and it is not the rule of the rules , but it 's the perfect part of it .
On the top , the power force is <unk> .
Women and children are poor , especially poverty .
Even the most <unk> men are used to be women and children , or boy .
I do n't have a lot of people to manipulate the <unk> of gender , revenue , race and purity .
I think the current time has been really important to change our civilization .
But if you want to really change the power of the world , it needs to engage the power of the world .
We need to make enough of the women who have power and nurturing women .
And of course , it 's a young man .
For older men , they 're not waiting for them .
I also want to have a long leg of <unk> and famous <unk> .
But if you could choose , I 'd like to have a brave heart , like <unk> . <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- <unk> and <unk> alike .
I want to make the world better .
It 's not just that negative , but it 's changing .
Why do n't you do that ? This is what it can do . Look at this , full of knowledge , <unk> and technology .
So let 's get out of a couple of days , and we 're starting to do a lot of <unk> with our passion .
Thank you .

In one of the big cities in London , it 's 3,000 million people per day , but these are the food that come out ?
cities , culture , food , global issues
<unk>
Carolyn <unk> : How food shapes us
How do you feed a city ?
This is one of the major problems that we 've ever seen .
But very few people ask this question .
And we went into the shops , and when we walked into our stores , or a hour later , we came up with the <unk> of the theater , so we had a lot of food waiting for us .
And yet , when you think about each day , in a Japanese city in London , it 's going to produce enough food storage , trade , cook , cooking , feed , eat the same city every day .
We live in the city of food every day , like the most natural thing on the world , and we forget that we 're going to eat , so we need to feed the natural environment , as our ancestors depend on nature .
And as we become more <unk> to the city , increasingly , more natural nature is becoming the <unk> of the fact that Brazil is <unk> by Brazil , the removal of Brazil are <unk> for the food of food .
These particular scenes are very rarely seen .
There are more and more things that are not going to depend on our food .
And as we get closer to the city , we have a lot of meat in the cities , and the world has the meat , so there 's a third of the food that 's going to feed the animal , rather than feed us .
And even three times more worth of food is actually 10 times a year to feed one person , if you raise food from eating animal food .
This is a more important problem .
By 2050 , there are tens of thousands of people who live in cities .
<unk> is also going to require twice as much meat as it is .
So the consumption of <unk> and <unk> is evolving .
This brings to a very big problem .
It 's a population of 1.3 billion people who are feeding over .
This is a big problem . If we 're working on this , we probably ca n't be solved in 2050 .
There 's a quarter - year - old forest that arises every year in <unk> .
Even at the same time , we 've lost the <unk> of <unk> , because <unk> or <unk> .
We do n't have fossil fuels .
In Europe , we need 10 <unk> of energy to create a food for us .
And despite the food we 've spent a lot of effort , we do n't have to do it .
Half of the food has been rejected in the U.S.
And finally , in the last time , we will not raise our planet .
Our 10 billion people are obese , and we 're hungry than we are .
There 's no problem .
When you find the global food of the world , it 's just <unk> by <unk> , and this is really scary .
As we move cities , the world is getting <unk> in the West .
If we look at the future , it 's not sustainable .
How do we go here ?
More importantly , what should we do ?
And the answer to that is that , first of all , I want to say that in about a decade ago , the beginning of this process is the area of the old Middle East in the ancient Middle East .
Because you can see it <unk> .
And it 's also enormous .
In this case , about two million years ago , there are almost two great things about agriculture and urbanization , almost at the same time .
It 's not accident because agriculture and cities are equal . They require each other .
And because of our ancient ancestors , the first time we had enough to produce enough food and <unk> , and that helped them live long longer .
If we look at it , we can see that they 're alive .
They 're in the area of the land , and it 's based on a large amount of <unk> , like this one in front of a temple , in fact , that they 're very effective , <unk> the center , the <unk> .
And because of these <unk> , the <unk> collect these food , <unk> and <unk> the food that they do n't eat .
So the spirit of the city , <unk> life , is used for food and <unk> , and keeps the life in the cities .
In fact , every city is so similar .
And of course , it 's not all the small cities .
So , for example , there are about 100 million people who have been at the top of a century .
So how do cities sustain electricity ?
In my eye , I called the " ancient <unk> Road . "
And basically , there 's a path to the sea , so that it 's going to spread from very far , and it 's possible to spread from food .
This is the only way to do it in ancient , because <unk> is very difficult to be bad at it .
And food is fast .
So <unk> is usually the same country , like <unk> and Europe , just to get their food <unk> .
Indeed , in fact , you can transform the empire of the empires to understand a long - term swimmer .
In fact , I love this truth . I have to argue in a period of time , and I think this is very special .
So the <unk> form itself in his own <unk> .
But there 's another interesting thing about the world .
If we look at the map of the London London House , we can see that crops come from the bottom of a map .
Because it 's because market is in southern cities .
And the way the path comes from there is also the main <unk> of the poorest market .
If we look at one of the names of a street street , you can understand about 350 years earlier .
This is the same thing that 's used for fish .
<unk> , of course , comes out of the river .
<unk> is the famous selling fish market in London since 1980 .
This is special , really , when you think about it .
Everybody 's catching up here , like the <unk> of the temple , and there 's Marc <unk> and <unk> .
This is one of the things that happens in the city of food , when a food is in a city , and it 's very difficult to be dumped .
So meat is a very different story because animals depend on cities .
So a lot of meat in London consumption from London comes from <unk> and <unk> .
And when they come up to the city , this is why it 's going to make a very famous meat market in London , right here .
The birds came from the East coast to the east coast .
And I feel like a weather player and the birds are filled with toes , and they 're surrounded by smaller feet .
And then when they landed in the East coast , it was places where they were sold , and that was the reason that <unk> were called " <unk> <unk> . "
In fact , if you look at a map of any city , you can see how food comes into the city .
In fact , you can see how food is based on the name of a city , and you 'll see a lot of clues .
On the Friday corner , it was a place where the <unk> was in Friday .
But you have to imagine that there are food everywhere .
Because the streets and the public areas are the only place for food .
If you look at the Grand Canyon of <unk> , you 'll notice that it 's hard to live in this city , and not knowing that food emerges .
In fact , when you 're eating lunch , you 'll hear it 's going to hear the maggots in the first three years .
So obviously , he 's a very organic city in organic space .
But 10 years later , everything changes .
This is the shot of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And you can see that some of these early bears are pigs and <unk> bears .
<unk> , animals stop into the market .
They were buried in the village .
And they went through the city to the city .
And these changes everything .
First of all , he 's going to make the city growth , which is possible to become a city or a form of size and shape .
The cities of the city have been <unk> by <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
Suddenly , they <unk> from <unk> forces .
And you can look at the map of the London London , where it 's going to be a little bit of a lot of <unk> from the market to market , and the way it goes into the marketplace is to become a huge amount of luxury access to the transit , which is <unk> , whether they 're <unk> or not .
And of course , this is just the beginning of the car , and it 's really the answer to the destination .
This is the end of the city , <unk> from the natural constraints of nature .
This type of city does n't have the taste of the city , of course , because no one would want to walk out of this big place .
In fact , they 're all open up to buy food for food to the Arctic , and it 's worth a week to think about how to plan to think about these food .
This time , food and cities , completely changed .
This is the most cool place for food to food .
<unk> food is a social activity .
Now it 's all <unk> .
We need cooking now , and we just need stem cells or some chicken eggs , when we 're doing cake cake .
We 're not going to forget about the food that we can eat .
We 're just reading the use of <unk> .
We do n't have the values of food , and we should n't believe it .
We even worry about it .
From the way , it becomes a waste of waste .
Now the irony is that they 're most famous , they make life <unk> , and it makes it more complex .
Because it 's a new city of free cities , but they 're not connected to people who are <unk> .
And also , they 're going to depend on this system , and that system is <unk> .
So , what should we do ?
This is n't a new problem .
500 years ago , <unk> Moore asked himself .
This is his book , " <unk> <unk> . "
And it 's a six - year - old <unk> , and if you 're familiar with it , you 'll see that all of you are going to grow out of all sorts of things , or in your yard , growing up in their yard -- and then there 's the <unk> of the polar bear and so on .
I think you might like to say that food is the foundation of <unk> <unk> , despite Moore 's Law .
There 's a very famous <unk> , a famous utopian <unk> from <unk> Howard .
Similarly , the same idea is that a range of two - and - a - half years of <unk> <unk> were swallowed by the end of the road .
And of course , food is called <unk> , in his version .
These <unk> cities are , but there 's no relationship with vision .
This is the idea of conflict to the utopian idea because they 're utopian utopian .
In fact , one word of <unk> is a word for Thomas Moore who uses <unk> .
It seems a joke , because it 's two <unk> in the Greek .
And he describes a good place , and you can also discriminate .
Because he 's a ideal . One vision . We ca n't have it .
And I think that this is an idea to think about human beings , and it 's not very useful .
So I proposed another concept called " <unk> , " which is food .
I believe we live in " <unk> . "
This is the world that is affected by the food effect , and it 's the fact that food is going to become a very powerful tool , a tool that 's a good tool to create this world .
What happens if you do that ?
That 's what I think .
I made this picture because the <unk> looked beautiful .
Anyway , eating the food is the reflection of the family 's life , which is <unk> , and you spend time on this .
This is food in our society .
But that 's exactly what the people are .
And he could also be a man .
These are people who think about food , and they think they 're going to see a bunch of lettuces .
We need this person . We 're all the whole .
Because if you do n't have that , it will not happen .
I chose this because this photo shows a man who bought the blood vessels .
But the whole thing , the entire poorest , is local production .
And he 's large , and it 's new .
This is part of the city of civic life .
Because there 's no place where you 're not going to grow the food where food is part of the landscape , and he 's not just a medical product from the dark .
<unk> cow .
Take the <unk> of the soil .
That makes everything wider .
This is a collective plan that I 've been doing recently recently .
In this greenhouse , kids learn about food , and they depend on their own food .
This is a dish called Kevin , and he might belong to a child named Kevin . I 'm not sure .
But nonetheless , this project is <unk> , because they 're trying to retool our relationship with nature .
So , <unk> , it 's another idea .
Basically , we do n't believe in some small places .
Next step is to connect them from the view of the food .
And if we do that , the city will not be an <unk> , like now .
We 're going to make cities as part of the city , in this kind of structure , with a kind of a symbiotic approach .
But it 's not a big theory , because we do n't need this kind of stuff .
We need to think more about community , so that 's very appropriate to make a statement .
We need to rethink how food shapes our lives .
I know the best way to do this is the paintings of the <unk> .
He 's a " <unk> " ritual of <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> the relationship between the city and the villages .
I think it 's very clear that he wants to <unk> .
If you look at cities , villages are helping cities .
I want you all to think about what 's going on in front of the world , if you have a picture of what 's going on .
" The <unk> of <unk> " is what it would look like .
Because I believe this is an important problem .
One problem we have to ask is a question that we need to do immediately .
We know that things are going to determine us .
So we also learned that our food decided to determine the world .
And if we look at this idea , we can use food as a powerful tool to re - engineer the world .
Thank you very much .

When it comes to the first week of <unk> , <unk> Armstrong will take a role in the role of the 21st century , and she says , " Religion 's going to make us <unk> ?
God , TED Prize , global issues , politics , religion , productivity , violence
<unk>
<unk> Armstrong : Re - <unk>
A few years ago , I always feel frustrated because of the religious historian , and I 've recognized the major religion in the world .
Each religion has a special version of their own <unk> .
Sometimes from a positive , it 's -- " <unk> . "
And the important thing is , from the opposite , " It 's all impossible . "
If you look at your heart . Seek out what makes you miserable , and in any circumstances , they 're not going to put this pain into others .
And people are doing compassion , not only because it sounds great , but it works .
And people found that when they obey <unk> , as <unk> said , it 's not just a day to do a good day , and then you 're going to get back to the <unk> of the day . When you sit down every day and you get rid of it , you can get out of it every day .
And so you can go into this , called God , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Some of the things we know about self - reflection .
But you know that most of the time you do n't know , this is the core of religion .
Because some of the exceptions in the world , when religious people are stuck together , religious leaders are <unk> , and they 're arguing about <unk> or <unk> and <unk> .
People do n't have <unk> .
And sometimes , when I talk to a lot of religious people , I notice that their face often <unk> <unk> , because people often do n't feel right .
That 's certainly the purpose of <unk> .
Why are I grateful for TED ?
Because the TED soft force brings me into the book of books , to bring me to the 21st century , and let me be able to talk to more .
Because I did .
If we do n't try to do that in the world , then we can do all of those people , whether they are , who are just as important as us , and I doubt if we 're going to bring this world to the next generation .
One of the most powerful tasks we do today is to build a global society , as I say , in this socio - society .
And religious faith is supposed to be part of the problem .
And of course , it 's not just religious people who believe it is .
The <unk> came from this . This is the assumption that <unk> <unk> will be <unk> with other people .
In my opinion , we have a choice .
We can be <unk> , or <unk> the aspect of our faith , whether it 's going to go back to the age of the <unk> era , and when he 's born , he is born in a liberal period of time , when she 's elected the whole <unk> of Judaism , who says , " <unk> <unk> . "
This is the whole thing . Everything else is <unk> . "
<unk> and early <unk> are telling you a little bit about the <unk> that explains that <unk> or <unk> is <unk> .
We need to age that kind of spiritual .
It does n't happen to us .
We have to make it happen , and we can do the modern art technique of TED .
I 've got all sorts of answers from my partners , which makes me very excited .
In Singapore , there 's a group of group who talked about the <unk> of compassion to prevent Singapore from Singapore .
The exhibition will draw a art exhibition , and the great painter will bring people , the generation of people who are willing to be compassionate , show them to the art .
Europe and Muslims are working on all sorts of different kinds of parties and <unk> , discussing Islam and other religions .
But we ca n't just do it just with <unk> . It ca n't be just like this .
<unk> education is our wrong place . It cares about those <unk> <unk> .
The religious education always has to point out what 's going on .
I 'm going to stop doing that .
I want to do two things with my partners -- nurturing <unk> and <unk> thinking about compassion .
We 're going to teach you , because we 're from compassion .
And people often think it 's a very simple thought .
Of course you ca n't find compassion , of course , if you just think about it just .
You have to be very large .
I want the media to be involved in , because the world is critical to the <unk> of the people who are trying to take the other ones you want to see each other .
This is the same strategy for <unk> .
I want young people to know that rich is dynamic and challenging .
And also also allowing them to see that it needs a <unk> wisdom , not just a mere <unk> .
I want to talk about the romantic notion of romantic romantic imagination to others .
Perhaps the most important thing is , to inspire the sensitivity of <unk> , because people have this reputation , whether they 've got this jar , or they have no faith , they do n't have a sense of religion , and they 're in the politics of religious leadership , political leaders .
Because we can change the world , because we have this ability .
I never imagined the <unk> to the Web .
I still live in the old world , and with a bunch of studies of researchers who have been involved in <unk> .
But what TED celebrates is a new way to think about the way I think and expression .
Because that is the magic of TED .
This <unk> , all of the professionals , if we can do it together , can change the world .
And of course , some of the time is it seems to be <unk> .
But I 'd like to say a word for a British writer from Oxford , and I 'm not saying that he 's a C - author who is C.
But he was very deeply deeply in my head , when I was a little girl , I told my story .
This man comes from his book " Four " .
And he said , he does n't tell the love of love . When two people look at each other , it 's fascinating to look at each other .
And then he 's going to do this with the leopard <unk> , and it 's all about a goal .
We do n't need to drink each other , but you can be good friends .
I ca n't wait .
And I strongly think that the <unk> of the small <unk> , when the people who have different faiths come together , worked together in a common purpose .
We learned to paste .
We learned that other people live and understand each other .
Thank you very much .

So , in order to do this , David <unk> , who did n't have a long - ever - <unk> experience , and even a little bit of <unk> . Please listen to him .
<unk> , art , arts , book , cities , communication , culture , design , entertainment , humor , storytelling
<unk>
David <unk> .
I draw things for things .
Sometimes they do n't understand what they 're doing .
And you 'd like to use <unk> even in the middle of the <unk> , and maybe I said , I 'm going to be surprised : I 've made two days of it , but it 's a second two weeks to make the computers and the advertisers want to cooperate .
And who knows what the <unk> process is ?
I 've never been able to read it all the time , but it 's not going to get out of the past , or how it is , because at the same time they 're doing a terrible remind , it does n't have to have a bad illustration at every time .
I can talk about my work , but it seems to be more appropriate , and it looks like I 'm concerned about what I care about .
I decided to choose that one .
My subject is <unk> .
Why ?
This is the building that I read at the <unk> Institute of Design in the late 60s .
That 's great luck : <unk> Lincoln , which is <unk> . This changed my life .
What 's really important is that it 's going to change the lives of my school in the next two days -- driving to school .
I 'm 60 years old , and sometimes the book books in the ' 60s is a funny time , <unk> it . In <unk> , it 's extraordinary . It 's a very glamorous place .
Once it 's a little bit of opportunity , I 'm going to do something about it , or whatever it is .
And I 'll show you something .
I hope people trust me .
That 's the job of the <unk> <unk> .
So let 's look at some of the paintings .
I 've done a lot of the paintings of <unk> .
<unk> , I 'm going to go back and look at this .
And those different materials , <unk> , period , notice all sorts of details .
I 'm going to show you that maybe they have to explain my experience and feel what I feel like .
Some of these little details are <unk> .
<unk> is an amazing city .
And what I 'd like to do here is to look at the <unk> of <unk> ice , and all of a sudden , a huge amount of time , <unk> , the ice ceiling -- these islands are overwhelming .
Maybe people make it organic .
The new <unk> of the old and ancient <unk> , which seems to be a map of what you 're going to discover in your mind -- usually the blue , especially in summer -- particularly in the summer .
So , how do I get readers to get readers ?
And that 's what I want to share with you , " What 's the <unk> that I feel ?
This is some of the <unk> of <unk> .
You know , you do n't know if you 're not familiar with the road .
This is the map of <unk> -- and I started thinking about this map , and maybe a little leopard picks up my favorite <unk> .
This line here , I 've got a little scooter .
<unk> goes down a piece of water , and this painting is coming to the past .
<unk> is a story that can be a <unk> of some human nature .
Maybe I 'm going to reject the map of this map , which is the part of the <unk> that I love , and it 's like a lot of shops in the shops , so I 'll explain the difference between <unk> .
It looks like a railway station .
But even though I started painting , it was n't the first thing I did , I was a little bit <unk> .
And finally , I found that there was no way to rely on how to <unk> attention to the <unk> .
There was a lot of fun .
And so I thought , I 'm going to create a design for <unk> <unk> .
But one of the ideas that came out of that was that he was sitting in different planes , and it 's going to move through a different <unk> .
For example , you 're on the top of the helicopter .
Or the photos of all sorts of things are <unk> in the motorcycle , or if you look at the <unk> , you can be able to enjoy these beautiful detectors and <unk> things .
Anyway , I went back to this idea .
Finding the <unk> .
He found a big amount of paper that he designed with it , using it to make a <unk> and <unk> .
The ship breaks down or down and down , or on the bottom , and it 's acting like a ceiling -- <unk> -- no ceiling .
It 's not to tell you about 11 <unk> , but you can do it with a thousand <unk> or a <unk> <unk> with the <unk> -- if you 're happy .
This is <unk> , she had a <unk> . She bought a license , and she was working on the size of the wing , where she 's going to get rid of the balloon .
She took out of the air in Spain .
We 've got a tutor .
That 's the end of the ice , and the river goes horribly .
And what 's lucky is that the path is <unk> to the Hewlett - Packard <unk> , where you know about the diameter of the ship , and as you can see here , she 's starting to read the story of <unk> -- and she starts reading a story about <unk> <unk> .
This is a scene that allows me to draw the structures of Hewlett - Packard <unk> , which is that a lot of houses are extremely high and extremely glamorous , and it 's a very glamorous place to land -- the whole <unk> of symmetry .
<unk> is a fantastic <unk> , and usually you see a particular girl in it .
And at the <unk> of <unk> and it 's 700 feet tall .
She 's stopped , and she 's going to get close to the <unk> .
The text of the text is <unk> , and you have to come up with the book , so you can come back from the ground and look at the angle of view and her angle , to the point where it 's going to move through the floor , which is that the scale of space is moving in the center of a sphere .
In a little bit of <unk> , it 's been taken out of some of the <unk> feet on the leg , and they 're immediately labeled with a special anvil on their point of view of what 's going on in their behavior , which is the opposite of their <unk> .
And they went to the <unk> church , and they got that structure .
She goes on to <unk> .
You saw a huge amount of people in <unk> , and it reminds her to eat lunch , she was hungry .
And they kept the flowers , soon , waiting . The dog was thrown into a basket , and they got a list of food that came into the market until the afternoon , which went back to the next day and then <unk> on the day .
I do n't want to go back to the airplane .
Unfortunately , when she <unk> up to the <unk> <unk> , she went down .
And the end of the last year is <unk> , but the process has gone down and you 're looking at it .
They decided that they were n't going to get rid of it , and they wanted to get somewhere else .
And then finally found a little bit about the <unk> , and it 's a really nice thing to do with <unk> .
And it was a big <unk> of <unk> , and they were on the verge of the <unk> .
And then you 've got <unk> , and they 're going to get rid of the <unk> cycle , <unk> a <unk> from a swimming chamber , to look at the pyramid of <unk> <unk> .
And the trouble for that is that they 've got a little bit close -- it 's just going to be careful when they 're going up to the <unk> .
And her little story is going to be <unk> .
The other person , <unk> <unk> , is a <unk> ; he does n't need to go to work .
She 's 12 years old .
And he went down , and he was walking on the kitchen , the <unk> church , <unk> <unk> , came out of the corner of <unk> . Every time she was working on the street .
And I hope that this is the speed of this guy 's speed -- and it 's going to be able to look at the image , because there 's all the words on the bottom there .
And he went on , and he was thrown down a little bit of a <unk> leopard <unk> <unk> in two days without <unk> his <unk> to the hotel .
<unk> <unk> : Come on .
Yves abuse .
And everything he sees is just a little bit of relationships from the leopard , but it 's still going to go and work .
<unk> <unk> a little scaffolding -- and they 're still still going to preserve the difference between the individual : people are <unk> and protected and protect the needs of the city , and keep growing the demand for a different era .
And you 're looking at his <unk> <unk> , and he 's done a little bit about the <unk> .
We found that <unk> <unk> is a driver 's license , and if you sit down to 64 <unk> , you know about the <unk> of <unk> .
And finally , <unk> -- his apartments was in the upper left .
He 's in front of his desk tonight tonight and he 's going to talk to him about 40 years .
And he <unk> the candle , and he 's got antennae thinking about where it is .
But he does n't feel so good .
<unk> -- he 's called <unk> .
And he went down to the <unk> , and he was in love with <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> : he 's a lot of entertainment -- it 's <unk> .
And everybody knows because he 's responsible for the TV .
Everyone has his call .
And finally , he came up to the door .
Went into the yard , and I talked to the edges of the <unk> , which is a little bit bad about the television that 's bad , but it 's going to be a <unk> for you , so it 's going to be <unk> .
And so he goes down the basement to the building , and it 's going to go from the center of the floor , Michigan , shooting every television station , trying to figure out the question .
And he went down to the <unk> , and he ended up in the major <unk> .
You open the window , of course , <unk> <unk> on the <unk> 's television account .
And he goes down , and the problem is that it 's really happy to solve the interior .
And he solves his problems .
And the tables were <unk> , and what he was trying to do was to wait for her .
This is my first attempt to try , but it 's not enough to learn what I want to talk about .
So I thought , okay , I 'm going to pop up the hall , and then I 'll show you , you know , <unk> and <unk> , the power of the city .
And then I feel so complex . No , I 'm going to use the <unk> of my favorite <unk> and keep the size of the sizes of <unk> , and you can see the stars and <unk> the pyramid and there 's this <unk> <unk> that 's here and so on .
And this painting is a painting . I think maybe it 's time to get <unk> <unk> .
And actually you 're looking at a little bit of <unk> and <unk> , and it 's also <unk> .
And there are two blue <unk> of <unk> , like <unk> <unk> .
And I realized , well , what am I doing ?
The book is not just the <unk> of information , but it 's still a range of levels .
And you 've always done that -- page page , some experience , in " <unk> . "
Imagine those levels of scale , which is a range of levels -- the <unk> levels , and I think , if you take a penny of a page , it can show you that it 's going to be okay to show the level of <unk> .
Most of the <unk> walls are <unk> on the walls of a lot of centuries , which is constantly changing the building , rather than <unk> .
If I did a folded piece of paper on the left , you opened it , and you saw the <unk> organization .
For example , in <unk> , you can see the importance of the window , because the bad people are approaching , or whatever it is .
These changes are actually buried below the surface .
And I 'm just going to figure out what 's going on at the top of the building .
But what 's more important is that this can also tell you that there are some huge amount of <unk> in the corner of the building -- and the <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- they 're more popular .
So the name is a little 3D .
And I can put you out of a <unk> downtown , and I 'm going to put it down in the street , <unk> it , fold it up , folding it -- and if you like to read this , you might have heard about it .
And the <unk> <unk> in the book is when you 're in a restaurant .
I do n't have a much more complex thing to do that , and it 's the most complex thing that 's going on .
But then I thought , I might be very simple .
So we 're going to look at a million <unk> in the hotel .
This is an entirely <unk> book .
I 'm going to turn the book to the whole book if I just danced and look at the <unk> of <unk> , and it 's like looking down on the hall .
And if I did a direction of <unk> , we would look at the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
There is no folding , no -- it 's just a directory of it .
And I think this is a good thing to do , to try to figure out even with the folding page .
So we came up with a million books in the house , and it unfolds .
And I think I might get out of the road , and it 's just <unk> .
So I went back to the story , and if I want to focus on somebody who 's focused on your book , you learn something good about it , and it 's a good way to learn .
Suddenly , " The Vagina tours " is a good news .
If this is a bird , if you go home , it 's called " <unk> <unk> . "
But it 's a traveling trip .
This is the title of the headline , which is that it 's going to be a stepping into the <unk> of what I love to love .
This is the pigeon of the church .
One day , a little bit of the art , and the General was doing what was going to be -- and back to the <unk> scaffolding and the green <unk> , it could n't go home .
It 's <unk> <unk> . So it has to be done . This gives me the opportunity to draw what I love .
But maybe it 's going to go back and family -- it does n't have to be good . This is the pigeon .
And I thought , well , it 's a bit of a guy who 's going to be participating .
And I 've been fascinated by this <unk> , which is used to take care of chronic tomato sauce .
And he was looking at them , and the dangerous place for the <unk> , the polar House and his sister , learned to do it in lunch when he did it .
And it turns out that the <unk> people have <unk> with <unk> .
Unfortunately , the man was sick , very sick .
And he was teaching the police to his name .
They did n't see him when he went to him . He lived in a little <unk> on a small <unk> .
And he finally came up with a lot of spiritual <unk> on the temple , and all the critics waiting for him , as " Red Red balloon , " and they took him flying on his head .
And every time he was in the past -- I forgot to say that when I was dead , he sent it to a <unk> outside .
In the old tradition of <unk> , dead people died in a place .
It 's a really happy story .
Now this book progress .
Anyway , I think I 've figured out what it is , if it does n't work , it 's called " <unk> , " and I hope the title is a little bit better .
And it really made a lot of money for me to make a title page .
This page of this page is <unk> the answer to me : This is a story of a young woman who gave a letter to a son -- she lives in the Rift Valley -- and she 's living with a person in <unk> .
And <unk> goes through the road to fly around .
You can see the <unk> , the payload and everything .
If you see that red line , that 's the ice trajectory trajectory , you do n't see the red side , you 're the pigeon .
And it makes the reader that the readers need to be very , very practical , like this .
There 's a <unk> in the <unk> -- even if you 've never gone to this recently , it 's all familiar .
A little bit weird .
This is one of the other lawyers who did n't do anything else : it picked up a <unk> road . This design was used for four <unk> <unk> .
So we put on the big <unk> week , flying the Greek and the sea <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to the sea .
And that 's almost the <unk> of the ice , which is <unk> , and it 's made of big rocks .
And then we looked at the wheelchairs .
And I 'm happy to show my students because it 's completely <unk> -- putting all the <unk> in <unk> .
And I think the only important paradox is that when you look at it , you 've succeeded .
But if you find out where you lose a little bit on Mars , there 's something else -- it 's going to run in the <unk> area .
And the dove came up to the <unk> , and there was no competition in the face of the African train , and there was no competition when it was in the face .
This is me in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I came up with a bunch of different pieces of mine . Peace carries a part of the song , and she did n't feel like it was <unk> .
If you want to look at peace , the Virgin Mary -- like this book , it 's very flexible -- it is very convenient to get rid of it .
Across the <unk> , you can see the effects of ice in the red line .
And then the dove fell to the <unk> of the Middle East -- <unk> <unk> -- and then it opened up -- how many of you forgot -- the ice <unk> down the hill , and we 've seen it here . This is the four stars in the hotel , so it 's four and a half feet long .
We can do it in the <unk> speed , because it does n't need to worry about gravity , and it 's a picture of what it can do .
When the ice is Christ , the bird <unk> -- it 's so tempting to mimic this building .
<unk> a wall on the top of the wall , and it 's filled with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which is beautiful .
And then we came up with the <unk> of <unk> , which was the destination .
The dove passes through the yard , fly into the windows , flying on the window , and there 's a guy on a board playing playing .
And he 's on the pigeon legs . He 's like this .
And what we saw was that the <unk> on the board is actually the trajectory of the bird flight , and the red side of the red bone is <unk> <unk> .
If you want to understand more , to give you a little bit of the <unk> of your virtual <unk> .
Thank you very much .

MIT researcher <unk> talks about self - oppositional research -- an idea of building things , and we can create our materials , very similar steps of DNA , which is a very early early stage ; we 've shown three of the projects that we 're going to see in the project .
design , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : Can we make something ?
I want to show you the way that we do things .
And I think very quickly that our buildings are allowing us to self - assemble and self - mimicry and self - repair .
So I 'm going to show you what I think mechanism , and then I compare it to some natural systems .
So in the current building , we have fashion -- two and a half years of time , 50 million parts of the population , and it 's very complex , using a new technology , with the same technology in the goggles .
We have exciting machines , we can bring us into space -- five years , two million .
But on the other hand , if you look at the natural system , we have two two - year - old proteins , and we can fold it in a six - hour period of DNA .
This is the complexity of our natural system , but they 're very efficient , much more efficient than anything we can build .
They 're more efficient in energy .
They 're very <unk> .
They can self - repair themselves .
It 's a very glamorous thing about natural systems .
If we can convert it to our buildings , then we do a lot of potential .
I think the key is self - assembly .
And if we want to use our own body environment , I think there are four key things that are important .
The first is , we need to <unk> all of the complexity that we 're going to build -- our buildings and the machine .
We need to lock them into a simple database -- essentially our buildings operate .
And then we need a smaller part of this , which allows us to accept this <unk> and <unk> .
We need a certain amount of energy to engineer , to make sure that these parts can fold it .
We need a certain amount of <unk> to make sure we 're going to build our success .
And so I 'm going to show you some of my colleagues who are doing this kind of self - assembly project that I 'm working with .
The two two projects are <unk> and <unk> .
These are the ones that are large and large - <unk> proteins -- eight feet long , 12 feet long .
They 're embedded in <unk> .
You have to <unk> the way that you 're going to make a series of things -- more than 120 degrees centigrade , zero degrees , less or less , that 's 12 degrees of <unk> , and it 's a whole range of other things , or , you know , a set of ways of doing this .
Every element of each element -- for example , 120 percent of the time , it rotates , whether it 's spinning , and then <unk> the database , and putting it into the neighbor . "
There are many brilliant scientists , engineers , designers work for this project .
And I think this project really is really , really <unk> ?
I mean , tens of thousands of dollars to build this eight feet to build this eight feet .
Can we increase it ? Are we really embedded in each one ?
The next question is to look at <unk> , or passively trying to make <unk> a mild <unk> .
But it goes over the stage , trying to figure it out .
It 's basically the foundation of most of the calculations , the digital <unk> , the digital logic , directly from all parts .
This is <unk> .
And each of those types of <unk> has a <unk> , two input in the door .
One of them is from users , like you 're building structures .
And one of the other ones that came up with was the first one in the first time .
And then it would give you three dimensions .
That means that users are <unk> building structures .
It 's based on what you 've done before .
It 's starting to move in three dimensions .
Look at <unk> , [ One ] one , one type of input is zero .
On the right , [ zero ] <unk> , zero - zero input .
So this real definition is that the structure of our structure now has the blueprint to build .
And so information about what 's going to be built is all embedded .
That means that we have some form of self replication .
In this case , I call myself self - mimicry , because your structure has precise blueprint .
If you have a mistake , you can replace a part .
All local information is embedded , and tell you how to fix it .
So you have something that can climb , and it 's a <unk> .
It 's directly <unk> ; it does n't have the interior .
And the final project I 'm going to show you is called <unk> <unk> , which is the most exciting example of the <unk> system that we 're seeing now .
It 's got <unk> and rapid <unk> that make it completely passive .
And basically you have components .
Each element is the same , and they 're <unk> .
Each chains , or every element , wants to be <unk> or <unk> .
If you want to manage the soil , you need to program it .
It 's going to tell every unit that is left or close to the left .
And when you look at this plate , it folds up to the structure of it , which you call it -- so that 's a <unk> , two - and - a - half <unk> .
Basically , you can calculate it in three dimensions -- or three , two - thirds , which is completely passive .
So what do we predict the future ?
And I think this is telling us that these are our structures in our bodies , our buildings and our ability to replicate , self - replicating possibility .
There 's a new range of <unk> .
And you can get a new possibility of computation .
We 'll have space computation .
Imagine our buildings , bridges , machines , all kinds of structures .
And how amazing it is and the ability to design , the possibilities of the new design .
This is a very exciting potential .
And I think these are the projects I 'm going to show you about the future , and if we 're dealing with a new world of self - assembly , we have these new technologies .
Thank you .
<unk>
We 've got out the moon , we 've mapped continents , and we even have to go to the sea -- twice , what 's going to be the next generation to explore ?
biodiversity , exploration , microbiology , science
<unk>
Nathan Wolfe : What about exploring ?
I went to <unk> recently .
And I went there to get a explorers for 20 century , Roy <unk> .
When he was in the American Museum of Natural History , <unk> led a series of exploration exploration , for example , in here .
He 's a great film .
And he said that it was the archetype of the <unk> architect .
When I was in <unk> , I had a couple of classes at the <unk> .
I want to tell you , if there 's a little bit more hard to talk about the TED conference , that 's trying to keep their attention to a thousand - year - olds , and keep 45 minutes .
<unk> .
And after I finished , they asked a lot of problems , but there was a little bit of a forget .
And a little girl stood up and said , " Where are we going to explore ? "
And I think most of the concepts that we have , that 's what 's going on in the world , and our next generation should be in space or the oceans to look at things that are worth exploring .
But is that true ?
Is n't that important where we 're exploring this planet ?
And this led me to one of the most <unk> of <unk> of biology .
He 's a very unknown world , and Martin <unk> William <unk> .
And the reason for <unk> was to find the <unk> of <unk> .
And he took a bunch of <unk> , and then he came up with these little <unk> to the filter than a surface .
And he came up with a conclusion , and the rest of them had to have something that was more known than the most famous known life form -- bacteria , small .
And he gives this mysterious thing .
It 's called " <unk> " in Latin Africa .
After the discovery , releasing a new world for us .
We now know that the <unk> of germs on our planet are far more relevant than all of the other ones on the planet .
And obviously there 's been a tremendous amount of use of germs in this world -- <unk> , <unk> epidemic -- we know that most of them are infected by germs .
And it 's not about 500 years of discovery .
This is about 100 years ago .
And that means that when the cars have already emerged , we do n't know that most of the organisms on our planet are <unk> .
We have a great tool right now to help us explore the world , like gene depth , which allows us to not just stay in the surface of a particular human genome , but the whole genome of the entire genome -- and we 're inside the species , and the genetic information that we have in our bodies .
We can use these techniques to study from the atmosphere to the skin .
And in my own institutions , we 're going to do this because of the cause of obesity , which we do n't know .
Let 's give you a little bit of how to do this , and imagine it 's going to take a <unk> from each person .
We often do things like this , to look for <unk> viruses like <unk> flu .
What we saw was a huge amount of information .
If we start to look at these genetic behavior , we 'll see a lot of information , of course , but so many of the human genes , the information of bacteria and viruses , and most of them are completely discarded .
But we 've also seen something very , very surprising .
When we start studying these information , we 'll find that your nose is 20 percent of the information that we 've seen -- any plants , animal , bacteria or bacteria , all <unk> .
We all know nothing about this .
There 's a little study of people who are in this data , called these information <unk> .
We know that the <unk> of these creatures -- it seems to be the unknown continent .
And the number of times .
If you think you have 20 percent of the information in your nose , there 's a lot of biology , and if you look at your stem , it 's about 40 to 50 percent organisms .
Even in smaller blood vessels , it 's about two percent of the information that is dark -- no matter whether it can be <unk> , you ca n't get anything different from us .
We think it 's a human thing .
These sorts of <unk> tools are very new .
But when they become more precise , we think that information is a new life , or at least one part of life is alive .
Even if the assumptions of <unk> - to - vary assumptions are very , very excited , it 's a very <unk> possibility : that 's where it is hidden in this life , there is a synthesis of life that does n't have been recognized .
When we explore these <unk> A , we might find a new life , like Kim <unk> , fundamentally changing our understanding of biology .
This may be the reason for me to recognize some of the cancers that we do n't know if we 're not familiar with cancer , or create a new tool of <unk> .
And I 'm happy to announce that , with my Stanford , <unk> and San Jose , we 're beginning to start a new initiative to explore the existence of life directly to looking for new life .
About 100 years ago , people do n't know the existence of the virus , the life forms that we have on our planet .
A hundred years later , humans might be surprised with a new form of life that we 've never seen before .
Yeah , we might have made the map of all the continents on the planet , and we may have found that all of the germs in the world , but it does n't mean that there 's no exploration on Earth .
<unk> people to the next generation of people like him , like this girl who 's in the <unk> girl in <unk> .
And I think that if I summarize that lesson for us , it 's about : Do n't suppose we think about what 's going on now .
At any area where you 're chosen to explore the dark matter .
The unknown thing is that they 're just waiting for human exploration .
Thank you .
<unk>
<unk> scientist is going to meet the Bible , and it 's about a more <unk> subject to a better subject : human beings . He suggests , solve the world 's first step is to admit that we need a problem to solve problems .
climate change , cosmos , culture , environment , global issues , physics , science , technology , universe
<unk> .
David <unk> tells us in the universe .
<unk> asked us to do the opposite .
So I 'm going to try to get it to you , but I want to start with you .
The first thing , actually , is that it 's a historical history .
This is the Earth , or our solar system , and our environment , our environmental , a unique sense of being able to preserve our evolution , whether we understand what we know about the future , as we 've heard about it .
This idea has a dramatic name today : <unk> Earth .
In this idea , <unk> , the universe is not glamorous , and it 's all about what we live in .
We have only one chance : if we 're going to <unk> our <unk> bad .
And the second thing that you all know is that most of the people in the history of human history are actually not the center of the center .
You know , all of you know that Stephen <unk> said that we 've only existed in a typical surface of the surface , this typical planet , which is the typical star of space , and it 's a very iconic stars in the edge , and so on .
And the first thing that you all know about is that we 've got a very weak place , a unique place for the <unk> , and the second thing is to say we 're in a typical place .
And especially when you 're going to take these two things as a profound truth of life , as you have your own decision - makers , they seem to look at other conflict .
But it ca n't change them . This is the truth .
They 're wrong . They come from the second thing : <unk> . Let 's see -- this is a typical place where you see the <unk> , as you can see , if you 're looking at a wall , and a little bit of chemistry -- and that 's not typical in the universe .
And what you 're going to do is to move to the same direction , and go back and look , you 'll never see any wall or chemical <unk> -- you can see that it 's a blue planet , if you continue to see it . If you continue on the sun , the solar system and so on .
But this is not typical in the universe , because the star is in galaxies .
Most of the universes in the universe , in a typical place , not a galaxy .
So we continue on , until we came out of the galaxy , and then we went back and forth , yes , you 'll see a huge number of galaxies , it 's <unk> displays in front of us .
And we 've got over 100,000 years .
But we did n't have the typical place in the universe .
You have to go to the area where you 're going to get over 1,000 times , until you get out of the galaxies , and you get to the center of galaxies .
What would it look like ? <unk> .
What 's the typical place in the universe ?
And here , TED Fellow <unk> , <unk> the reality of space - on - space space -- the space of the galaxy .
And then you can turn the lights off .
Not accurate . It 's not perfect -- see , you see the space between the galaxy -- galaxies are completely dark , glamorous .
This space is so dark , so if you 're looking at stars from your nearest star , this star is <unk> , and when you look at it , you can barely see it .
The universe is so big and so dark .
And this is a very strong ray of <unk> <unk> that is so strong and bright , and you 're going to fold over the place of time .
But in the middle of the galaxy , it 's so deeply remote , you can hardly see it .
It was very cold -- no more than <unk> .
What does n't happen . There 's a hundred percent reduction in the Earth 's best technology on Earth . So this is a typical place where the universe is in a different place .
That 's where we live in this place .
Please , thank you .
So how do we know that distances are so much more distant than we 're familiar with , and it 's so different .
Earth -- our environment , in our form -- creates knowledge .
And what it means is , what 's going to be far more far from the place that we 've come to -- I mean , it 's starting to start with the telescope -- you 'll see things like stars .
They called it " <unk> . "
That 's what it means to look like stars . But they 're not stars .
We already know what they 're doing . Over billions of years , a galaxy 's worth of <unk> to a giant black hole .
And there 's a few power effects associated with gravity , and some of the stuff , in large <unk> forms , goes through a huge amount of space -- and I think it 's equivalent to 100 billion sun lights .
But , with this kind of <unk> physics , the physics of our human brain is very <unk> .
In this context , we ca n't live a little bit older , and when we try to describe the <unk> , language becomes incapable .
This may be a little bit like a supernova explosion , but it 's going to depend on the <unk> of millions and millions of years of energy .
But this <unk> has been so precise that billions of years , and over the other end of the universe , some chemical <unk> can be able to describe it very precisely , building and explaining , the most important thing -- and that 's what you can find .
A physical system , the brain , contains the accurate model of a physical operating system -- <unk> .
It 's not just an image , but it includes images of images , and also also the same mathematical relationships and things like that .
That 's the knowledge . If it 's not enough to make you laugh , a structure is going to continue to improve on time .
So , physics has this special property .
The object , regardless of each other , can still be able to draw the same mathematical and <unk> structures , and as long as time performance .
So we 're very different modes of chemistry . This chemical <unk> has <unk> .
And the structure of it is more <unk> to <unk> , the world 's structure , and this place , not any other place in the universe , in its interior , becomes a <unk> for the rest of its body , to the <unk> of the other universe . So , it 's a very important thing about physics , so that the physics is about the most important things about physical worlds .
So the system -- our environmental , how do we get this special relationship to the universe ?
One of the right points in <unk> <unk> -- I mean , this is right , but it 's wrong . One thing is that it does n't have any special physics ; it is n't glamorous . It 's all about three things .
One of the things that is the matter of matter , because the growth of knowledge is a form of <unk> , which requires computational , computation needs -- the knowledge that does n't need ordinary materials to produce computers .
We also need energy to create computers , most importantly , to make the job of how we find knowledge .
And the third thing , the <unk> , is the same thing that 's in open knowledge and explains the same thing .
Our environment is full of evidence .
But we often forget tests -- for example , Newton 's Earth 's planet -- about 300 years ago .
But the evidence we do is we fall in the middle of a hundred years of the Earth , and it 's going to fall over the next hundred years , and so on .
And we know that the evidence for all of science is that most of the controversies in our planet are waiting for us .
We 've got evidence of the evidence , and the material and the energy .
And in the middle of the galaxy , there are three ways of making open - open knowledge of knowledge .
As I said , there 's no , cold , dark , dangerous .
In fact , this is just another <unk> <unk> .
So imagine there 's a single layer in the space between the galaxy , and the size of our house , the solar system , in our criteria , is very empty , but it actually still contains more than <unk> .
It 's enough to build a lot of money , so , for example , <unk> space , there 's a range of scientists , and they 're participating in trying to create open knowledge .
And yet , the technology that 's going to be released from the galaxy is that it will convert it to the other elements that you can not do .
But the question is , in an understanding of the universe , if you have a physical laws of physics , what can we do about it ?
In other words , this is a question about knowledge , not about resources .
So , if we can do that , then we 're going to get the energy supply supply , because the changes will be the reactor -- evidence ?
It 's also the same thing as human senses , but what you need to do is to take a telescope , even today , and the design of the world , to see where we see here .
If you have a more powerful telescope , you 'll see stars and planets .
In those galaxies , you can do <unk> physics , understanding physics .
In the workplace , you can create particle accelerator , research particles , particle physics , chemistry , etc .
Perhaps the most challenging scientific science is the biology of biology , because it takes tens of millions of years to increase the planet .
But I have to tell you -- sorry , Richard -- but I never like to say biology , I think we can do it every million years .
So , in fact , the space of the galaxy does n't have the source of open knowledge to the knowledge of knowledge . Every single single size , anywhere in the universe , can become the same as the center of our project .
So we 're not the only place to go .
If the galaxy is able to create the openness of <unk> open - open , almost everything else can be . That 's the same Earth .
And <unk> , this is not resource , not resources , because they 're very efficient , but it 's very <unk> .
And so this <unk> <unk> , maybe -- I think it 's really bad for us to feel very glamorous , but also also let us feel the fragility of the universe , because it means that if you do n't live , we will not survive .
Just a few hundred years of a <unk> explosion , we 're all going to be dead .
A <unk> recently recently has a book about what we all know about all sorts of things about human beings , from the <unk> physics , and the most important <unk> of non - storm destruction .
And he thinks it 's only 50 percent of the probability that humans have lived in this century .
I think he 'll tell you a few minutes later .
But I think that 's not the case for the disease .
But I agree with him . We can live up , and we can do it .
But it does n't depend on the probability , but we can create knowledge .
This dangerous is not never seen before . species are <unk> .
The civilization will also have the same species of species and civilizations .
If we want to be <unk> , the only way to look at us is to take the difference between our population and other species , and all sorts of things that are very different from all the other things we 're creating with the physical laws . We create new challenges and knowledge .
So I 'm going to use this with a fight here , not because I want to propose any specific solution , but just to give me something to tell me .
This customer is global <unk> .
I 'm a physicist , but I do n't have physicists in the field , and the global <unk> , I was just a <unk> . It was a good way to be serious about authority , which was late , it was too late .
Because , if we have the best alternatives for CO2 emissions , for example , in Tokyo , the <unk> economy , and the amount of cost , it 's a disaster .
It 's not even a question of dealing with the problem , but it 's just a little bit more anti - disaster .
In the ' 70s , maybe the most advanced scientific theory tells us that industrial emissions will enable a new <unk> century , billions of people who will kill .
And this lesson for me is that I do n't understand why it does n't interfere with the public debate .
And the truth is that we ca n't read it forever , when we know there 's a disaster that will come to the end of this disaster , and do n't have a lot of controversy .
But without any accounting , or preventing principles of principles , it can help us do n't anticipate the problem .
So we need to prepare for solving problems , not just about problems .
And <unk> preventing <unk> is the fact that it 's true , but this is just what we know about harm .
If you 're swallowed by your nose , medicine does n't teach you how to cook .
If you do n't study health , it 's only about research , but it will almost almost be <unk> .
And now the entire world is in <unk> , and it 's going to make the cost of gas emissions .
And what it should do is to determine how to reduce temperature , and how it 's going to grow up to the temperature . It 's not <unk> , but it does n't work in the way that the sun has , like , in space , there 's a lot of carbon dioxide to put it out in a space that has a little amount of CO2 .
Now , these are just the edge studies .
These are the questions that humans are dealing with , and they 're not going to be <unk> .
For the problems that we 're not unconscious , the ability to <unk> -- is that it 's not the first time -- the only hope we hope , not just for solving problems , but for survival .
We should take two <unk> , and on top of the <unk> .
One of the problems that you can do is solve it .
The other one is inevitable .
Thank you .
<unk>
What could n't be done in a state of institutions ? economist Paul Paul asks a new shift : " Very special , <unk> , cities , the cities of the city .
business , culture , economics , global issues , politics
<unk>
Paul <unk> on particular : special art
So look at this image .
It brought us an incredible mystery .
These African students are doing <unk> in <unk> because they do n't have electricity .
I do n't have a couple of students , but I 've seen a student like them .
Take the case of the green shirt .
So imagine his name is <unk> .
I guess he had a cellphone .
Interestingly .
Why do n't you have opportunities for the future of a cell phone like mobile phones ?
The answer is <unk> .
It does n't make any sense of institutions to get rid of this kind of damage , the way people are going to do it in a certain sense of institutions .
What kind of organization ?
The state of this country needs to be obeying a system that requires a lot of money in the government , and in fact , it 's a very expensive amount of income , actually , to the other side of the <unk> , in terms of <unk> .
So , <unk> does n't have any resources ; there 's no incentive to drive the user .
The president wanted to change this thing .
And he 's recognized that <unk> is the possibility of <unk> , and it 's going to make a difference .
The <unk> cell phones in the <unk> are also working on institutions .
The president has already done a good job .
So he tries to change the <unk> of <unk> institutions , but from <unk> and consumer <unk> , they want to support the liberal institutions .
There is no way to do that , and it 's only impossible to stop the workforce , and it 's going to prevent it .
So , <unk> is only learning in the <unk> .
What 's really challenging is trying to find ways to change change .
How do we develop institutions ?
And I want to say , well , we can make a lot of choices , or if we give people more choices to offer leaders more .
But , you know , there are also ways of explaining .
Because you want to deliver the freedom of leadership as if you give the President of the president , the same freedom that you have to do in this economic system .
I hope you can continue to save free .
So if you only take one side , or other , you 're going to face a <unk> or a parachute .
But if we 're going to give you the freedom to be free , then it 's going to make us <unk> .
You can still use the Internet now .
And he says that if you want to see the <unk> of the state of institutions , how to look at the Earth 's home , and look at the Earth 's home space .
Notice that Asia is about Asia .
And you can see that it 's going to see the heat here , and there 's a little black hole here , like a black hole .
You do n't laugh at the <unk> of the <unk> .
What 's important is to admit that South Korea has the same system , whether it 's the law , or in terms of understanding , culture , social , values , compassion , faith .
When I did that , the <unk> North Korea made a difference between different sorts of options from different institutions .
So we can change , we , human beings , change institutions , have a better <unk> , and make it better , better or worse .
So let 's look at another area , very rapidly in the future .
This is in Haiti .
And the same population is in the dark and the poorest , and the poorest people in the world .
But these two countries and the <unk> are almost the same amount of people in the dark , or the Grand Canyon of the South , <unk> <unk> .
Haiti reminds us that we 're not going to get rid of the <unk> government .
And not completely , because governments are forced , like <unk> .
So if we want to create good policy , we ca n't always <unk> .
We need to build it .
You see , China is intense to show the potential and challenges of the challenges .
In this graph , China is the frontier of the World Trade Center .
For example , steel , printing , <unk> .
But China has never done it , at least in that period , to encourage these ideas , or a nonprofit motivation to persuade transmission to transmission .
And the Chinese continued to slow down the idea of innovation , and <unk> , and <unk> .
So in other countries , it 's developed new technologies in the developing world , and there 's a whole range of China that has been taken down to the end of the campaign .
It <unk> into a very backward country .
This graph shows new data .
It shows the percentage of the income , the <unk> of China .
<unk> , you can see it in three , three percent .
But the ' 70s had changed .
China starts developing , starting quickly .
And if you look at this map , you see the reason why China has a substantial change in China .
The most <unk> of China , you can see here , in the <unk> , you see the <unk> .
In fact , it 's a very , very small place in China , in most of the time in the 20th century , and in a lot of different areas , there 's all sorts of <unk> to the continents that are very effective from the continent .
In the late 19th century , <unk> is a million continents to find a place like <unk> , making toys .
But to improve prices , they improve progress .
<unk> is also a leaders like <unk> , and the leaders of the continent want to be able to replicate the <unk> .
But <unk> is the importance of understanding the importance of people .
So <unk> is n't just going to take the Chinese end of the face of China , and then he 's starting to use special amounts of <unk> , so that you can simulate the opportunity for the British Revolution to drive it to the people who want it .
So they 've created the four special economy of the Chinese , and they 're able to work in the city and do it very quickly .
There 's a place called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> have a <unk> company , and you have all of the iPhone that you 've all owned in China , the Chinese workforce , and those are the ones who are in charge of the Chinese , and those are the ones who are in charge of <unk> .
So in four special days , there are 14 <unk> of the city , and it 's going to end up with a lot of success in these people where people choose to choose where they choose , because the opportunity to get into the system .
So these successful successes contain consensus on the whole world .
Now this is what China demonstrated .
One : <unk> free .
Two : <unk> on the right scale .
If you want to change the village in a village , it can be very small , but it 's too small to bring millions of people to make a difference .
On the other hand , change the country , and it 's too big .
And if you want to change countries , there are some people who do n't have to pay attention to them , but they have no opportunity to refine the <unk> , and they 're trying to focus on the future , trying to focus on the future , try new opportunities to try and try to get a new opportunity to do it , trying to understand the new , future - changing opportunities for new people , attempt to make new kinds of opportunities that are going to be focused on new ways to move into a future
But as a city can offer you these opportunities to create new realms , people can pick up the new <unk> .
And so enough , enough of all , we can get a hundred million people in the new <unk> .
So I proposed that we thought of something called special <unk> .
Well , first of all , it 's been shown by all of the <unk> rules that we 're building most of the people who are building most of those .
We need to paint the infrastructure , and they 're going to build infrastructure .
You have to have a <unk> , and they 're going to teach you to fight first , especially in particular .
You need to have the family who live in their lives , and you have to raise the kids who live in education , and they 've got their businesses .
In this kind of <unk> , people will <unk> .
The cities are built .
We can also change the scale of this model .
We can do it again .
And to think about success , we need to be <unk> . We 've talked about it .
These are <unk> out in the <unk> .
We need to make people free .
It 's real to transform this model , if we can build cities on the ground .
Start with low - distance distances .
People can start to start the new <unk> , but nobody is forced to do it .
And finally , we need to give leadership to our leaders .
We need to give the leaders of the state of state - to - state cooperation , allowing us to connect different countries as well as China , to start building a <unk> swimming cycle and expand the whole China .
In contrast , the U.K. , <unk> , in the last century , is much more glamorous than any <unk> of the world , more <unk> .
So as long as we allow these partnerships , we can expand the scale of the entire world .
Sometimes this needs to be responsible for responsibility , a commitment to one nation from one country to another state of responsibility .
And I said , well , some of you might start thinking , " Well , do n't you get <unk> ? "
No . But knowing that this emotion is important , we start thinking about these emotions , and those emotions will be able to ensure that the interest of our ability to <unk> us from new ideas .
Why is n't that <unk> ?
And the result of the plague , the <unk> of <unk> -- is that it 's an alternative element of what it has to do with <unk> .
But the core equation of that is that the choice of choice is the <unk> of the leader .
This choice is essentially the antidote to <unk> and <unk> .
So let 's talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> -- he 's a <unk> leader .
There was a chance to realize that he had the opportunity to do the same thing for the Republican Desert , but Cuba did n't look like a <unk> .
There is a dark place in the South , and there 's a very special thing .
In the <unk> region , one of the forces of <unk> to the American forces for America is about twice the size of Manhattan .
Yves Prime Minister says , " Look , it 's a problem .
They had to get out .
Why do n't you ?
<unk> a special bladder .
There is new city building .
People are living .
So let 's start with a city like <unk> .
My civic is <unk> .
Somebody else does n't . But that will be the <unk> of the modern economy and modern world . "
Now , where do you try this model ?
Africa . I 've worked with leadership .
There 's a lot of people who are completely understanding that people are capable of choice .
This is a <unk> for change <unk> .
This is a new way of creating new structures , and the way people do n't have <unk> , they do n't go to depression .
And also also understood in some cases , they can make a more powerful commitment to a long period of authority , which will build the <unk> of the road , to build a lot of <unk> , and in the new cities , the promise that they 're collaborating with other countries , if they relate to another country .
And even in some ways , it 's a little bit like a <unk> account , and you 're working with the tilt account of the <unk> account .
There 's a lot of new cities in Africa that can build on these sites .
This is me running out of the window .
There are hundreds of thousands of people who have been living like this .
Let 's try and think about it rather than one , but a bunch of special actors providing millions of people , and maybe hundreds of thousands of years , we have enough enough to do enough .
If you look at the world , if we 're looking for dark <unk> , it seems that most of you are building it .
Let me tell you why this is wrong .
This is all the spheres .
Put it into the square to represent all the farms on Earth .
These are the spikes of the land , and now we have 30 million people living in cities .
If you look at the bottom of the underside , you 've got 30 billion cities on the right , and it 's only about three billion urban areas on Earth .
If we want to build cities for 10 billion people , they will look like these ones .
We 're going to spread from 30 percent to four percent of the fossil land .
By building cities , and let 's live in the villages of the village , we 're going to get a little reduction on the Earth .
If these cities are <unk> , they can be able to get people out of criminal or disease , disease and <unk> .
You can have public service , like power .
And kids can be educated .
What do we need to start ? starting to build the first special tradition and expand the scale ?
There 's a need for users .
What you can do is to write some details that can be <unk> by <unk> .
You 're not going to stop these cities out of the city .
You may not get out of the <unk> .
But you can think of what this is about to think about these problems , which is that it 's not just Canada and conservatives .
Maybe Brazil is also <unk> and Spanish . Maybe maybe Cuba wants to be a member of the Grand Canyon .
How do we <unk> the agreement ?
There is no case . But it 's really easy to solve .
How do we do that ?
In fact , Singapore and <unk> have a huge amount of cities in the garden .
And you can pay for the electromagnetic force , like police , and education , education and educational systems , to make it a place where it 's going to be a very high place to get it into a high - income place .
So for those of these building regions , the reward for this region is completely appropriate .
There 's a lot of detail like this .
How do we treat the <unk> of the iPhone , like a group of people who are able to provide them with their ability to afford their capabilities , and to make sure that it 's safe for the earthquake or hurricane .
There 's a lot of details , and some of us have been struggling with this dream of dreams that they 're going to tell you , that there 's only no way that you ca n't see the world that we can make the real world .
So let 's recap .
Why do we have a wealthy life , despite the amount of people on the planet .
We can share with people , when they have good ideas , they share for us .
This is a lot of <unk> <unk> , which means that people get less less .
But we 've got a lot more to share .
If we 're talking about the ideas , usually you think about technology .
But there 's also another point of thinking about how we interact with each other , as we communicate , to have a marketplace to support a <unk> college college to save a kind of knowledge for free .
So let 's have a system that allows us to <unk> the land of the government , and people can do it .
If we insist on the laws of the rules , we 're not going to be able to do that for the law that we do n't have to get rid of it , so we can change the fact that the world is better , like <unk> and his friends , and so on . Thank you .
<unk>
From the <unk> of the world , genomics <unk> , for us , tells us about the journey of <unk> diversity . At far , they 've found that millions of genes .
DNA , biosphere , biotech , entrepreneur , genetics , invention , oceans , science , technology
Six
<unk> <unk> : DNA and the oceans
So the rest of the people came to me and asked me how to do it .
My only vision is that .
I think that optimism is much more than <unk> .
And in this 18 minutes , I 'm going to tell you about how we 've done it from the first week of the past , which is called <unk> <unk> .
This is just about 10 years ago , and we published the gene that came from the <unk> of liberal activities , which is the sequence of the flu .
So we 're going to work on the production of the genome to 20 months of <unk> .
Now , the same genome project requires two to eight hours .
So the last 10 years , we 've completed a lot of genome , and most of the species of human species are <unk> many species and species of species and mammals .
After about 10 years of view , we might be able to do this three - to - a - half to five .
We 've just launched a program -- <unk> Moore Foundation received a project as an environmental engineering project , and we 're going to completed this year .
And the rate of <unk> <unk> is change .
But we see that the path of the future is still a long way to explore the surface of this planet .
Most people do n't realize that these <unk> microbial microbes are about half of them , and all of the animals add <unk> to the Earth .
You go to the Atlantic Ocean , and you 're not doing anything , you do n't always do anything about the Oxford , but remember , it 's about a million tons of bacteria in the ocean , but it 's almost a million tons of bacteria in the ocean , but it 's still about tens of thousands of tons of bacteria .
Two years ago , there were only six years of <unk> <unk> , and we decided to do something .
We launched two weeks of <unk> and other big oceans , and we tried to do it every 200 miles each .
<unk> , we 've done it in Bermuda , and we 're going to go into the <unk> and go to the end of the coast , go through the East coast and travel across the Pacific Ocean , and we 're approaching the process of crossing the Pacific Ocean , and here we are trying to cross the coast .
It 's hard to work , and we 're going to take a little bit of interest in a <unk> of scientific interest .
And experimentation is very simple .
And to collect seawater , to filter different sorts of creatures , collect different sizes of biodiversity , and then bring them back to the <unk> labs , where we can call the DNA of every 24 hours per day .
We 've got some amazing discovery .
So for example , we think about the <unk> of the natural world , there 's only one only two of these organisms that have <unk> with us .
But then it turns out that there 's almost almost every species of light that has this receptor in the warm ocean , and it 's used to use sunlight and use the sun as an energy channel and communication .
It 's just a collection of things that we can find from the gecko , and we 'll find 130 million genes for five million <unk> .
This is funded from <unk> Foundation , and we 're going to expand research into air .
We 're looking at how many times the air and bacteria we breathe every day are particularly <unk> , especially in the airplane and the <unk> .
We do this with a few simple instruments in the streets of New York City , and we 're going to collect billions of years of microorganisms .
Now we 're doing that right now .
It 's just from data in the streams of data , and we 've found that almost 200 miles per gallon we can see from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> may explain this diversity .
This is a picture based on the heat of temperature , and the red line is the blue area of the cold , where we found that , in the warm ocean , we found that there 's a lot of diversity in the frozen ocean , and the amount of differences between the <unk> of the species are extremely different from the population of species , at the same time , on the planet , in which there are huge differences in it , there is a huge difference in that region , which is very much different .
And the other thing that 's surprising to us is that these light particles can detect light bulbs , and we can make sure that this process is based on their metabolic sequence .
In different areas , they 're very different .
Maybe it 's not surprising to be <unk> at almost a deep sea in the deep ocean , " looking at the blue line . "
And when there 's a large amount of <unk> , they look at a lot of <unk> .
The difference between <unk> and <unk> is probably different than <unk> .
So for all of the genes we 've done , we <unk> all kinds of data , and we have all the data that we 're going to see in the developing world , which is about half the data on Earth .
And we put these genes into the gene , trying to answer that , we found that the new members of gene family also found new genes ?
And it turns out that we found that there were about five million ancient family family , but we 've got every new skeleton of the system , and we have all the new ones of these new families .
So we 're looking at the earliest phase of life and genetics and genes .
So let 's look at the evolution of evolution , and we 're in the upper corner , and we 're on the right .
In the animal kingdom , there 's about 10,000 genes in our animal , and our genome is only accelerating genes .
If you have all sorts of animals , we 're not able to share a quarter - year - old amount of genes in <unk> or more .
Now , I 'm not going to show you the design of the gene .
And we 're going to go from " gene account " -- maybe to the Richard <unk> theory -- rather than " The Laws of <unk> " to think about them .
<unk> DNA , it 's the ability to use DNA for the last decade or two , and in some way , the <unk> of DNA has been evolving in a way .
The idea of <unk> genome is in 1995 , when we think about the second genome , the <unk> .
And we made a very good shirt , and I said , " I ca n't believe my <unk> . "
This is actually a little creature .
And there 's about 500 genes .
<unk> <unk> has <unk> genes .
We asked the question , if a species needs 800 genes , another one needs 500 , a smaller gene in a small gene .
So we started doing <unk> <unk> .
There 's a short clip of DNA <unk> called <unk> <unk> .
If you look at the gene , you <unk> the genes .
So we found that all of the genes that could be able to accept the gene and make the " map " map .
But what we found is that the effects of the environment are very crucial , and we 're only able to define the conditions that need to have the conditions that need to be necessary and need to make genes necessary .
We also try to do a much more intuitive study of <unk> relationships , and we 're trying to compare their genome , to see whether they have common <unk> .
So we 've got these <unk> circles , and we found that only <unk> genes are the same .
And if you ignore an organ in a cell organ , it can expand a little bit more , when we look at the core , when we look at the nub of the core gene .
So we think we can expand from the minimum 500 or shrinking -- how do you see this problem -- about 300 to 400 genes to 400 genes .
The only way to prove that this theory is to build a chromosomes with these genes , and we have to use it based on the way we express the lens .
And we found that large - specific <unk> DNA is very , very , very difficult .
My colleague , <unk> Smith and <unk> <unk> invented a new new way of creating a very exciting new approach to a virus in two weeks .
So that 's a very exciting experiment : we 're just going to have a <unk> of DNA , and we 've just <unk> the DNA of the bacteria -- and suddenly DNA starts to remix germs .
This is not the first time that 's been created a year ago , a little bit of a <unk> virus formed , but it 's only the only virus that has been created by one , three years ago , for three years .
This is one of the <unk> structures of <unk> <unk> .
This is a software for the software to create new ideas for our biology .
Somebody immediately began to worry about the threat of the dangers of <unk> , and I was in the <unk> <unk> and the other <unk> of the United States in the United States .
And I think the most important thing is that it 's not what happens to the truth .
Basically , any of the genome is already <unk> by <unk> .
And so people are struck by <unk> <unk> or smallpox , so they 're not afraid of DNA , but from that organism .
So even if some of you have made the DNA of smallpox , it does n't divide in infections .
What <unk> really needs is the <unk> virus .
And only two countries , the U.S. and the Soviet Union , had to do it for the first time in order to do it .
And if these studies have been really <unk> , then in the future , the <unk> of the people in the future .
I think that two years of manufacturing is possible .
And the <unk> we have in our own lives may be created for decades .
We can discriminate from the different mediums of <unk> and different figures that allow us to build different structures .
And the point is , how do you put all the other things together ?
And we 're starting to start with these images and <unk> the system to the chromosomes .
This is from a creature called <unk> radiation to sustain energy in three million pounds of radiation .
In <unk> , 12 to 24 hours of the chromosomes , it can also <unk> its chromosomes .
This creature is almost everywhere on Earth , even though the activities of human activity might still be in space .
This is <unk> <unk> in about 500,000 radiation .
It 's starting to melt , and it 's a little bit more pleasurable to melt in the bottom .
This is actually a chromosome in 170 <unk> radiation .
It 's almost almost entirely <unk> .
Next is the same thing that 's 24 hours after the same DNA <unk> .
This is really amazing , and if you do n't find tens of thousands of species , maybe we can also find thousands of species .
These are the first ones that allow them to stack them into another type of cells .
So we think that synthetic cells are going to have a huge amount of power , not only in biology , but it 's possible to help us cope with environmental and social problems .
For example , from a third of the first bio - <unk> <unk> of <unk> methane , life has been <unk> in the equivalent of water , as an energy source of energy , to monitor the carbon dioxide for the environment .
<unk> , through many different ways , thousands of organisms are able to capture and depend on CO2 .
So we can build carbon from the atmosphere , to create carbon - <unk> , or other products to replace carbon .
We depend on biology , and we use it to <unk> water <unk> , building water and oxygen and oxygen .
And also , there 's a lot of ways to translate into methane .
<unk> and Norway have a quarter - year - old ratio that goes into the harbor and convert it into a positive product .
And suddenly , I think , you have a new field , " <unk> <unk> " -- because there 's all these new kinds of <unk> that have so big genetic sequences that are so large that we can design a robot that can be able to create a long - scale chromosomes .
So all of the biology is able to choose whether it 's going to work in the screen , or whether it 's in the screen , or it 's just a war , or a war .
The functions of understanding these genes will be <unk> .
We 're trying to change the <unk> , and we 're trying to make <unk> under the sun .
<unk> <unk> , and we use the <unk> of oxygen with oxygen attached to oxygen .
We also add multiple amounts of <unk> , and these enzymes can make complex grass in the same cell .
In some big labs , it started using microbes production .
<unk> chemical chemicals in the environment are more complex than our best chemists .
Maybe the <unk> of the future will become the source of our food source , the environmental energy source , and even <unk> the <unk> industry .
So let me end with the end of the study of moral and policy .
We <unk> the experiments of 1999 , until we should try to figure out how to create artificial species , and then it 's going to continue to talk about it .
All of the major religions are involved .
It 's a strange study , because a lot of religious leaders are in their membership , as a law , and ca n't figure out how to stop life , so that it 's not really the most important thing to do , but it does n't matter what 's going on in the way that we 've done this .
Now the foundation of the Foundation has been funded by a lot of <unk> research , which is that the risk of these experiments is to make the risks and the benefits for the social community , and in this area , we 're trying to figure out what 's going on in the field , but we also try to become a good model .
There is a lot of complex problems .
In addition to <unk> , they 're really very simple : we 're designed to design the production of clean energy cells through various simple steps in different ways .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> says that most of us hate happiness and success : that 's what we 're going to do with the past , and to think about the quality of the future , he suggests that we have to adjust the idea of time .
brain , business , happiness , mind , psychology , science
<unk>
<unk> is on the idea of health .
And I want to share with you some of the mythic power of time , of course , in very short time .
Video : Okay , first , 30 seconds per second .
Keep the silence .
Notice time . End of <unk> .
Takes about 15 seconds per hour .
Ten , nine , eight , six , five , four , three , two .
<unk> <unk> : Let 's see this dialogue about Adam
So fast , Adam , do n't get <unk> ; I 've got <unk> .
Oh , Adam . No , do n't give you <unk> .
I do n't know .
I do n't want to dwell on the boat .
Okay , so , you know , what ?
It 's a lot of <unk> , and it 's everywhere : <unk> or <unk> is , not , right now , <unk> and <unk> .
And when you start , morality will be broken .
And those <unk> women are n't having sex -- that little <unk> of a high bank of mine , roughly 60 percent of the people in the last year .
And these guys are almost dead .
A lot of commitment .
Now we 're going to try and get four kids , four years old , to do a trial .
They now have a <unk> candy , and if they can wait , you can get two <unk> <unk> .
This is , of course , need to deliver , if you really love the marshmallow , that 's waiting .
But the result is three - thirds of the kids <unk> .
They ca n't wait . Of course , other kids have second <unk> .
Because they are oppressed by the eradication of failures .
<unk> , I was in my colleagues in Brooklyn , and he went to the <unk> of 14 years later and found these kids , and they were in the case of the situation where they are today .
And it turns out that these two groups have a huge difference in the population .
And those days long , the kids who are waiting for the next two days , and they 're trying to get a thousand times a year .
How big is that big difference . This is a different amount of kids .
They do n't have any problem . They 're good students .
They self - confident and <unk> , and what I 'm talking about is the same thing as the key to the point , which is that you 're based on " <unk> " to " present " for the future .
So what is time for ? This is what I 'm going to talk about .
It 's a time - lapse view of research , and how we are in the age of time , how to minimize the experience or in time .
And we 've always been doing it .
There 's a lot of value in the way that we make things , including different kinds of <unk> , countries , interdependence and different educational background .
And the problem is that because of these things , ultimately , the timing of time is <unk> , because you learn all sorts of people used to use it .
What caused you ?
What you 're doing is based on what you do .
For some people , this decided to be based based on other people 's instincts .
We 're making decisions based on what we call : " <unk> , " because they 're focused on it .
In other people , what 's happening is nothing important .
It 's like , " I 've seen something like this before . "
So they 're making decisions .
We call these people : " <unk> , " because they 're focused on the past .
There are also some people who are not based on now , not the past , but the future .
They focused on the consequences .
It 's like cost - effective analysis .
We 're called these people : the future , because they 're focused on the future .
So , a time period , what I 'm going to talk about is that time - lapse <unk> will not have a factor for every factor of every decision you make , and you 're completely unaware of it ?
So you have a certain amount of experience .
In fact , there 's a six - time projection , two of them are called " <unk> now . "
Two is in " <unk> , " and two are <unk> .
You can focus on " positive " or " negative . "
It can also focus on what you 're looking at in life , whether you live in your lives , or whether it 's <unk> , because your life is <unk> .
And of course , you can also create a goal .
Or for the future , the life is dead after dead .
And through <unk> flexibility , it takes a long time to do this , and this is what you need to learn to do .
So , what is the best time for doing this ?
The altitude depends on " positive experiences , " which depends on the future .
<unk> depends on " <unk> . "
It never occurred to the " negative experience . "
In fact , the best time to think about it is based on your experience , " positive experience . "
From the future , it 's worth <unk> .
What you 're looking at is motivation , which is driven by the world , and other people and the other .
Every time you do it , it 's always <unk> than <unk> .
For example : what do we need to pay for a success success ?
We need to spend a lot of time with family - to - family relationships .
<unk> the timing of happiness , needing sacrifice people .
It needs a lot of <unk> , and it needs to sacrifice sleep , so it will affect health .
There 's only a job in their lives , and they work in work .
And I bet some of you have been working on this .
These are people who have <unk> , and I was born in the city of the South Bronx , who was a poor man who had been born with the <unk> of <unk> . Everyone was on the verge of <unk> and living .
And in here , I , as a person , is open up to my teachers , and I 've made all the sacrifice and <unk> me to change the future .
Tell me not that the weak caffeine is , because if you wait , you can eat two , until I learned how to balance it .
Now I learned " <unk> now , " and also also learning the <unk> experience , and I feel like I 've never had the opportunity to be happy since I ever had ever been happy .
Here , I just want to say , you know , the problem is to create a lot of problems in the world to change the <unk> of schools , <unk> drugs , stimulate the laws of the teenagers who have Parkinson 's Law -- <unk> <unk> , who is creating a <unk> that has the same amount of resistance to a hospital , and it 's going to make a difference between the people who are being <unk> and protect the population of <unk> .
And the last thing I want to say is that there 's a lot of responses to experience and other people who understand themselves and other people .
The truth is , it 's a simple and understandable point .
Thank you .

How many of the headlines today are making 10 years today , 1,000 years ? Half a long term of news , " Long News " project , collecting them not only in the next few years , and even a few hundred years of what the headline is to shape the future .
future , global issues , media , news , science
<unk>
<unk> : Now , real news .
We 're thrown out of news .
That 's 350 million volumes a year published .
This is only a <unk> plate .
My problem is , how many of these are the news effects .
This is what 's called a long - term news .
This is a project funded by <unk> Foundation Foundation , which is founded by TED Foundation and <unk> <unk> .
We 're trying to figure out what 's going on , 50 percent of the news stories are 50 or 100 years later .
And I mean , there 's a lot of news that 's going to fall out of the way .
Suppose you 've been looking at the headlines in the last 10 years , where are you going to make a difference ?
Or do you ?
Or do you ?
Is it true ?
Are there a difference between 50 or 100 years ?
Okay , so that 's cool .
But the headlines in the last year are economic and I will never finish the end , and this particular economy is going to become a <unk> .
So what might the story of the future effect ?
Okay , let 's start with science .
One day , a mini robot can get rid of our blood pressure .
And if you 're a mouse , it 's been released .
A few of the latest articles , <unk> <unk> , killed the tumor , and they <unk> the gene inside the brain , which they built in the human body .
Autonomy : How do we negotiate with 90 billion people ?
We do n't have a hundred billion people at the time .
We heard that yesterday , over 10 people hungry .
There is no genetically engineered crop .
Luckily , Bill Gates delivers 10 billion dollars for <unk> research .
So what about international political political ?
And the world is very different , and if you make it happen , they might have done it .
They have over the United States become the largest car market market in the world , and they 're more likely to get to the end of the German , they 've already started doing DNA tests for their kids .
We 're looking for all sorts of ways that we know all sorts of limitations .
There 's a few recent people who have found out in Argentina now , and now spread around each continents , where there is a self - <unk> robot that has a ego , a very rapid , scientific scientist who is not going to need us to do that , but we 've no longer need to have a microbial system .
It does n't matter whether we live .
But the long time I picked up last year , I chose , " This one , the moon .
This makes a lot of money on the moon .
If NASA does n't do that , maybe China or some people are doing a very big check in China .
And what I want to do is to show you a long story , some of the news stories are more important than others .

This is a planet <unk> <unk> , and we showed the image of the <unk> satellite , the probe of Saturn 's largest satellite on Saturn .

Yves <unk> on Mars
In the next 18 minutes , I 'll take you .
I did n't stop trying to stop the journey , 50 years ago , human <unk> took the Earth .
And in this 50 years , it 's not only about the moon , but all eight of them send robots , our distances are <unk> , and we 've got a <unk> <unk> that has a license , which is <unk> the planet and the last time we 're <unk> .
All of these robots are actually part of the human race : A <unk> for understanding , to understand how we sit in the universe , understand the origin of understanding human origins , understanding the Earth and the development of humans .
In the midst of the solar system , we 're looking at the answer , and we 've found answers , humans have gone up to Saturn -- early in the early 80s -- and humans are exploring the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which is the most <unk> probe that goes into the orbit of this system .
Now , Saturn is a <unk> planet .
And her <unk> , she gives her science and she 's glamorous and <unk> the new findings of the universe .
And so she studied this , and we learned that a lot of these stars are called <unk> galaxies called neutrinos .
This is a fabulous picture of Andromeda , Andromeda galaxy , <unk> galaxies , and also the largest spiral - <unk> galaxy .
This is one of the most beautiful images of <unk> Space Telescope .
So in the journey of Saturn 's journey , it 's actually -- for example , the <unk> of human beings to understand the flexibility associated with the interconnectedness of the locals and the human behavior .
It 's not going to show you all the information for all of you .
I could n't show you the beautiful picture of the last two or two years .
But I 'm going to look at two of the most exciting aspects of Saturn in the last two years .
This is the <unk> of a group of large and diverse satellites .
And they have only <unk> , and there are the American <unk> from <unk> .
In fact , the most beautiful photo is that the <unk> of the satellite is Saturn , and this is an explosion of Saturn and <unk> , which is a <unk> Earth -- and it 's actually expanding the surface of a planet .
These are two <unk> of <unk> satellites .
<unk> up to the largest moon , Saturn 's largest satellite , until it comes into the orbit , and it 's very exploration .
And for people who study planets , it 's a very glamorous body .
It has a big , <unk> atmosphere , which is very close to the Earth , and at least the atmosphere of the planet , it 's like , in the past , it is like this .
And it 's the atmosphere of this molecule , as we do this room , but its atmosphere is full of methane , <unk> and <unk> .
And so these molecules are extremely high and very high .
And these <unk> are ubiquitous .
It does n't look at the surface of our eye .
But the existence of these <unk> has been <unk> over tens of thousands of years from the surface of the Earth , and it <unk> to form organic <unk> .
And so I do n't know what the Earth looks like .
This is what we 're sure . These molecules are particularly methane and <unk> , and it 's a liquid .
We found that methane is the water of Saturn .
And in the atmosphere , there 's this discovery that 's possible for a lot of <unk> , and it 's going to be able to cover the <unk> <unk> of methane , which has a high - speed <unk> ceiling .
It 's 350 pounds across the ground .
<unk> , but also the <unk> .
It 's like Earth , Saturn , the <unk> river and the big waterfall and <unk> , <unk> and currents .
That 's the end of the <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> to the <unk> . And you stop thinking .
What would the surface of Saturn look like ?
<unk> on Saturn is dark , like <unk> Earth .
That 's the cold , and it 's <unk> , it might be <unk> in front of the rain , imagining in front of the rain .
In <unk> , we 've found that we 're finding a lot of different things about Saturn , but it 's equally different .
For the people who are passionate about love , this is like an <unk> novel .
As I said , Saturn has a <unk> atmosphere .
This is a picture of a painting that Bob <unk> on the sun .
This is another moon , and I do n't know what one of the stars .
And the equipment that goes through the atmosphere can be able to look at the surface of the atmosphere , looking at the surface of the atmosphere .
This is our photo .
There are light and dark areas that we 've got to achieve this level .
And this is very mysterious -- how do we do it in the orbit of Saturn .
When you look at you , you 've got to discover something like <unk> , which is what we do n't know .
And then we 're a <unk> , but we do n't have a few months left , so that 's a new surface .
It 's also <unk> .
Some of it seems to be <unk> .
And in any planet , you see <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> here are change .
But we ca n't understand this image until six months later , a discovery that goes into orbit to Saturn , which can be called <unk> Saturn .
This is the winner of the <unk> probe , and the European <unk> of Europe , which is seven years old . We 're going to go into the atmosphere and get out of those two hours of land , eventually land and landing .
And I think that 's important .
This is the instrument of <unk> , the first time in the history of human history .
This is important for me to celebrate <unk> , and we 're not going to do it in <unk> .
.
So there 's a lot of reasons , which is , this is a international task in Europe , and Germany , people <unk> speaking speaking in Britain , in the U.K. , French , France , Italy .
This is a true definition of what you 're looking for for the United Nations , who is participating in the future , participating in the future .
So , exploring a planet is a big undertaking , and it 's been exploring the planet of a human history .
These are the ones that I 've lost .
And this is a few exciting moments , and I 'm going to stop forever .
.
But the <unk> came out of the process of <unk> photos .
And so the first photo takes off the surface , and that 's what it 's about to do .
It 's amazing that this is a picture that we 've engineered .
This is a clear , <unk> image .
And that <unk> face is just forming its toes .
You can see how they draw on the top of the channel .
It will rain in the middle .
What you see here is the Grand Canyon .
Is it liquid ? We do n't know .
But this is some kind of <unk> .
This photo was taken in the 16 square meter .
This is eight kilometers wide . Okay , wait .
Okay , 16 kilometers , eight kilometers --
This is about the airplane in the U.S.
This is the view of the wing .
And finally , it 's <unk> - up ladies and <unk> , and I 'm going to show you a picture of <unk> solar system .
This is the Ross Sea .
These are little ice ice .
.
And obviously , the probe goes up to the opposite , and the darkness , no cuts , so it does n't fall out .
This is actually <unk> .
This <unk> area is full of liquid methane .
And this is about why these sorts of things migrate down on the bottom of the <unk> , where we 're seeing the slope that we 've seen .
That 's where <unk> goes .
But the photo of our photo is not a little bit of a <unk> of water .
What is the water ? When we found the sand ceiling , it becomes more <unk> .
This is the ice that we take on the equator , and these videos are about 100 million times a little bit higher .
This is 1,000 to 16,000 kilometers long .
It 's <unk> to land .
And obviously , if you do n't have a boat , you do n't have a <unk> .
So , <unk> is <unk> , and we do n't have water , but we found it in <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
It 's about 30,000 .
It 's about 10 years to fly to the Arctic , and then you find the size of the <unk> .
And what we 're interested in is that the liquid is going to land in some seasons .
You also think that it 's amazing , mysterious . It 's full of non - <unk> , but there 's a planet that has the same Earth and the Earth 's equivalent of the planet , and that 's the beautiful planet in the world , the only planet around the system that can be used in complexity and <unk> .
If you look at <unk> , <unk> is a very small planet , only 10 big , and this is what it is , it 's not the size of the Earth .
.
<unk> are white , and it 's full of light .
<unk> <unk> active activity
But the <unk> on the Antarctica -- this is the Antarctic , and we found <unk> .
This color color is different because the difference is different .
And these <unk> <unk> this organic material .
And at the same time , the whole region goes down . It 's the highest amount of temperature .
This is a very <unk> , like a <unk> Earth , which is much more than the equator .
And if you look at the other end of the ice , you 've got the <unk> equivalent of the ice .
And over the course of the <unk> , we can see the ice ice cream , and we 're seeing that ice is formed in other images , it 's about <unk> miles per second .
My team and my team analyzed the image , like this , other <unk> photos .
And what we found was that these <unk> might be the defender of a young year - old chamber .
It might be liquid , organic or <unk> .
This is an unexpected discovery of the <unk> of modern galaxies , another living environment that can survive .
You do n't have to say , all of you know that there are other planets in the solar system whether it 's <unk> or something else , and there 's a lot of variation in life .
And if we could prove that there was nothing to do , it was twice the other year , in other planets , through the solar system , over the course of the Earth .
Now , Earth is the only planet we know about Earth .
That 's precious and unique , but also the only family we have .
For people in the late 60s , the <unk> of the century is not even the case , when you remember it , eight - year - old <unk> -- the photos in November .
That 's the Earth 's picture of <unk> from space , and the values of the planet , the responsibility for our planet and our homeland .
You can say that the first one does n't make the picture of the human eye .
This is the ice that looks at the other side of Saturn .
And in this picture of this painting , these paintings that are shaped by the sun , and this is the tilt of the Sun , which is <unk> , that 's a shot of <unk> .
And if these were n't beautiful enough , look at this image of the Earth 's picture of Saturn .
From far from far , our homes are moving out of the space space , and we 've taken the planet .
Maybe it 's a long - term projection for our reward for us .
Thank you very much .

By 2005 , there are only 15 percent of the areas that are in the world , and this makes the price of <unk> , but the terrain and the roads are also allowing the economy to not make a difference . In this short talk , Google <unk> shows the software that people use to <unk> the map .
collaboration , design , map , technology

Yves <unk> : Building the map , <unk> , economics
In 2008 , <unk> attacked the <unk> .
<unk> people get help .
The United Nations wants to think about a community , steady , steady .
But it does n't have the map of the <unk> Empire , and it 's not a <unk> hospital , so it ca n't help the population .
When we look at Los Angeles , the map of the London London map is the same thing that comes in the world in 2005 , and there 's about 15 percent of <unk> software , which is <unk> .
This is the same question that most people have faced with the world : Nobody has a map .
Luckily .
And in Google , there 's 40 volunteers of a software tag on the road , 300 miles per gallon , transportation and relief centers .
They had four days .
How do they use software ? It 's Google <unk> .
Google <unk> is a technology that allows us to refer to our place .
And people use this kind of stuff on the map , and the rivers of the river , the <unk> , the location of the ice , the local company , goes to the corner corner .
<unk> is important .
And the Nobel Prize has been rejected by the people who refer to a lot of the <unk> of development in the developing world of developing countries .
For example , as long as it 's in India , it does n't have been developed .
And as you 've seen over the last year , there are millions of people who are able to make millions of pounds from the maps that have never been seen before .
And this is all about the users of the world that make this happen .
So let 's look at this map of these users .
That 's where we 're here , and there are 170 countries on the board .
You can see that there 's a road in the <unk> of Africa .
A little bit over the end of the tag in the <unk> Bangalore .
This is the result of the computer mechanical movement , the results of the machine .
This is the distribution of distribution over hundreds of cities , thousands of users , one person , a message , a message .
This is also a segment for 70 percent of the world 's population .
Welcome to <unk> .

In 2003 , in the midst of an <unk> village , <unk> , people who have been working on the <unk> of the Israeli military personnel , they 've heard about 10 months of non - violent <unk> . Can you hear about it ? And is n't it possible that the Brazilian film <unk> <unk> asks : Why do n't we pay attention to the leopard leaders ?
arts , communication , compassion , entertainment , film , peace , violence , war

<unk> <unk> : Understanding non - violent
I 'm a <unk> <unk> .
In the last eight years , I had my face on the <unk> of Israel and Palestinian methods .
Whenever I went to work in the United States , in Europe , I would always meet a problem with a Palestinian coup in Europe .
Why are they <unk> non - violent <unk> ?
And every time I heard this problem , because I 've always come back from the Middle East , my job is to get rid of the <unk> of <unk> , and they 're starving from NGOs and <unk> .
These leaders are trying to figure out a huge amount of non - violent <unk> in this area , and it 's building peace .
But most people could never hear them .
And the problem with <unk> is that one of the key reasons between the world is why Palestinian peace is n't successful .
What I 'm going to talk about today is the power of attention , your ability to focus on the rise of <unk> and <unk> areas and other areas of non - violent movement , where I are trying to analyze the character of the <unk> .
And I think that the most <unk> of non - conflict movement is not that they start to start fighting violent activities , but let 's start focused on the people who have already begun to see violent movement .
And then I brought you to this village to explain this to the village , which is <unk> <unk> .
It 's about seven or seven years ago , and it 's been announced that this is going to be released in this village , which throws it up to the village .
<unk> will lose 40 percent of the land that 's going to be lost from the <unk> in the <unk> area .
In the local leaders of the community , they launched a peace <unk> to do this .
And I 'm going to show you some of the dots that you know about diving on the field .
Palestinian women : they say that it 's going to kill the Palestinian and Israel <unk> .
And in the <unk> , we realized that the opposite will fall in our land .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is actually a solution to fight terrorists .
I 'm asking you to join a peace <unk> .
<unk> with you is <unk> Israeli - <unk> .
Israel : <unk> military personnel are afraid of non - violence .
Woman : We see men trying to get rid of those soldiers , but nobody is successful .
And I think that girls can do it .
<unk> : We have to have the minds of the brain .
Tim organizing : We 're completely peace , we want to make it happen .
<unk> : Everyone from the band
Yves Behar on <unk>
<unk> : <unk> conflict , still persists .
<unk> : The Israeli minister <unk> <unk> .
They 're allowed to use all of the necessary skills of everything .
Guy : They 're catching up .
Here are the <unk> everywhere .
<unk> : I know we 're going to be <unk> .
Most of us do n't have a bad fear .
Israeli fighters : One non - <unk> ca n't stop us .
<unk> : This is a peace <unk> .
We do n't need electric power .
<unk> : We 're killing us .
We do n't believe it .
<unk> <unk> : When I first heard about this story , I feel very surprised that the global media has never been written in 2003 .
And the more amazing thing is that <unk> ended up <unk> .
And over the course of 10 months of peace , there 's a group of people who are convinced that they 're going to be <unk> from their land , and it 's the International Committee of <unk> , which is the International <unk> of the West , where they 're going to depend on the <unk> in the world , right ?
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is in all the mountains of <unk> and Jerusalem .
But media is almost almost entirely the same .
This noise is growing even further from the Palestinian / AIDS / <unk> <unk> .
There is a very important aspect of violence and non - violent violence , like a theater , to attract audiences love .
If violence is always going to take the attention of the world , it 's very difficult to demonstrate about the <unk> of peace , and that 's the way that religion is <unk> to the <unk> of the world .
This is not familiar with the power of the people in the neighborhood .
If you have a parent , you 've got the parents ' attention , and then your kids have to be better .
<unk> , as a result , is the function of the child , and it 's a function of kids who are teaching her attention to this way .
The parents can inspire or <unk> and <unk> that behavior .
And this is also about adults .
In fact , the behavior of community and state - to - vary behavior is to change the aspects of the international community .
I believe that the authority of the Middle East provides the key to the <unk> of peace , which is that we 're going to move through a lot of resistance to a <unk> <unk> , a functional <unk> .
And in the area of <unk> and <unk> , I saw the impact on the <unk> of the ice , and I witnessed the effects of a documentary change in the area of behavior .
There was a <unk> in the temple in Jerusalem , the <unk> of <unk> , which was <unk> <unk> .
They 're going to have to lose huge amounts of land , and they 're not going to go into the <unk> or the Jerusalem .
After two years of violence , they eventually end up calling because they did n't have any attention .
So we 've got a documentary there .
They had a week later , and they managed to produce the most glamorous <unk> in the world .
And <unk> said that when <unk> saw the story of the documentary , they felt that somebody was concerned with people .
So they did n't give up .
Israel has a new degree of peace , called " <unk> <unk> , " in <unk> .
The <unk> story became one of the major skills of this movement .
And they look at the <unk> of the Israeli , and the people who have never been able to see the power of non - <unk> and start to get them to action .
<unk> <unk> , for example , tells us that even independent independent movies can also help prevent non - violent situations , to make a difference .
Imagine the dominant media , if it started to report a week in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and Jerusalem of Jerusalem , and how much of it is going to happen .
And I think the most important thing is that we have to recognize that if we do n't pay attention to these movement , they 're invisible .
But I have a lot of experience for the experience , if we look at the movement .
And once they come up with the influence , they 're going to be in conflict .
This impacts will end up with conflict .
And these leaders proved the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
We look at them , and we 're looking for them to prove that this is possible .
Thank you .

Simon <unk> : How great leaders inspired action
How did it happen when the development of things happened ?
In other words , when others seem modern , how do you explain ?
For example , why is Apple so powerful ?
For years , years later , they 're more creative than all of the players .
And they 're just a <unk> .
They did n't have any other company .
The same way , with the same person , <unk> , mentors , and media .
So why do they seem to have a special thing ?
Similarly , why is it from Martin Luther King ?
And that time at the time , in the United States , it was n't only about one person , and he did n't have the only great <unk> of the time .
Why ?
Why why <unk> can make an electric control plane , and the other teams are more capable , much more powerful , more money .
They made a <unk> plane , and they managed to build them .
There 's something else that has to do .
About three and a half years ago , I had a new discovery .
This discovery has changed the way that I worked in the world , and even fundamentally changing my work .
And that 's what I found .
I found that all the great leaders of the world and organizations , whether it 's Apple , Martin Luther King , who thinks , they think , acting , interact with action .
But with all the other people 's minds .
And what I did was it was just the easiest idea of the world .
I call it <unk> <unk> .
Why ? How ? What ?
This little model explains why some organizations and leaders can <unk> the secrets and the potential in other people .
I 'll explain it quickly quickly .
Everyone on Earth , every organization understands what they do , 100 percent .
Some of you know how to do it , and you can call it your difference , or your unique set , your whole series of <unk> or whatever you say .
But it 's very , very rare people to understand why .
The reason for that is that " <unk> " is not relevant for profit .
<unk> is just a consequence , and it 's never going to be a consequence .
And I said , " Why are your purpose ?
What do you do ? What kind of faith ?
Why are you there ?
How do you get in the morning every morning ?
Why is other people care ?
And it turns out that the way we think , what we do , is that communication is based on <unk> .
And obviously , what we 're going to do is start a clear way of beginning , and then to <unk> things .
But <unk> leaders and organizations , regardless of the size of their scale , they think , action and communication are <unk> .
Take example .
And I 'm going to show you why it 's a simple <unk> and everyone can understand it .
And if the apple else with other companies , they would say , " We do the best computers .
Design is the design of play , using simplicity , interface .
Do you want to buy one ? " OK .
And that 's the way we communicate .
And also , most of the ways that most managers do , of course , are the way we interact with each other .
We 're talking about what we 're doing , how we are very different , or how they 're better than others , and then we expect some of the reactions to other people , like <unk> , etc .
This is the <unk> of our <unk> lawyers , and we have the best lawyers and the maximum <unk> , we always have our clients .
This is our <unk> , very narrow , <unk> seat , bought one .
But there 's nothing wrong about these workers .
This is the Apple tool .
We 're doing everything , all of the things that are going to be done in order to tackle and innovation .
We believe it should be in different ways .
The way we challenge is that we 're very good at using our product , using simplicity , and interface .
We just did the best computers in this process .
Do you want to buy one ? "
It 's totally different , right ? You 've got to buy one .
And what I do is I 'm going to turn the information directly down .
And the truth is that people are buying it , and they 're not going to buy your product , people get your faith and the purpose .
They 're not going to buy your product , and people are buying your faith .
And this explains why everyone here is bought from Apple to buy computers .
But we 've got the apple from the Apple <unk> , and the phone , or a digital camera , feels very comfortable .
And indeed , I 've already told you , Apple is a <unk> .
There 's no way to show it from the <unk> of the equation .
<unk> and Apple have the same capacity to create all these products .
In fact , they tried .
A few years ago , the <unk> company <unk> <unk> .
They made a strong <unk> .
Because they 've done it for years .
But they did n't have their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , and the quality of their product is very good , the design of the product , but they do n't have these products .
In fact , we ca n't imagine that we can buy a kiss from <unk> .
Why do you get from a football ticket ?
But we did this every day .
They 're not going to get the product you do , and people get your faith .
The goal of the company is not about all of you who need your product .
It 's people who have the same idea with you .
This is the most glamorous part . These are not my own opinions .
These ideas can be found from the roots of biology .
It 's not psychology , it 's biology .
When you look at the brain of your brain , you find the human brain actually divided three major components , and those three parts are really good .
Our latest brain brains , the brain brain , or our cortex , is " What " <unk> . "
We all think about the <unk> of the neocortex and the logic of our <unk> .
Two part in the middle is our two <unk> . <unk> responsibility for our emotions , like trust and loyalty .
<unk> all of the behavior and decisions , but there is no verbal functionality .
In other words , when we communicate with <unk> , people can understand a lot of complex information , like characteristics , things , facts and things .
But this is <unk> action .
When we communicate with <unk> , we 're in the same brain , the brain dialogue , and then we think about what people say and what we do .
That 's the source of what 's going on .
You know , sometimes you show people all kinds of data , and they say , " I know that data and graphs are n't . "
Why do we use this verb , " Ha ha ? "
Because part of the control of control is not <unk> language .
And we said , " I do n't know why , it 's not true . "
Or sometimes you say to the heart of the soul , or a soul .
I do n't want to make it very glamorous , but it 's not the part of the soul .
All of this is happening in your <unk> , controlling decision behavior rather than language .
If you do n't know what you 're doing , someone else will respond to your motivation , and how can you win enough for your support , or even more importantly , to be able to get to the molecule that you are doing .
Once again , the goal is not just to give you something that you have to do , but it 's going to sell things to you .
The goal is not just raising the people who need a job ; the purpose of purpose is to hire people who are devout .
You know , I always say , if you raise somebody 's just because he can do this job , they just work for you , but they 're going to raise you with someone who is devout , and they 'll give you a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
This is a much more appropriate example of the storyline than teachers .
Most people have <unk> <unk> .
In the early 20th century , the passionate devotion of <unk> robots are like the website .
Everyone was doing trying .
<unk> <unk> has all of you thinking about success .
I mean , even though , you ask people , " Why are your product failed or <unk> ? "
And people are always going to answer the same three things that you have to tell you , it 's a lack of money , and you 're not doing it .
And it 's always about three reasons , so let 's take a look at this .
<unk> gave <unk> to five million dollars of money for <unk> robots .
So money is not problem .
And he studied at Harvard , in <unk> , who was very broad . He recognized the most powerful people .
So , he hired the best person to be able to get the most powerful person in the market .
The New York Times came to him , and everyone was supporting him .
But why do you even hear him ?
At the same time , the Ohio temple in <unk> had a couple brothers , Doug Engelbart , who did n't think of what we think success was .
They did n't have money . They use bike shops to do their dreams . There was no group of people who had been in college , and they did not have a college . The New York Times was n't glamorous .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> is a business , a goal .
They believe that if they can develop the robots , will change the growth of the world .
<unk> <unk> is different .
He wanted to be rich , he wanted to <unk> .
And what he 's about is the end result .
It becomes rich .
So look at the bottom .
And the people who were inspired by the teachers that were dreamed of , they were fighting to fight with their <unk> .
The people on the other side are working for the money .
And then the story of <unk> said , every New York Times had to take <unk> parts of it , because that 's where they came back to dinner .
And finally , in August of <unk> , the Wright Academy was successful , but nobody looked at it .
We knew it after a few days .
And then it turned out that <unk> <unk> did n't have pure <unk> , and he did it in the front of the teacher .
And he should say , " Man , this is a great invention , I can improve your technique . " But he does n't .
Because he was n't the first man who did the airplane , and he would n't be rich , so he could n't be famous .
They 're not sharing your product ; it 's your faith .
If you tell your beliefs , you attract people who have the same faith .
But why are people who are very important with those who have the same faith ?
There 's a pattern of innovation , and if you do n't know this pattern , you have to understand this idea .
Our social societies have two billion people .
<unk> people are early <unk> .
The next step is the early <unk> of most , and then most of the <unk> and the final act of the last night .
The only reason for this project is to buy the button , because they 've never seen the telephone .
Even though we 're in a different place in the curve , but the ecology of innovation tells us that if you want to have a lot of money on the public market , you have to wait for 15 percent of the idea that you 're going to get 15 -- and then the market is really open up to the point that it 's really really opened .
And I said to the company , " How do you get a new business ? "
They 're proud to tell you , " Oh , it 's about 10 percent . "
Yeah , you 're probably going to die 10 percent of the time .
We can make these 10 percent .
Yeah , we do this .
It 's like , " Oh , they 're a little bit <unk> . "
And the question is : How do you find those who are n't going to be able to get someone who ca n't get to the people who can not afford ?
And this is the problem , which is this gap , and you have to send the gap to the air , as <unk> said , " From <unk> , it 's not going to try new things , unless some people have already started trying to figure out .
And these people , <unk> and early <unk> , they like grey attempts .
They 're more natural than what they 're doing , but it 's not just the product of the market .
This is a few days from the head of the iPhone , waiting for six hours to buy the person , and as soon as a week you can walk into a car seat .
This is a group of four million people at the airport , and you 've got one person in the first four million years , even though the technology was n't released .
It 's not because they are n't technology , and they 're sharing those products , but for them .
Because they want to be the first person to experience a new experience .
They 're not sharing your product ; people get your faith . Your action is just proof of your beliefs .
In fact , people will go to their beliefs .
And those who came to the iPhone , six hours of <unk> in the head , was based on their worldview , and they wanted to think about how to see themselves . They 're the first experience .
They 're not sharing your product ; they 're buying your faith .
And I 'm going to give you one example of the most famous examples of innovation , which is a success example of a success .
First of all , we 've got this failed example .
It 's still business .
As we did a second two weeks ago , the element of success is <unk> , good people and good markets .
Look at <unk> .
Since <unk> , it 's about eight or nine years ago , until today , they are the only quality product of the market , and it does n't have any <unk> .
They 're absolutely money .
The market is great .
In fact , " <unk> is a verb of everyday <unk> .
For example , I often put things down to me with digital digital videos .
But <unk> is an economic case .
They did n't make it .
And they 're about 30 to 40 dollars a year , and then it 's a straight line , and the price is no longer more than 10 dollars per dollar ?
In fact , what I saw was that it never could have been more than six dollars per year , except in a few months .
Because you 'll notice that the <unk> companies are just telling us what they 're doing .
They say , " Our product can shoot the TV , <unk> the ads , and remember what you 're looking at .
People say , " We do n't believe you either .
We do n't need something like this , we 're not like it .
You 're <unk> . "
If they say , " If you want to control the life of life , friends , then try our product .
It <unk> the show , <unk> ads , and I 've got a show that you 're looking at , and so on .
They 're not sharing your product ; people are buying your faith . You 're doing it .
And I 'm going to tell you a successful example .
<unk> , in summer , 25 million people in Washington , listening to Martin Luther King .
At the time , it was n't <unk> , and it could n't be visited in the Web .
How do you have 25 people involved ?
And , Dr. <unk> is not the only great <unk> ever in America .
It 's not the only person in the United States who did the most <unk> <unk> in the United States .
In fact , some of his thoughts were n't right .
But he had a talent .
And he did n't have the American need to change the U.S.
He 's just telling people what he believes .

And those who are equally equally respected with his same belief , and they 're starting to tell the truth .
Some people build organizations that are going to be more organized to people .
You see , it 's a 25 million people in this day , and that 's when it comes together .
How many people have to listen to " <unk> " and what ?
No one .
They 're doing it for them .
That 's what they 're passionate about for the United States for eight hours of <unk> , standing in the streets of Washington D.C. .
It 's the belief that they believe that it 's not black and white , and 25 percent of the men are white .
And Dr. <unk> believes that there are two types of <unk> in the world , and it 's a combination of progress .
And that , until all sorts of laws of legal and progress , we 're really concerned about the world 's world .
<unk> is just going to help him get to the truth .
And we 're doing it , not for him , but for us .
By the way , his talk is " I have a dream . "
You 've seen 12 <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> .
Nothing happened .
Some people are oppressed and others are leaders .
<unk> is just the position of the power of power and <unk> , but only a leader of leaders can predict us .
Whether they are people , we 're all going to get <unk> leaders , not because we have to do it , but we will .
We 're following people who are leaders , not for them , but for us .
And there are only the people who come from " Why are the circles in " circle " or " <unk> " to be able to regulate their people .
Thank you .
<unk>
How do you get to the place where you 're going to get down ? How can you make a difference ? The <unk> scientist Hans Rosling studies the function of the nervous system , and the relationship with <unk> and <unk> .
brain , cognitive science , exploration , <unk> , science
<unk>
Neil <unk> : How brain brain does
When we 're in big parking clinics , how do you wake up shooting at ?
This is the question of <unk> <unk> .
And then we 're going to try and understand what the <unk> is like , " <unk> <unk> . "
We 're starting to focus on the brain , which is yellow , and this is our memory organ .
If <unk> is injured , like Alzheimer 's disease , you 're going to lose <unk> , or <unk> car seats .
And the <unk> of this <unk> is in Latin Africa , " <unk> <unk> " because the brain is looking like a kind of " <unk> . "
<unk> and brain other areas are similar to the brain .
The brain is based on a billion neurons .
And each neuron is connected through some kind of <unk> , and sending a little bit of power or <unk> , or " communication . "
In <unk> , two - thirds of the population is made of cells , and these two cells connect together .
And what scientists do n't know is that part of the brain cells in a certain context , in an environment , is to understand how space - memory works , and how it works .
Now imagine , we 're looking for a neuron in this mouse , " video <unk> . "
And every time that 's made of smaller <unk> , then you come up with a red dot and a <unk> .
And we can see that every single one of the cells came into a certain place in the environment , and this neuron would have a reaction .
And then this cell , over the course of the little <unk> , will <unk> the other areas in the brain .
And then we can <unk> the amount of dopamine in the same place where the cell phones are in place .
And if we 've made a lot of different types of cells , then you 'll see that when the mouse is covered in different locations , different neurons will produce their monitor , as we see in these squares .
And these signals are <unk> in other areas of the brain , and it 's going to continue to make a map , " What are the components in the environment ? "
We also have the neural cells in the brain .
<unk> people sometimes need to monitor their <unk> activities .
Some people play a video game , games where they 're free to drive in a town .
And then when they 're killing the brain , their brain 's brain cells are activated , and the neuron is activated .
So what 's the origin of the cell cells ?
There are two neuron cells here , and they 're telling us , in the limits of the environment .
The cells on top of it tend to get signals in the middle to the center of the box .
And so when you 're going to increase the box , your signal is expanding .
The bottom here is <unk> in the <unk> of mice .
And so when you put in another <unk> in the box , whether it 's a mouse , you have the <unk> of <unk> , which is the same place where cells are going to make the signal .
This means to understand the distance of <unk> -- the distances of the Milky Way , the <unk> and the direction for <unk> .
And indeed , in the <unk> of the mouse , we 're injecting signals in <unk> <unk> , and we 've measured the same amount of brain cells that are accessible to the environment .
And here 's the cells on the left , you can see , when the mouse is approaching the <unk> or the barrier , it will respond to cells , whether it 's an <unk> , or a <unk> box , and even a mouse box .
And the <unk> cells are in the field of the limb , and when it comes up in south , no matter whether this <unk> is <unk> , or even the <unk> of the wall , even two <unk> tables , even two <unk> tables .
And this is one of the ways that we 've been able to think of <unk> cells for animals .
And we 're also able to capture it in a simple environment , how to make -- like <unk> , or <unk> -- <unk> this object as your car .
We want people to be familiar with the environment , and we 're going to get that object .
And then , again , let 's go back to that environment , usually they 're all going to be <unk> in the position of memory .
But in some experiments , we will change the shape of environmental shape and scale , as we 're in the " <unk> cells . "
So , we can change the shape of the environment , and we 're going to try and understand how it happens .
So for example , you 've seen that , imagine this flag on <unk> <unk> , and then you ask people where people are , but you 're actually going to increase the scale of the environment , which is the same thing that 's going on in the world , where they think that the <unk> and the pattern of <unk> is expanding .
It 's kind of like a signal that you 're going to be <unk> from a specific place in a particular place , and then you go back to the place where you come back in the room , you can start to interact with your brain .
And this process is going to make you back back to the old place .
We can do it with <unk> .
And so when we go out -- maybe we 're going to walk down , and wherever we walk -- we can <unk> ourselves , because we could <unk> our movement to the other .
" The cells are also able to get cells from a cells called " <unk> cells . "
Now in the <unk> signals in <unk> , you 've found that " <unk> cells , " which is a little bit like " <unk> cells . "
And as a mouse is exploring , each neuron has been replaced by a lot of different areas of the cell cells , and in the entire environment , the whole system is made of an incredible <unk> <unk> .
If you look at a range of other <unk> cells -- in different colors , each cell is able to form <unk> , and in the entire environment , every cell signal is <unk> in other cells .
So the <unk> <unk> in the red line is the green one , and the blue is this .
So to look at it , it 's like mice can establish a virtual place where it comes to the environment -- that 's kind of like what you 're seeing on the map and the <unk> , but it 's just going to give you a <unk> <unk> .
And when the mouse moves , these sensors can use these cells to <unk> the next neuron for mouse cells , so that mice can understand itself in motion .
How do humans have <unk> cells ?
Because all of the <unk> <unk> have the same <unk> , and as well as the Grand Canyon , there 's the change in the orange line , which means that the brain is going to vary in a certain range of different parts of this brain , depending on the way that we are in six directions or two directions .
We can do it for people to be able to do a little video game at the same time , and then we 're going to show you a little bit about the signal .
<unk> , you see the <unk> cortex in the brain , and they 're seeing <unk> cells and mice that appear to the location of a brain .
Now look at the temple .
And he 's going to remember the relative distances between the neighborhood and the location of the sphere and the distance .
And that 's where it 's going to be done by the signals that <unk> the <unk> .
And he may remember how to go out from the parking , and this is the <unk> cell <unk> .
These two types of cells can replicate cells .
And so the way that he went through was to come up with the signals that were looking at what was going on in the form of <unk> and <unk> , and that 's the way to <unk> the form of the form of the brain , the way to <unk> the pattern .
And that would be able to be " old " in the ' 70s , " and the process of the end is not whether it 's going to be there , whether it 's still there .
Maybe the car is gone away .
But he still knows where to stop , so he will return to his car .
In the case of space , if we look at this <unk> signal in the entire brain , it 's a distribution of distribution , and when we need to recall some of the past , they 're going to be active at the same time , like , when you try to remember the experience of a wedding , as you 're trying to figure out what 's going on .
So it 's possible to see the functionality of neurons in the brain , and also the visual image of visual imagery , when we try to recall it , at least you can use it to think about the whole scene .
And if it 's true , the memory has begun to come in and say , " <unk> cells are activated by these sorts of connections , and " The <unk> <unk> " is re - activated and re - shaped the space of the sun .
<unk> cells are able to <unk> that space .
Another <unk> cell , I did n't say it 's like <unk> , and they 're based on your mailbox .
They can be very clear that you need to be in the head of the brain , and it 's going to take you to think about it .
All right , here 's the new history of cognitive neuroscience , and in this area , we start trying to understand the behavior of the brain , to try to figure out how human behavior is , you know , how people respond to human psychology , like people , or even thinking about how they recall , to think about it .
Thank you .

Imagine a collaborative -- much more authorities , more government , <unk> power -- it 's not just openness to open safety , but James <unk> , who 's from the <unk> of the modern era , and he 's going to tell you why to make the future safe to try and explain the world 's security .
collaboration , global issues , open - source , peace , politics , social media , violence , war

James <unk> : How to look at global security
And I 'm going to introduce you to some open safety problem , because we 're in the 21st century .
And we 'll start to look at the twentieth century , and then we can understand how safe it is to work for us .
This is <unk> , a French battle in the southern hill of the <unk> Sea in Belgium .
In <unk> , <unk> was killed in 300 people , which was about 2,000 people a day .
We continue to look at the safety of the 20th century -- to see the World War II -- and we 've seen it in <unk> , 300 million people in the <unk> .
We went into the Cold War , and we kept building <unk> .
We come from the slums of the World War II , to the South World Department of Second World War II , to the South World War , in the Cold War .
<unk> or <unk> .
So my theme today is to make the purpose of security , and we do n't build bridges , building bridges .
There 's a very famous bridge in Europe .
It 's in <unk> .
It 's a theme in <unk> , which is the theme of the author , and it tells a lot about how it 's going to be done in Europe and Central Europe .
And recently , in the decade , we started looking at these areas , even though some of the southern hemisphere began to expand together .
And I think again , open safety is about connecting different areas of the international , personal , private and public , and connected them through social networks .
So what I 'm going to talk about is why we need to do that , because our goal is that we 're suffering from threats , and there 's no threat , but not a threat .
Now , obviously I 'm a sailor .
There 's a boat swimming on the <unk> .
What 's the problem ?
That 's on the boat on the boat .
This is how to deliver <unk> .
It 's a very big global threat now . This is just the <unk> .
<unk> is still in <unk> .
It 's in <unk> .
In the area of the world .
It 's a hundred percent reduction in the global transportation .
In the last year , 20 boats were kidnapped .
This is a threat threat for global warming .
We need to figure out solutions .
Now let 's switch to another ocean , the sun 's ocean .
There are two images of the photos .
At the moment they were rejected .
They did a credit card , and administrators were more than <unk> .
This is just part of two trillion dollars for the global economy .
Two trillion dollars a year .
This is the U.S. GDP of the U.K.
So the Internet world , as we know , is the fundamental open source of openness , which is threatened by threats .
And the other thing that I 'm worried about is that the threats to the threat of the <unk> threats , which is <unk> , <unk> and <unk> from Afghanistan to Europe .
We worry from the north coast of the southern hemisphere , the West .
We worried about illegal forces , but most importantly , we worry about human mobility , and its cost .
Most of the transit is through the ocean , but through our <unk> .
This is a photo , and I want to tell you that it 's a very high - tech military Navy that 's going to stop it .
But the bad news is , this is the <unk> of a semi - <unk> device .
It was built in <unk> in South America .
We <unk> it with no technology , and it 's wearing the <unk> <unk> .
Four million , good equipment .
This brings up to the <unk> of God and <unk> , and the larger forces of God are not part of the threat of our inheritance .
Let 's look at Afghanistan today .
There 's a <unk> in Afghanistan .
8,000 to 90 percent of the world , <unk> and <unk> , came from Afghanistan .
And of course , we saw the war .
That 's where the site is building .
We see there 's a very shaky <unk> here .
So the risk of war is part of the threat we have to solve .
So , in the 21st century .
We know that we 're 20 in the 20th century .
What do we do ?
I want to say that we ca n't just use safety .
We ca n't just rely on the <unk> .
We need <unk> <unk> .
When we use , we have to use good .
But what I want to say is that openness safety is about international , <unk> , private and public communication , through Internet communication .
Let me give you an example .
We had Afghanistan , united in Afghanistan .
They all have books .
And you might say , " It 's really strange , I think I 've read that in this area , 30 percent of the young people in the area . "
You might be right .
When they go into <unk> , 90 percent is not born .
Why ? Because the Taliban learn education in these <unk> .
So the question is , why are they standing there ?
And the answer is , we 're reading them to read , through <unk> curriculum , by collaboration with private tissue .
We 've taught over 300 people in Afghanistan to the most basic universities .
When you read and write , you can put a pair of glasses in your pocket .
And in the <unk> , when these people graduated together , they were proud of the pen , and they put them in their pocket .
This is the movement that <unk> around the world -- the power of <unk> , the <unk> and the nurturing of the community , to connect with this safe building .
Now , of course , we 're teaching them , but I want to say , open safety means to make a safer security for <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This is an American Navy .
It 's called <unk> .
He had a <unk> <unk> called " <unk> . "
They 're the ones who are glamorous .
<unk> is on the coast of the <unk> and North America in North America .
Normally , he would take eight <unk> .
The <unk> personnel are not glamorous , but many humanitarian organizations , like , " <unk> <unk> . "
Other organizational volunteers .
The doctors in the other sector arrived .
They were part of the project .
To give you an example of this project , this child , eight years old , and his mother came up for two days to the <unk> clinic .
When he <unk> his pill , he suddenly looked , and he said , " <unk> , <unk> <unk> . "
" Mom , I see the world . "
<unk> this 10 to eight , and that personal relationship , the relationship between the private and the public , is the project of <unk> security , beginning to start to create safety .
This is a photo <unk> .
Can you find the <unk> soldiers in the United States ?
They 're the ones who are the most <unk> , and this is part of a baseball marketing , where we try to <unk> the <unk> of the military , which is , in fact , who can really fight in a military <unk> and get it to the U.S. and <unk> -- and then it creates a lot of <unk> in the city , to get a <unk> - to - peer - , - a - half - year - old .
And he came up with models of young men and lives , and I want to say that these ideas help create security .
Another part of this cooperation is that <unk> and <unk> work .
This is a soldier in the United States , and it came to the tsunami of an innocent person who killed the tsunami .
And in all of the disaster -- in 2004 , the <unk> <unk> died , Pakistan , in 2005 , <unk> people died in Haiti , Bangalore , pandemics , people die in the earthquake of Japanese machines , and we 've seen a lot about the International <unk> Red Center , where we see the international <unk> and the safety of this <unk> .
So these are the examples that we 're talking about .
We <unk> this together , and we <unk> it .
Now you see this , and you 're thinking , " Ah , <unk> , these are the tools of communication , or light . "
No , this is an extremely glamorous map .
The purple is <unk> , green is the workplace .
The white is integration .
This is very surprising to think about the nucleus , six billion people -- China , India , Facebook , Twitter , the American , in Indonesia .
What do we do ?
Why do we want to ?
We talked about the political campaign of the Arab Spring Foundation , and its power .
I 'm going to give you one example of how information can spread .
I wrote a talk in London like this , and I said , I 'm going to tell you about Facebook , I 'm in Facebook .
<unk> .
This is an essay on <unk> .
There are two places in the world , Finland and Indonesia .
The title is : <unk> <unk> needs to be friends .
Thank you .
I 'll do it .
This story is a whole bunch of people , and I 'll have hundreds of Facebook friends and ask , from Indonesia and Finland , most of them say , " <unk> , what do you hear you need to do ? "
So .
Well , we 're laughing , but this is how we spread information , and how you 're going to make international , different organizations , private institutions and social networks to create safe .
Now , let me say a serious news .
This is a picture of a spectacular British soldier .
He 's in <unk> .
This is in <unk> , in southern Afghanistan .
I put him out of the way to remind us , and I do n't want anyone to leave this room , <unk> the idea of military force .
And this is exactly what we 're doing here , and we do this thing for free , whether it 's going to work in our society .
But you know , life is not steering .
We do n't either either , either in war , or in <unk> .
I think life is a <unk> <unk> .
You need a factor , and as I think we should think about how we 're going to build safe in the 21st century , we need to use a real force in real war and crisis , as we 've already talked about , that our military , the <unk> , is part of the security , in communication , to connect with the world .
In the end , I 'd like to say that some of the things that we heard earlier earlier today -- I 've always used Wikipedia , as you know , Wikipedia is n't about 12 smart people in the house , and it 's not going to make it go into the room .
The Wikipedia is <unk> by tens of thousands of people every day , millions , hundreds of people .
It does n't have a single person who thinks more smart than anyone thought .
There is no one , without a community , no country , we think more .
And Wikipedia is very simple : create a world that can be free to share with everyone .
So , I want to say , by connecting international , mesh , <unk> power , strategy , strategies , we can create collective security .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
One , it 's a very glamorous planet , and it has beautiful ring .
But for scientists , this ring has a special meaning because we believe that they represent the size of a small size .
Some scientists believe that the solar system is forming , and when the sun comes up , there 's a lot of dust around it , so there are some things around the Grand Canyon and then forming the planets and form the planet .
And the idea is , look at the lens of Saturn , we can understand how we formed the solar system , like a test platform .
Let me show you some <unk> systems .
First , let 's switch on to Saturn .
Now , all of this is true .
This is not animation , or anything .
This is actually the <unk> of the satellite Saturn Saturn .
And you can see the details of a large explosion of <unk> .
Some of these accumulate are formed together .
This is why Saturn <unk> , because it formed a little satellite in that place .
Now you think these seals are big .
Yeah , they 're very , very big in the middle , but it 's very thin and extremely thin .
This is the shadow of Saturn Saturn .
This is one of the satellites that 's built out of the form .
So imagine it 's a thin thin , <unk> region , thousands of miles away .
It 's going to be made out of all sorts of platforms , and every one of them has to do it over the last few decades , to explain the things that we need to have more money to explore why these things are spreading , or why it 's forming .
There are two very interesting things that are very interesting .
A name called <unk> .
This <unk> is made from orbit .
But something very unusual .
If you look at these <unk> , we call it the <unk> spray , and when we flew into them , then we found that temperature goes down , it 's more than anywhere else on the planet .
When we fly on the left , guess it .
We saw <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> .
We see ice ice vessels from the Earth . It 's probably possible to have the ocean , right below the surface .
And since the effects effect , we have these <unk> out of <unk> .
And I 'm going to show you the distance , and it 's 30 miles ago , which we 've asked <unk> <unk> , so we can actually measure physical material .
40 miles tall , because we worry about risk , but what it does .
In the top of the <unk> , we found a lot of organic ice ice cream .
And after a few years , we 're going to continue to zoom in and zoom into the surface , and we 're going to move towards the surface .
Now the other moon has been focused on the attention of <unk> , and the reason is that it 's a very , very mesh - y moon , which has the atmosphere .
The atmosphere is roughly roughly the atmosphere .
If you 're on top , you feel the same <unk> , like in Earth . It 's made of a little bit of atmosphere .
The methane is <unk> , because it 's organic , people think that life can evolve , if you find organic .
People believe that the origin of life , because it 's completely organic , it ca n't generate biological matter , so it can have life .
It 's like the Earth , and it 's 30 billion years and then it starts alive .
So it 's interesting to show you a couple of examples that we 've got a probe that 's been developed by our colleagues in Europe , where we 're running out of our European colleagues , and there 's a detector around the <unk> of Europe .
We took a probe to the atmosphere .
This image is the region we fall down .
It 's like the coast of California .
You can see the river crossing the coast , and the white region is like Carter <unk> , looking like a sea .
From the <unk> device , a radar detector , we found that lakes , like this <unk> , is like Earth .
It looks like the river , the ocean or lakes , there 's clouds . We think there are <unk> .
Very similar to the Earth , but it 's very cold , not water , no water .
These are the things that look like liquid and <unk> and methane , and it 's like joining into something like gas .
This planet is very similar to this planet , but it 's based on <unk> and methane .
If you 're on top , you do n't have to worry about four dollars .
It 's going to be in the neighborhood , and you can do it with <unk> .
On the other hand , if you 're in a <unk> planet , it will blow up .
And then I 'd like to end with the end of the needle .
This is to think about it , and this is the picture of the sun from Saturn , looking at the image of Saturn 's eyes , from behind Saturn .
And the sun is Saturn , and we call it <unk> <unk> . I can zoom in on the <unk> of Saturn .
I do n't really know if you can see , in <unk> , at the end , there 's a black hole , that 's Earth .
We can see our planet . I zoom in .
When you zoom in , you can see Earth , it 's in the middle , so we 're going to zoom into art centers .
Thank you very much .

In the TED conference , Daniel <unk> demos innovation in the next few years , through new tools , testing and programming , directly to the patient 's bed .

Daniel Cohen : The future of medicine , maybe a scheme for cell phones
I came up with a couple of years ago when I was on the TED conference , and I met <unk> .
In fact , we 've seen it in the Internet -- not like what you want .
We know because we all recognize <unk> <unk> , one of the founders of private gene companies .
And because we share our genetic information with <unk> , she knows that <unk> and I have a very rare DNA -- <unk> <unk> -- which means we 're facing .
In fact , we 're all working with <unk> <unk> .
Yeah . <unk> , <unk> and I .
And of course , we have our own <unk> group .
Welcome to you .
When I met <unk> in the second TED conference , she gathered the <unk> museum of our own delight .
Why do I tell you about this story , what does this relationship with the future ?
In fact , I 've seen a good example of what 's going on in the <unk> of the subject , and the technology of <unk> - growth technologies to influence the health of our future and health care -- from low - scale genes , from <unk> genes to the Internet .
And what I want to talk about today is understanding technology growth .
We often think of linear thinking .
But imagine if you have a leopard <unk> , it divided every day -- two , four , eight , 16 , 15 days later .
What do you think there 's a billion months later ? We 'll have a billion .
If we start thinking about it , we 'll see how it affected us .
A lot of technology -- like a physicist and the Grand Canyon -- we can really begin to really start to use the current health care and legitimacy , and to talk about the major challenges of the world and talk a lot about how many people are at the age of aging , where we do n't really use information .
One of the things that we talk about today is that the main thing is to send the curve to the <unk> .
Most of us spend most of the money in the last 20 years .
If we can invest in the health care system , where we 're going to move on the left - health health system and move this curve , then what do we do ?
My favorite technology , the example of nanotechnology , in our pockets .
So if you want to look , you 'll notice that these technologies are really increasing .
I mean the iPhone 's four .
Imagine what the iPhone will do .
Now , I have some vision .
And I looked at the <unk> of new university schools , and it was <unk> Silicon Valley .
Every summer we <unk> around the world very talented students .
We study these <unk> technologies from medicine , <unk> , AI , robotics , technology , space technologies , to find how to train a major deal of purpose and use these techniques to make a difference .
We have a seven - year - old solution .
And the next few months of the project is that the future of medical medicine , for example , helps us use technology to use medicine .
Now I 'm going to tell you now .
And these phones have over two different kinds of applications -- a different , very different .
And that 's what you can do with a little chip on your iPhone , where you 're <unk> from the <unk> epidemic .
I do n't know if I 'm going to do it , but it does .
There 's a whole range of techniques that allow you to connect with your telephone , like -- for example , your iPhone measuring the data , allowing them to be able to figure out how to understand you as a <unk> .
Now , let 's look at the evolution of <unk> health .
Let 's start with speed .
We all know , according to Moore , computers speed speed .
So we can do something more powerful .
They 're approaching , in many cases , beyond the ability to think .
But I think the best place for me is <unk> technology .
This technology can look at the inside of the body , and it 's really amazing .
We 're dealing with multiple technologies -- <unk> scans , CT scans and molecules -- finding and looking for different levels .
This is where you 're going to see a very high - <unk> scan scan , which is by TEDMED Mark .
Now we can see inside the brain , we 've never had the ability to actually learn how to fix , and maybe even design , or reverse design -- and so we understand better understanding of <unk> , disease , treat .
We can look at the surface of the brain , watching the inside -- in the brain , inside the brain .
By understanding these processes and connection , we can understand the effects of medicine , or achieve more effective and urgency , for example , <unk> .
It 's become smaller than these studies , and it 's cheaper , more <unk> .
And the data that comes from this research is almost a challenge .
The scans of the scans today are about 800 books , or <unk> .
This scan will be <unk> , or 80 million volumes .
How do you use these information ?
Let 's start with <unk> analysis , and I wo n't ask anybody who 's going to be <unk> , but if you 've been 50 years old , it 's time to get <unk> .
How do you avoid the <unk> of <unk> ?
Now there is a virtual <unk> .
And these two graphs , right now , as an intruder , you can <unk> your patient with artificial intelligence , but the potential , like you see here , this is a harm .
Oh , we 're going to stop it , but in the <unk> we can find the harm injury .
This may be <unk> people to do something that people do n't want to be doing .
This is an example of an organ .
We then tease up the <unk> of <unk> , technology , wireless methods , I want to say , now , <unk> medicine .
So even my <unk> are also digital .
And of course , it 's a grammar .
Obviously we 're going to get to the Grand Canyon .
So the <unk> engine is basically beyond and replace the <unk> .
It 's now 10 million <unk> or <unk> dollars -- now , about 5,000 dollars , I can afford a very powerful diagnostic device .
<unk> this device and the electronic medical records -- in the United States , <unk> percent is less than 20 percent .
And in the Netherlands , I think this is more than 80 percent .
But now we 're going to take it to the <unk> medical data , which allows us to focus on information resources . Now , I can look at my patient 's data .
And of course , we 're not even at the beginning of the day .
The first last month is <unk> the <unk> of the spray on these devices .
I mean , the doctors today , including my own , completely dependent on those devices .
As you 've seen about a month ago from IBM , the <unk> <unk> won two winners .
And so I want you to imagine that when we start with the next couple of years of information , then we really have real artificial intelligence to use our brains to make decisions and conservatives to determine the decision and diagnostic .
Now , in many cases , you do n't need to look at doctors .
It 's only about 20 percent of the time to see doctors .
We 're at the beginning of the Virtual <unk> -- from some kind of <unk> video , from a few of these very complex health surveys .
This is a different relationship between the health of health - sharing , and the ability to raise your health care .
Now we 're interacting with these tools that are already being enhanced by these <unk> .
This is my friend <unk> sending me the photos of her head , so she does n't use the <unk> -- I can do it through the photo .
Or we might be able to use the video of the game today , like Microsoft <unk> , for example , diagnosed with surgery , such as diagnostic , using <unk> equipment .
We actually use robots for patients -- this is <unk> ; if I 'm a <unk> expert , or a hospital .
If you have a whole set of tools in home , these tools help us change each other .
Imagine that we 've got Wi - Fi <unk> .
You can stand up there .
You can tell your weight to the weight of your friends , they can make you laugh .
We have wireless <unk> .
A whole technology is integrated together .
So we do n't have to paste these structures on a simple bladder .
The colleagues in the Stanford colleagues developed <unk> -- it 's much more efficient than ever before .
Now we 're at the age of mechanical self .
They can buy <unk> equipment like this little <unk> .
I can calculate my <unk> and heat .
I can do it every day .
I can share these data with friends .
These are the lines that can measure <unk> , called <unk> <unk> -- a whole tool that allows you to benefit and understand your own health .
When we start organizing information , we understand what to do with it , how to understand our own <unk> , health and benefits .
Now you can measure your <unk> rate .
I 'm going to say , in the future , we 'll have a device in our clothing , <unk> .
As we 're wearing <unk> systems in the car , your light folds -- it does n't say " <unk> engine . "
It will be " <unk> <unk> , " and it 's got to be careful .
Maybe it 's a few years later , you 're going to get it wrong .
And for you to take kids in home , you feel that wireless <unk> helps you .
I think there are more information than you need .
But it would be here .
Now we 've heard a lot of technology .
I think there are technologies that are going to make us connect to our patients , to save more and more of the interaction of medical communication , and that technology is able to promote these connections .
Now we 've talked about the <unk> of the patient .
So what about the <unk> of the doctor ?
We 're in the <unk> of a doctor who can be able to get the robot inside the body , and now they 're going to be the fact that the reality is , even five years ago .
Now this technology is a lot of technology that enhances reality as well .
The doctors are able to see the patients inside the patient , where the blood is .
This can be accompanied with decision - sharing .
For example , a doctor in New York can help the other doctors in Amsterdam .
We 're here in a real <unk> surgery called <unk> <unk> , which is the way that robots go through the <unk> .
This is called " <unk> , " which is -- basically , <unk> surgery , through robot surgery .
How do you control other elements ?
And for <unk> -- for example -- this is the brain - changing era , or the computer activity -- or <unk> , in the cortex , <unk> the wing , and they 're able to create a remote control or an <unk> or a <unk> arm , a arm arm .
These devices become smaller and smaller .
Despite clinical trials , but imagine that when we can link these technologies , like , a stunning <unk> arm , as <unk> <unk> , and his colleagues are designed to have the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> -- and it 's 17 degrees of people who have already had the same arm in the past .
We actually really go into a robot that used to be used .
If you do n't lose a limb -- well , you have a stroke -- you can wear these arms .
Or if you 're a <unk> patient -- as I visited at the conference of Dr. <unk> Lab -- they 've invented the <unk> legs .
I took this video last week . This is a <unk> patient walking through the <unk> .
If you do n't do that , he 's totally dependent on <unk> .
This is the early age of the robot .
And I think we can change the definition of these techniques to become <unk> , in some cases , to become <unk> or <unk> .
This is Amy <unk> , and she lost a lot of money in the age of a child , a professor 's professor , MIT , who had lost his body .
They can do better than our regular <unk> , moving faster , move in different directions .
What about other industries ?
Obviously obesity is moving through the wrong direction , including very large distances .
But in medicine , this trend is accelerating .
A couple of examples : we 're now at the beginning of " weird journey . "
You can see the installation that 's completely completely <unk> .
It 's able to make a picture in your gut , when it comes through your mailbox , help you <unk> and therapeutic .
We 're interested in a little smaller robot that will ultimately be able to do what you can do with a doctor 's doctor , using a bad way .
Sometimes these devices may be able to self - assemble with your <unk> , to improve its values .
For the heart surgery , the cars are more easy to put it , so you do n't have to train a wrist surgeon to put them .
They 're going to be <unk> by your mobile phone , and you can go to any place .
These devices are becoming smaller .
This is a sample of a quarter - year - old , taller than five pounds .
The functionality of <unk> retina is to focus on the eye at the bottom of the patient to get the blind vision .
It 's still early at early stages , but there 's a good deal for it .
These techniques will be <unk> .
For anyone who 's a problem for our vision , what is the <unk> of these <unk> ?
<unk> , Wi - Fi -- <unk> images to your eye .
If you ca n't sustain the <unk> , some images might help remind you how much ice is .
So what can we do with their mobile phones to be able to see the data back into the street to make it better ?
In fact , the whole experiment changed entirely .
We can make <unk> , like the <unk> of the Stanford <unk> company .
<unk> can replace the whole laboratory .
Put it on a chip , and you can do thousands of tests in the world .
It 's going to really be really <unk> for the <unk> of the village and the safety of those areas that allow you to go through the past , to get a lot of money in care .
If you look at this little path , we 're going to come back to <unk> medicine , allowing you to do it smaller than we can design the blood ceiling , or a <unk> robot to monitor our blood system or the sun or even even <unk> .
What if it 's more cheap ?
In the area of medicine , it 's not exactly what we normally think , but the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> dollars .
In genomics , the genome is about 10 billion years ago when the first genome appeared .
We can actually buy a thousand dollars per year . Maybe the genome of 100 dollars will come up .
What do we do with 100 dollars ?
Soon we can run millions of tests .
That 's when it becomes interesting when we start to focus on information .
We 're going into real personal medicine -- in the right time of the correct world -- rather than now , instead of doing this , it 's not like us , giving everyone to each other -- a drug that does n't work .
A lot of different companies are using these methods .
I 'll give you a simple example , or a <unk> .
And my data suggests that I 've reached the average <unk> , a blind stroke .
But if I get to the same data , like I can see , I have to see my risk of <unk> diabetes .
I have about two times the risk of <unk> diabetes .
So , for example , I would like to see how many and a half minutes later .
This may change my behavior .
With the knowledge of my genes -- how my gene <unk> , what my medicine does with me , and what I need to do is to make a difference between the individuals and the patients , to take better medicine and take advantage .
So not only gene , there are multiple factors -- our habits , our environments .
So , what do you live in ?
<unk> : Where are you alive , you 've got a huge impact on your health .
We can break this information .
So genomics , proteomics , environment , all kinds of data come back to us as individuals , and how do we manage them ?
We 're entering the system , and we 're starting to start with the systems of the system , and we start organizing these information .
And through these patterns , for example , one of the tests in our blood pressure is that we can see these little patterns that are very early in really early <unk> .
The founder of this area , Lee <unk> called this method for <unk> medicine .
We will predict ; we can know what we might do .
We can prevent that ; this gains can be personalized ; more importantly , it will become shared .
Despite some of the sites like <unk> <unk> , Microsoft <unk> or Google can manage data , use the methods for sharing data .
I 'm going to end with a better adventure .
We have better therapies .
We 're usually at the cost of medicine .
And if we have a new <unk> nerve , the blood vessel helps to <unk> blood pressure , and you can heal the blood pressure .
This is a new device that does this .
It should also be done in the <unk> .
How do you get <unk> cancer insurance ?
Well , I 'm <unk> , and I have to say that most of the medicine we have is actually <unk> .
We learned that in our Stanford and other places we could find cancer stem cells that could be cancer <unk> .
If you look at the cancer as a seed , we normally <unk> this seed .
It 's like <unk> , but it 's often <unk> .
So we 're taking the wrong target .
<unk> stem cells still died in a few months or two months later .
We 've learned that <unk> stem cells look like a target for a long time .
We 're entering into the personalized era , using the ability to use all of the data , to analyze the tumor and try to connect each patient for every patient .
And finally , I 'll talk about <unk> medicine .
I have a lot of <unk> for stem cells -- <unk> stem cells .
We have adult stem cells around us .
We put these stem cells together .
<unk> last year , the first attempt for <unk> stem cells to <unk> the spinal cord .
It 's still at the beginning , but it 's progress .
We 've used stem cells into a clinical trial about 15 years in different projects , especially <unk> .
We take our own <unk> for heart disease , and we can see that the heart function improves and grew up after the disease attack .
I invented a device called bone <unk> , which is a way to collect <unk> .
It 's been used by the FDA , and it 's going to work in the middle of the <unk> .
And hope you 're going to be able to do this kind of device to the patient 's body , and it 's about 200 times a day in the human body , and it 's going to be a <unk> .
But what about the power of stem cells ?
If you think about it , every cell in your body has the same DNA when you 're embryo .
We can now <unk> your skin cells like a <unk> stem cell using this technology that might treat the other patient -- building your own personal stem cells .
I think that this will be a new era of your own stem cell in your body , and you can use your muscle in the fridge , but it can be the muscle cells that you need to use .
And we now now have these technologies as a whole cell era , and we 're able to <unk> a <unk> technology for 3D organs -- using cells to <unk> a 3D organ .
This is what the future looks like at the beginning .
But I think , as a nanotechnology technology , this is an example .
In recent recent years , when you think about how technology affects health and medicine , we 're entering into <unk> .
And I think it 's going to be together , if we start thinking about how to understand and use these technologies , we will make the patient better , and the ability to increase the benefits .
Because I know that , as a doctor , I 've got a lot of joy , and I 'm happy -- we can always cure them .
But unfortunately , for example , cancer three years or four years .
And by analyzing these techniques , I think we 're going to go into a new era , and I 'll call it zero medicine .
As a cancer doctor , I expected work .
Thank you so much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Namaste . Yves .

And here , I 'm going to read a couple of times more about adolescence .
And the <unk> of this subject , I personally , is quite glamorous .
And the <unk> Poetry singer was a very glamorous man , his career .
It 's called " <unk> . "
My grandmother was clean up my mouth , and she had a lot of fun in her shadow . She was <unk> .
And it 's all because I say , " No , that 's the " repeat . "
But she was bald . She said , " <unk> . "
She 's hugging my brain .
And I know she 's a cruel age of her <unk> , her three daughters , and her husband died in their children , they 're young .
She made me stand in front of the <unk> because there 's no toilets in the room .
But she did n't look at her .
So what does it have to do with my lips ?
She 's got two <unk> of the road , and she did n't have two nice rooms , a <unk> kitchen , which she 's all in my yard , <unk> me .
And I was grateful for me to do that , and I was grateful to do that ?
She was at the moment , and she was still <unk> , she had never seen before , until I did n't ever expect it until she did it .
This is my uncle on the magazine of magazine , and my uncle came up with a <unk> letter .
" Your love for <unk> is a great woman . "
I explain it .
It 's called " <unk> . "
It 's a <unk> .
And the moment that my personal experience was <unk> , when I woke up every morning , the first one was called " <unk> <unk> " and the sound of the <unk> ' voice , <unk> the voice in the evening , and he had a lot of <unk> -- and she was going to hit the car and then she went into the house and went down to his house , to the bottom of his day , which was a very , very good day to be <unk> at the same time , so that the woman who
Some of the women who are not going to have never been able to change the important gathering of dance , and somebody who wants to do n't stop the face of these days , the faces of women , who have n't heard of their face , <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , which is a little bit more <unk> .
And the ones that I saw were like a <unk> in the dark kitchen , where you 're very strong at the <unk> of the kitchen .
Of course , the men who have died in the face do n't exist unless anyone is n't permanent , and you 're <unk> , or a subtitle , a rugby coach , <unk> the <unk> of your friends , when you get older , you will never feel that you 've got to feel your father 's son , as you grow down to the next person , to <unk> a person who 's not going to bite you , but you 'll reject the other person .
And the last , <unk> <unk> , despite the joy of what 's going to happen to us -- how much blame of <unk> and communication , which does n't have any <unk> pain , and then you have .
And what we 've seen is that the age of our age injuries do n't have to deal with ? Even women , <unk> , wear up their best <unk> and <unk> -- even in the face of their hand , even with their hands , to <unk> the <unk> of the dog , and they 've got the pain associated with the enemy , who 's <unk> their own mate , so they 're going to be <unk> .
The village was approaching city , farm , <unk> , cows , and each other -- and you 're going to see , a huge amount of <unk> -- you can see that they 're mountains and forests . You can think they 're mountains and forests .
Or even more than half the streets of the ice , in the jungle , like a <unk> animal , and the <unk> , the cow , is just trying to make it easy , but when they called you , never go back .
This is another <unk> about young young people .
<unk> : <unk> .
This is part of the time we share with our shared space .
It 's called " neighbors . "
She <unk> the <unk> of my window on the floor , and I had the window .
She knows how much it is , and she knows what 's going on in her carpet .
She <unk> her on the door , and she goes down the flow of the <unk> and the sound of music -- because it 's the filter , because its filter goes into the hall .
At the time , this is Chris <unk> 's life -- how to go back to my university , and my first love , who was left to me -- who had the same record .
In my eye , my hand was in my mailbox , <unk> , agnostics , who was too young , because I was very young .
So , starting , <unk> , wait .
And I think she 's going to end the street in this village . She 's my neighbor .
And my idea is that we 're willing to engage with each other , to become friends , I think .
I saw her letters , actually .
The king of the white yellow hair , the military king , her <unk> , she left her , and she would n't say , " Hello . "
Sometimes there 's a scary <unk> , it 's a <unk> .
A man called " <unk> ! " " The crazy dog <unk> , <unk> and she -- her voice , almost only one logo , and almost one noise , which is almost a logo ; it 's a <unk> that goes back and forth .
My name is <unk> <unk> back . "
She <unk> her next next day .
And the surprising thing , <unk> , is still <unk> in the middle of the mailbox , the <unk> flakes , she <unk> around her path , her mouth <unk> suddenly , and she 's going to open his mouth , it 's like a <unk> .
And so , <unk> , it does n't have a voice , a lot of love , or whatever it does .
These are the signals that are non - <unk> , and they 're all <unk> .
<unk> girl , my old love , when she saw me in the party , she was hanging out of her dance , and she had her toes on her head , looking at her <unk> .
My <unk> , my <unk> is very gentle , and my lower line .
That 's the roof of life , the toes of the ice , <unk> a dog , <unk> a dog .
What 's going to be so vulnerable by the pain , what you 've seen in the past ?
There 's a lot of life in our lives , so many of the <unk> that we have .
" Looking at me , " <unk> love . "
She 's got rid of her <unk> <unk> , and she goes on to me .
I grabbed my door .
She goes through <unk> <unk> , and she 's on the street , <unk> and <unk> , and I " Can you help me ? "
And I grabbed my arm , she <unk> her .
She becomes the step of the world .
She <unk> , " Thank you love . Goes back to me .
I think I 'm going to take a little bit .
Another one , that 's about the debt and the ' 80s .
It 's called " <unk> . "
And that was n't good , and I thought , " <unk> Lady lady in the doctor 's doctor , ' <unk> ' [ <unk> ] ' <unk> ' [ <unk> ] ' <unk> ' <unk> ' " <unk> ' " ] [ " Academy <unk> " ] [ " Academy <unk> <unk> ' <unk> ] ' " <unk> "
<unk> is n't good , and if your gut gas looks like this , she can see that she 's really wasteful , only <unk> my face , just just hitting my face .
And this is a nice accident that 's been a good accident , and when we walk into our walk , my dog is stunned by <unk> , like <unk> .
And so I 'm so bad that I was 12 years old , and I would do this weekend in my weekend , when he was in the weekend -- even more powerful , much bigger , a huge amount of bang .
And the face of women writing <unk> <unk> , her " <unk> " and I forgot to forget , not at least a part of awe , and that 's what he 's going to do .
Hello ! Kim ! Marc !
Some of the books that have never been told with the <unk> are <unk> in those days .
All of these <unk> , <unk> frames , from the animal kingdom , is activated from animals , and it 's breathing , breathing .
It 's called " <unk> . "
And so many of you , in fact , most of my grandparents are cities , and I 'm going to read it in a centrifuge .
" Found . "
And I went with a woman , six months a day , <unk> <unk> , and a day , she suddenly laughed every day .
We <unk> each other .
I do n't think that <unk> , <unk> , is n't going to be <unk> .
She 's glamorous , she 's <unk> , she 's 95 percent .
I was scared . I felt like a child .
I 'm worried that some of you might be injured , and I 'll never leave it in her <unk> .
It 's not just the <unk> , but not only in the surface of the details , and it 's a very powerful , powerful social , moral mating , chaotic anger , depression , despair .
Some of the time , I wanted to bring her home , <unk> her , she , her clothing .
She does n't need me , I believe .
And conversely , I wanted to <unk> my train .
How to keep it , I think , <unk> our self - <unk> .
How to do that , we 're afraid of <unk> this idea of thinking about <unk> .
Our eye dance , conflict , through each other , to <unk> our senses , and <unk> , <unk> .
And her <unk> , I know .
She lives , she 's really angry .
Our eyes , our challenge , give dance , <unk> , and <unk> .
This is a <unk> , a new one .
It 's called " That 's all happened . "
A student , <unk> <unk> , who was working on the <unk> of an open - <unk> speaker , and the teacher 's wife talks about her -- teachers and <unk> to <unk> her , so you might think that almost a little bit of the most clever , a girl who does n't want to go to her face , but it 's going to be <unk> in the middle , which is that she ca n't even see it .
She 's down there .
An accident , a fantasy , never thought about it , even though it 's hard to think .
Not more <unk> or <unk> , she knows what she does , and she means , " Well , because she 's looking at it , it 's the beauty of her beautiful , dark , light , whatever she is , but she ca n't see what 's going on in her face , or she has no idea of what it is that she thinks that there 's so much <unk> and planning , which is a self - <unk> who does n't know what is going to be <unk> ; and that 's a <unk> that is
That 's the world .
That 's the world , but never completely existed .
And that kind of thing , which is so important for me , is that it 's much more important for me .
And the girl who realized that , in this infinite moment , she felt that she did n't know she thought she was just alive .
Yes , girls fell down , she was <unk> , even Earth and <unk> she had to know , it was ridiculous , and that girl would n't belong to me or her , but self - aware .
Take <unk> of dignity .
It 's already happening .
I 'm going to read one , not my habit .
I like it just like this .
But I 'm afraid of <unk> <unk> , and then I <unk> her license .
" No , <unk> , good . "
A special <unk> magazine in our neighborhood .
She forgot her mother .
<unk> , clean mouth , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is still flat , but it 's almost better than the panda bear .
Maybe it 's a sexy American in the age of time , never seen the desire to leave me with the <unk> of the eye .
That 's always the end of the knot , always , if I 'm not in a wish .
And God knows , although there 's a huge amount of <unk> .
Last year in Israel , a young <unk> <unk> passed through <unk> , some girls who ca n't find a room .
Because there 's a <unk> figure .
On the photo of the show , men and women are <unk> clothing , some attempt to <unk> their toes , not <unk> , the white background , <unk> waiting for a <unk> .
The girls , my fears , avoid them .
It 's a teacher who does n't trust them .
Even the other <unk> of <unk> , once in <unk> books , <unk> defies documents , a <unk> and torture is absolutely <unk> <unk> .
I found myself in her page .
She died in <unk> , and I ca n't think about why -- more and more , more <unk> .
There 's a lot of people dying in refugee camps -- or Jews sustain the situation .
But it 's like sex , you 're not told .
<unk> and death , how do you get rid of them ?
So , now I 'm going to think about death , and sometimes I think I 'm makers .
My wife 's cute little <unk> .
My passion for her passion is much more profound .
And when we did that , she did n't have me at all .
My head now , my voice does n't know I live in my life , like I 'm <unk> .
And then I went down , and I had to leave her , in despair , everything , all <unk> , terrible , scary .
But you can die in particular , without <unk> , or <unk> .
And not knowing the future of the history of history or anesthesia , it might be a <unk> .
No , no .
I 'm not exaggerating .
I mean , this world makes me good , or not bad , but my <unk> and <unk> <unk> do n't have her <unk> , she was so glamorous that she had a <unk> .
Yeah . <unk> . Yves .
These are the signals she knows in her <unk> .
She 's going to do a lot of help in despair , looking at our passion , to live in nice , vivid , <unk> , if you do n't do it .
Thank you .

This image is just documenting history -- they 've created history . In the TED university , <unk> <unk> shows us some of the most iconic photos that we 've ever seen , and he tells us how they ca n't care about the photos that they ca n't look at , when they 're not concerned about what they do n't think of as they can not be paying attention to the picture when the generation is ever looking at the photo , and when you see them not to pay attention about it , she 's going to

<unk> <unk> : A picture of the world
The people who are trying to be able to do this is to change the world .
Well , we are naive , and we 're <unk> with toes and tails .
In fact , we all know that the image itself does n't change the world , but we also know it 's going to be released , and the photos are affecting the population .
I 'll show you a couple of guys .
If you did n't recognize them , I would be surprised .
These are the images that are called " <unk> <unk> . "
In fact , they 're very famous . They recognize another form of forms .
I think we 're going to do that .
We need more .
We need images of those who do n't have any compromise on the question , beyond the image of the religious , the photos of religious imagery , which makes us tick . That 's , to change .
This painting , you 've seen .
It changed our cognitive knowledge .
We 've never seen our planet .
There 's a lot of people who 've been able to see this Earth 's first time , and it 's so small that it is so small that it 's fragile .
40 years later , these environmental groups , historically , realized that the species of our species are <unk> .
And then we started doing this .
These <unk> are acting in different ways .
So , for example , <unk> <unk> shot these photos in Congo .
These are people who are <unk> , and you 're going to say that they 're <unk> in the <unk> .
Recently , the earthquake in Haiti , let 's realize that Nature itself is in nature .
I think that the <unk> of the human race are much more terrible than that .
<unk> <unk> , one of the founders of <unk> once said to us , is the <unk> of nature , even though it 's the most glamorous , <unk> person who does n't have a <unk> and moral principle .
We have other subjects .
And the <unk> images of the United States <unk> , and these <unk> pictures have been created by <unk> .
Start with these pictures themselves , their public , to make government change .
Some people think that these are the images of the <unk> of Iraq , and they 're more influential than anything else .
And also , these images are permanent <unk> called moral <unk> .
Let 's start in the history of history .
In the rest of the century , the image of Vietnam and the Vietnam War bear on television .
The news photography made people face the war to face wars in the face of a war , a <unk> <unk> who was elected an army in Ohio State <unk> .
In fact , these pictures became the most powerful <unk> sound .
Now , the photo has led to the power of disbelief with <unk> , especially the problems of AIDS -- I 've done a lot of it .
And in the late 80s , all sorts of people who do n't want to talk a lot about it , to talk about it .
In 1987 , one of the most famous women in the world has done a simple thing , <unk> <unk> , a baby of HIV / AIDS . This is a movement for AIDS , especially Europe .
She was more aware of the power of most people .
When we 're facing a picture of influence , we can be able to do it . We can see that there are more people .
And it 's a good thing to do , when these images came out of the U.K. , people started looking at it , and then people were going to pay a lot of money for <unk> .
Does it change the world ?
No , they 've got <unk> .
It often makes us believe that our beliefs and our responsibility for each other .
We 've seen images of <unk> <unk> , and I think these images have a lot of impact on millions of people .
At the end of the 2008 <unk> , I do n't think that the photo is almost impossible .
Unfortunately , some of the most important photos , because it 's really " real . "
There 's one . This is the Hewlett - Packard <unk> for a <unk> <unk> who has never been published ; it 's called " War , " which is called " War . "
Let 's think about the photos of war , not necessarily .
John Moore took this photo in <unk> .
And so many of the conflict that has happened in the world has been the most <unk> of all the photos that came out of this world , and it was the most glamorous part of the world .
<unk> <unk> said , " People have never seen the shot . They made it . "
I do n't have the <unk> , but you .
We <unk> every photo of each photo , and our own values , our faith , we 've created a creator .
My company had <unk> photos .
I have a whole office .
That 's it .
And I hope the next time you see a picture of your inspiration , the best way to think about it , and I 'm clearly clear that the audience 's going to do something .
Thank you all .

Ben <unk> : Take the Arctic
This is me . That 's Ben <unk> .
I was really good at the place where I was in the dark .
Last five months , I was standing in the <unk> .
There was a six - year - old big diving diving in <unk> square , and I was the only man .
2,000 people came to <unk> .
There 's 12 people standing on the moon .
And there was only four people involved in the Arctic to Arctic .
And I think this is because -- -- thank you -- that 's because it 's like Chris .
This is a continuous journey of human forces .
My distance to age was 31 miles back , 10 miles away .
And I got all of the food that I needed , and I had the equipment , the robot , <unk> , with a series of <unk> -- these are the <unk> of me in three months .
And at the end of the 16 minutes , what we 're going to do is try to answer three questions . One : Why ?
Number two : How do you get a toilet in 40 or less .

I 'm not going to answer this question now , and I 'll tell you about it .
Number three : How do you do that ? What 's next ?
This is in August .
The first time I was traveling was someone with a <unk> <unk> .
At the time , I was like a apprentice .
We wanted to come from here -- the <unk> of the North Pacific .
And the Arctic , <unk> , and I 'm fascinated by what it is to be the middle of the United States .
It 's kind of like a map of the map , and you have to really figure out that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> ice cap , the ice is floating in the deep ice , and there 's a floating ice .
I asked a lot of experts .
They read a lot of books , research and graphs .
But in the morning morning I had a feeling of what I 'd like to do .
I was 23 years old , and I did n't have challenges that challenge , but almost everything was wrong .
We 've got a polar bear next day .
My cousin sank <unk> .
Our food is <unk> . We 're hungry .
And it was very scary at the time .
We certainly have the lowest communication tool .
<unk> satellite , so we had only <unk> radio .
You can see two <unk> coming from the tent .
There was a little <unk> on the door .
That 's the antenna that we 're flying on .
In two months , we have less than two hours across the world .
And the most important thing is , we 're not going to use it .
We 've got 400 miles per gallon in the Arctic , and we do n't have time .
And in summer , ice starts to melt , and we <unk> from the <unk> driver , they say , " Look , you 're not going to do it .
We have to <unk> you . "
I felt like I failed .
I 'm a loser .
And so I was a goal , and I did n't have a dream , I could n't forget it .
And in that journey , every time you go to the beginning , I 'm going to show you two shots , the two shots , to motivate me .
And the first is that success goes up to the Arctic .
I was able to imagine that I would go out of the helicopter , the rock , in the background , I did n't wake up on the <unk> , and I had to ski .
And I can even see myself in the Arctic , and you know , that 's a glorious moment , with the background , but it 's going to be <unk> .
And the second photo is I suppose I 'm going to go down to the <unk> airport , and it 's the same thing that 's <unk> , the camera 's touch , <unk> and <unk> fans , they 're starting to get rid of the literature , start looking at my literature . They 're going to go through my <unk> literature to try and get it out of my own literature and try to figure out what I 'm trying to tell you about my book , <unk> and <unk> to me , from the <unk> <unk> .
And of course , these are n't happening .
We 're going to be the North Pole , and we do n't have the money to get people to join people , and nobody knows the recession .
When I went back to <unk> , my grandfather , I won , and they were all in the U.K. -- and I was holding the British flag , a little bit .
I had a huge amount of trauma , and my soul was a loser .
But for example , I was lying on the couch on my mom 's couch , looking at the <unk> TV .
And <unk> <unk> a text from " The <unk> " , " " You 're trying to lose , but it 's failed .
So the answer is , " Start a beginning . "
Three years of <unk> <unk> , I eventually came out of the couch , and then I started to explore another expedition , which I 'm going to land on the top , directly across the surface , to the outside , in the middle .
Nobody 's ever done it in the <unk> .
The two <unk> had been done in 2000 , but nobody could travel in .
And Yves <unk> , who has completed Italy , made the attempt to make effort in 1995 , after a week after <unk> .
And he describes this journey than 10 times higher than the seasons .
So , this is probably why I do n't know why , but I know it 's not easy to go home , and there 's no easy way to move to the East , to Canada , I have to be very radical .
This means that I have to start with the <unk> of <unk> , and I can start trying to understand that one of the most <unk> <unk> in the world , in a world where you have a whole new , chaotic state -- 6,000 <unk> day .
And last year , the journey started .
We have a big support team : a camera crew , and my girlfriend , she 's a photographer .
The beginning is very good . We 're flying up to <unk> .
Next - <unk> is one of the founders of <unk> in <unk> , where the Indian population is <unk> .
And then , we rented a piece of dust conditioning , flying into a town called <unk> , which should be the last one .
And our photographer , in the best conditions , had a lot of people who were running out of the plane to ask the pilot , and we had to fly how long it was to land , which was six hours a day -- if we were alive .
So we came up with this .
<unk> joke , <unk> is n't the end of the world , but you can see that the final end .
And we just had to stay in a night for 10 days .
That 's why the cost of <unk> <unk> is in the helicopter , so we 've got <unk> .
At the end of the day , we 're dealing with all the questions that we 've all done . We 're going to take things out of these two <unk> , and two <unk> to <unk> me down .
We 've taken a nice 45 minutes clip , and the camera is still there -- and when it 's there , I 've got interviews with <unk> and all sorts of people who go to the <unk> , <unk> the plane and leave me a person .
Now I do n't know what the word is going to fall out of the real place .
And I was going to go back , and I went back to the airport , <unk> , Jude , then said , " Okay , I do n't have it . "
But even worse , you can see this <unk> , in the screen , that 's the oldest .
Because we 've got a long period of time in Russia , and of course , the biggest or the smallest <unk> of the <unk> , when you stand on the surface of a frozen ocean , it 's the most interesting thing that 's going to happen -- and it 's going to go through the surface of a warm ocean -- the <unk> will be going through , it will continue to move on the way it is , right ?
I , as you can see , are catching two <unk> .
95 percent of our food and fuel vessels are 180 <unk> -- probably 400 pounds .
When <unk> is the head or almost twice , I can <unk> two <unk> .
When I was n't the head , I had no hope .
I was just going to get one , and then I went back .
And what I 'm talking about is that these are the ones that are called the ice -- from the wind , the <unk> , the <unk> and the electromagnetic waves .
NASA is saying that ice ice is the most hostile thing that happened last year .
And ice ice is always <unk> .
And last year , I was a person practicing , and I sat down at nine weeks . Most of the time I went to the ice , and most of the time I went to move .
My record is <unk> miles .
And I went out of the morning , and I landed on the tent and it was seven hours a little half a half , <unk> the camera and realized that from where I started , I was not going to get there .
It 's really a little bit like <unk> , and I 've got the speed of ice that 's going on my head .
Today 's 22 days .
I 'm on the face , preparing it .
And the weather is very bad -- after five miles per year in the <unk> .
At the end of the study , ice is no longer problem .
Because there 's no ice -- open water .
I 'm not sure that it 's going to happen . I know that ice is warming .
And I realized that there will be open fresh water , so I 'm ready to get <unk> .
There 's some knowledge about <unk> .
polar bears have only known as well as polar bears .
If they meet water , they <unk> .
So we 've designed a <unk> <unk> -- we collaborated with the scientific community -- based on <unk> principles -- I think , <unk> pilot -- and I 'm going to fall out of a box , and then I 'll fall in the face of my <unk> gloves and <unk> my face .
That means that I can walk in very thin ice ice . If I get rid of it , it will not be appropriate .
That 's the same thing , even though the worst case is , I can skip to the water and get rid of my <unk> .
A very radical technology , radical ways -- but good .
Another exciting thing we did last year is about communication technology .
In <unk> , in <unk> B.C. -- there 's a -- one of his players , called Thomas <unk> .
And he said , " Well , in 2012 , if there 's no exploration in <unk> , there is no <unk> cell <unk> <unk> . "
All right , I 'm going to do about eight years . This is my little wireless cell phone , <unk> satellites .
It 's called a wireless telescope in my pocket .
In every single day of <unk> , I played my blog in the face of the tent , sending some <unk> videos and send the information that I walked out of -- ice -- the ice , the temperature -- and the other photos .
Remember , in 2001 , we do n't have two hours of radio communication communication .
And in the last year , I can transform the public blog instantaneously in this place called <unk> than <unk> .
And this <unk> is to enjoy high tech , in terms of what 's called functional functional .
And when the <unk> arrived , the clouds broke into the wind .
<unk> is very low . You can see here , there 's a yellow portrait in my <unk> .
And I think that the wind is moving forward .
So , the strange combinations of the high - tech and the <unk> .
On November November , I went to New York .
From Russia , I spent <unk> <unk> here , and lo and behold , it 's really clean .
.
Even in New York , not a little bit . Nothing . It 's all floating on the ocean , and it 's moving .
And in here , it 's going to be very close to the ice , and usually the way that the ice is <unk> , it 's usually the direction of Canada .
And I realized that , but I still expect some things to see .
<unk> <unk> : It 's actually <unk> , and there 's a lot of <unk> around the water , through its own forces , to the <unk> of the New York , but I start to realize that I 'm going to go back from the Arctic .
And the only evidence I had was that I was a very clear picture of this , and this little moon <unk> device .
You can see here -- there 's a nine and a half <unk> .
nine degrees centigrade -- and suddenly it goes to the Arctic .
I sat down on my legs , and I made a little chunk of <unk> in the ark .
Here 's a couple of things . I took the printer .
They 're putting batteries in the bottle .
I <unk> three numbers . I salute my mom .
Give me a letter to my girlfriend .
And the result is that I 've got three phone texts .
: 90 percent .
<unk> sensation .
The whole planet is rotating on my feet .
This world -- in my feet .
And I ended up calling my mother 's call , and she 's on the supermarket .
She started crying , she was <unk> her .
I 've crossed the <unk> for a week .
And I think it 's not going to happen in the case that we 're going to get to Canada .
This is my last day in ice .
When I work with my management team , they say , " Look , Ben , the situation gets worse .
There 's a huge amount of water in your gut .
We have to put you into the airplane .
Ben , can you find a airplane ? "
When I get this piece of paper , this is the scene of my face .
I 've never tried to go to the land of the ice , Taiwan , Tony , who said , " Ben , you have to get 500 feet per gallon , the safe ice . "
This is only a little bit of the ice that I can find -- that 's where I 've spent 36 hours per hour -- <unk> . Can I measure my <unk> .
I did n't tell Tony , and I never told the pilot .
I do n't believe it .
Narrator : Yves , <unk> , tick , wait . Yves .
It 's just a good thing , and it 's <unk> -- planes actually flew four times , so I 'm a little worried that it does n't want to land .
And the pilot , I know called <unk> , and I think it 's the guy who 's going to be a <unk> .
And I look at the airplane , and I 'm like , well , it 's a very powerful moment .
And then I thought , I 'm at least <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I should keep that <unk> projection .
And the airplane goes down to me .
<unk> open . He 's jumping down , and he says , " Hey , my name is <unk> -- " My name 's <unk> . "
.
The pilot is a woman named <unk> .
She 's sitting there on her head .
They were the ones who I met , but they made me happy .
Troy , angry grabbed the ice on ice , and we 've taken some photos . He says , " You 're going to sit down . "
He lost his arm , <unk> the airplane , and I climbed up the plane back .
And at the end of the runway , it was just a few months later , and he said , " Okay , I 'm ready to take it -- I 'll take off . " And then I realized that this was a very normal behavior , but I looked at it .
He put his hand on the plane .
You can see the engine directly in the top of the wing .
That 's the little <unk> in that place . He 's on his hand .
It 's very soft to sit in his hands .
I thought , " God , <unk> . We 've got it . "
The airplane is moving forward by the road , and it 's just hitting the door .
In the end , one of the <unk> in the crash was just a little bit better , because I could see the wing , and I can see that the skin , the leopard <unk> , he had a hand - on - shoulder , <unk> on the road , but he was able to see a penguin that was <unk> by the head , which is a hint of a <unk> .
From the atmosphere I finally saw the whole event .
And of course , when you look at ice , you just saw a obstacles . Not a pressure , a little water .
This may be why distances do n't give me how much it is .
I mean , ice is really <unk> .
Why ? I 'm not a traditional explorers .
I 'm not going to figure out what 's going on , and everyone knows the Arctic .
There 's a big <unk> in Antarctica , there 's a flying road .
There 's a restaurant and a Jupiter jacket .
For me , this campaign is exploring human limits . Nature limits the limits of the human limit , the limit of technology and technology , and these are the things that make me interested in .
And at the same time , it 's also about testing personal challenges .
For me , this is a chance of exploring limits -- to bring my potential to control the quality , how long it is .
And in a wider scale , what I 'm fascinated with is how people use their potential to live , 90 percent of the way they 're making their own potential , 70 percent reduction in their ability to use it , to seven percent , and so I hope that it 's a little bit more important to try to motivate the other people who want to do something about what 's going on in this planet .
That 's the best thing I can do .
The next question is , how do you get more convenience ?
And the answer is , of course , the last question -- what 's going on here ? What do I want to do ?
Next : Antarctica .
The most cold , the maximum , <unk> , densest continent .
At the end of the night , there was an <unk> early early in the early ' 90s , which was the first one who came to Antarctica , which was the South Antarctic Antarctic continent .
If you get out of the coast , you can see it in winter -- there 's a big -- high - speed diameter underneath the French River , right ?
Antarctica , if it 's in winter , there 's twice the size of Australia -- a big place .
Who was a Palestinian concert in the Antarctic , and <unk> was <unk> by Scott , <unk> -- he had a <unk> and a painter -- Scott <unk> .
Scott has <unk> , and some of the dog 's equations , Scott <unk> 's problem , made the question that Scott and his <unk> were able to determine the end .
And they came up with a <unk> in the <unk> of 2007 , and they found that there was a side of Norway drilling there .
There was a tent , a letter to Norway .
They turn off , and they go back to the coast , and five people died .
<unk> , nobody tried to try to go through a minute -- that 's the end of the ' 93 years ago -- from the beginning -- no , no one gets to the coast of Antarctica and return back to New York .
Every piece of land you 've heard about when you go back from New York , not using planes , car seats , <unk> , or kite up -- no , nobody 's trying to figure out the return seat , so that 's my plan .
We 'll have two people together .
And I said that .
And before I came up , I 'd like to say -- I have a -- and I wanted to scan it down -- that I had a lesson in school . And I was 13 years old , and it was in the table . Now , the <unk> report was on my table , but it said , " Ben <unk> is not enough to make anything meaningful in my desk . "
And I think that if I have to learn from school , that 's no other person can become your potential .
It 's only how you can decide how far you 're going to get it .
And they 're <unk> , and this is my story . Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk>
From short to talk , <unk> <unk> explains two stories of scientific observation : how to harness knowledge and biases , whether it 's clinically hostile , when we think about <unk> , he reminds us to ponder the limits of our brains and conservatives .
cognitive sciences , economics , medical research , science , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : <unk> with <unk>
I was a long time for a long time .
A few years later , I was devastated by the <unk> of the United States , and I said , " <unk> , <unk> -- I 'm going to have a new cure for you . "
I was playing with fun when he went into his offices .
And when I did the same thing , he explained to me that I was on the left side of the side , and my face was in the right side and I had a terrible stomach , so there was no <unk> symmetry .
Where is his genius ?
And he decided to have some <unk> on my face on the right to make me look a symmetry .
And it 's fun to hear a little bit about it , and he 's going to get a beard .
Tell me that this is a strange way of thinking , because I 've figured it out , and I think it 's going to be the way that my <unk> will be <unk> into <unk> -- because I have to make sure that the next summer .
When I arrived , I was n't quite sure .
I said , " Can you give me a sample ? "
And he showed me a picture of some of my faces -- why not very glamorous .
I said , " I 've got my old hair . What do I do ? "
" So what would that happen ? "
" Oh no worry . "
" <unk> used to make it white . "
But I was a little bit worried about that , " You know what ? I do n't want to do it . "
And then this became the largest <unk> of my life .
It 's a profound deal to make a difference .
He said , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
Would you like that kind of symmetry ?
Are you a passionate commitment ?
There 's a woman who feels so poor that you 're poor at the same time ?
All that did n't happen .
And so this allows me to be surprised because I 've got a lot of treatments -- and there are many things that I decided not to accept -- I never had sex .
But I decided not to accept this .
And I found him , " What 's going on ? "
And this <unk> comes from .
And he explains that they have been treated in the second two patients , and they need the third patient to fulfill their reports .
Now you might think that person is a <unk> .
That 's what he is .
But I want to give you a different story .
I had a series of experiments in the lab for a few years ago .
When we do experiments , we often hope it will draw different and remote control .
So we have a very high expectations about the effects of control in the face of the controls , and when we get the result , I 'm very happy -- except for one person .
There 's a group of people who are going to be really good , but actually it 's really bad .
And the average <unk> of the career destroyed me in my trial .
I look at this guy .
It 's almost 20 years old than the panda bear .
And I remember that <unk> <unk> came into the lab and thought about a simple amount of money .
" No ! " I said , " <unk> him down .
Who agreed to get this soul from the experiment ? "
But a few days later , I talked to my students about this , and we said , " Well , what if it does n't happen ?
What happens if he went to the other ?
So if we throw him out ? "
We ca n't even see that data , and if we see this data here , we might say , " Well , how do you do that , so that 's how smart people will draw , because he 's going to make a difference .
So we decided not to put her out of the way .
But these stories have a lot of other things that we 've done in front of me , and there are two aspects of my work in front of me .
First of all , we 're going to meet a lot of people in all sorts of ways that there are all sorts of ways to do it .
They stimulated themselves to a lot of <unk> .
And I 'm sure some things we 've all seen about it .
Maybe we ca n't identify , but we know it happened .
And of course , the most difficult thing is to go to the <unk> , sometimes sometimes we 're being rejected by ourselves .
This is a very , very tough curriculum .
Because we ca n't see the <unk> .
When I did experiments , I thought I was doing something for science .
And I 'm dealing with data on the data that 's really the actual data model .
I do n't do bad .
I think I 'm a <unk> trying to help science .
But that 's not true .
I actually have a lot of positive consciousness .
I think the real challenge is to try to get rid of the place where we live in our lives , trying to figure out what 's going to happen to the challenge , and try and avoid doing something that is n't <unk> , because we can do it in some non - <unk> environments .
I want to leave you with a positive idea .
I mean , this is really depressing -- people have <unk> , and people do n't see <unk> .
And these positive ideas , I think , is a kind of thing , if we know what we 're wrong with , we can actually be able to really seize these things in the place .
And that 's what I want to do . Thank you very much .
<unk>
Imagine you 've got <unk> nuts on the ground , and you have three options to save yourself and <unk> -- but it 's possible to have scary consequences , but how you 're going to do something about the possibility of fear and how to make us think about what 's going on in the future , to tell us how the possibilities of our future can transform us .

<unk> Ashanti : What we can learn from fear
One day in <unk> , 3,000 miles across the coast of Antarctica , there 's one of the most remote water water on the Pacific , 20 American <unk> looking at their ship .
They <unk> with a leopard , and they hit the boat .
And when you 're on the top of the sphere , they 're in three <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
These people are over 10,000 miles from the nearest land .
In their <unk> , they 've got the <unk> device and the water that goes down and down .
They are people who are <unk> , and their stories become part of " <unk> <unk> . "
Even in the world today , it 's much worse than this , even more bad than that .
There 's no consensus about what the problem is .
Nobody remembers them .
Most of us have never experienced these terrible faces , but we all know what fear is .
We know what fear is , but I ca n't wait for a lot of time thinking about what our fears mean .
When we grew up , we would always be encouraged to think of fears as optimism , like <unk> or <unk> .
And I think it 's not exactly what we think .
The nervous scientists already know that humans are born <unk> .
That might be why we think sometimes fear is a dangerous or dangerous danger .
" Do n't stop . " We 're always talking about other people to others . "
In English , fear is what we need to <unk> .
It 's something we have to deal with , we need to overcome things .
But what if we look at the fear of fear ?
If we look at the fear of fear , what is the same thing that we 're telling you , and how do you see things like ours ?
At the same time , we 're most easy to see the relationship between fear and imagining that they are <unk> .
I lived in California , and you all know , it 's a place where the <unk> live , but a child is a bit scary .
And I remember that when I saw a little bit of the ice that we saw in front of us , I would always be at night , and I was worried about the big earthquake when we went to sleep .
We 're saying that kids feel this fear because they have their own vision .
But in one occasion , most of us learned to get rid of this idea .
We all know that <unk> did n't exist , not every earthquake .
But the most surprising people we have n't seen , because the adults are not abandon this fear , and it 's probably not a coincidence .
And equally fascinating imagination creates " species of species " and " <unk> <unk> " , " which is the profound fear of the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And the question is , how do we learn about fear from these <unk> and young kids ?
Let 's go back to <unk> , and let 's return to the <unk> of the <unk> .
Well , let 's look at the fear of what they 're looking at in the middle of the Pacific Gyre .
She had 24 hours later after the ship .
And people did a plan , but they did n't have a lot of choices .
In <unk> <unk> , he describes the beauty article , and he wrote , " These are some of the things that are n't going to happen to the Earth , except it does n't have any <unk> . "
These people know that they 're about 30,000 miles across the nearest island .
But they heard that they were cruel .
They heard about these <unk> , and in some of the islands .
So they 're all killed by being killed as an image of <unk> .
The other way that the alternative is the Hawaii , but <unk> worry about them .
So the final option is to come up with the most important , <unk> place : 64 miles across the ice , hoping that the wind will end up in the coast of Antarctica .
But they know that when the <unk> is going to hit them , they 're going to eat food and water .
It was taken out of the storm , and she went to death before the storm .
This is the fear of the poor people , and it turns out that they choose to take care of their <unk> .
Maybe we can do it easily with other names .
We do n't call it fear , but what do they call stories ?
If you think about it , it 's fear real .
This is an ability to be , a skill of visual tales .
<unk> and storytelling have the same .
They have the same structure .
Like all stories , the role of fear .
In fear , role is us .
Now , fear is <unk> . They 've got the middle , there 's the end .
You go to the airplane . Your airplane is flying . It 's <unk> .
Our fears include all sorts of <unk> , unseen , whatever you see .
Imagine <unk> , human teeth , <unk> in the human skin .
There are also romantic fears .
If I do n't say anything like a storyteller , you might probably want to know what <unk> is , what people do .
Our fears are <unk> in Italy .
As a nice story , our fears are like a good cartoonist , to focus on our attention : what happens ?
In change , our fears make us think about future .
Also , people are only the only ones who have the ability to think about the future , which is to predict the <unk> of the future , and then our situation is going to travel in the other place .
I am a writer , and I 'm going to tell you a very important part of the novel , which is to learn a thing about how to influence the story , and that 's the same thing .
<unk> , like a novel , is always another thing .
I wrote my first novel , " <unk> <unk> , I spent months to imagine if the Earth rotates , and what happens when the Earth hits .
How do we do this day ? How do we steer our bodies ?
What 's the change ?
And that 's where I realized that I was going to ask you about what 's going on in the past , and the kids are scared of the night .
If you 're in the past , if this happens , I 'm worried about it tonight , what 's my house ? How do you feel it ?
The answer to this is usually the same .
So we think our fears are not just the fear or the story , and we should be <unk> ourselves as a storyteller .
But what 's important is that we need to imagine ourselves as a solution to our fears , and how we choose how to interpret this fear of fear .
Now , some of us are more comfortable with other people 's minds .
And I 've seen a research research study of success , author found that these people have a habit called " <unk> , " which means that people , do n't reject their fears , but to study fear , to <unk> fear and to action .
And so , if the worst thing happened , their businesses are not .
Of course , a lot of the worst things happened .
This is the remarkable side of fear .
<unk> , our fears predict future .
But we do n't think of all the fears of the fear of our imagination .
So how do you <unk> the fear of fear and fear ?
And I want to give you the story of the <unk> story , and I 'm going to give you an initiative , and it 's also very scary .
And in <unk> , they ended up making decisions .
Because they 're afraid of fear , they decided to give up the nearest <unk> , but even more difficult South America .
In the ocean , there 's two <unk> of food , like <unk> consumption , and they 're still near land .
When the last final vote ended up , there 's only a lot of people who are alive when they 're alive , and in fact , in fact , some of them become a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> brings this story as " <unk> of <unk> , " in a few years , a horrible ending in the boat , may be <unk> by people 's effort , and if they get rid of it , they 're going to leave the <unk> .
" But , <unk> said , " They 're afraid .
The question is , why are these people who are more conservative than the threat of the <unk> fear ?
Why should they be affected by a story ?
From other ways , this is a story about explaining .
<unk> <unk> says that the best readers can connect two different sorts of characters , a art of art , one of the art .
Good readers have artists who are willing to join the story , but the same thing is that they have scientists in the world , and it helps them to be <unk> and analyze the flows of the story .
And we can see that the people in the art have no problem .
They dreams a range of <unk> .
The problem is they take a mistake .
All of them fear they 're only against the most <unk> , the best stories they want : <unk> .
Maybe if they could make a little bit of a fuss about a bit like scientists , if you could hear it really sad , the story of death is probably the <unk> of <unk> , and they 're going to have a <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
Maybe if we 're trying to explain our fears , we can have less <unk> .
We 're going to take a little bit of fear of the threats to a series of <unk> or airplanes , but more interested in the disaster : <unk> <unk> , the progress of climate change .
And as most of the best stories in literary literature are usually the richest stories , we 're the most <unk> fear of fear .
In the right way , our fears are our imagination , and our ideal love is our gift , to get us into the future .
And if you can get the right interpretation , our fears are <unk> with our favorite literature : a little bit of wisdom , little <unk> and <unk> , the truth .
Thank you .
<unk>
<unk> logic , wisdom , relationships associated with the health rate of health , <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> of the political system , where the risk of <unk> is going to spread in the streets of a war , and her risk for the high - wing <unk> -- and that 's the way that we 've seen a lot of people who do n't want to stop the spread of AIDS .
AIDS , global issues , health , marketing , productivity

Yves <unk> : sex , medicine , HIV , AIDS
" People do it .
So AIDS grew up . "
This is the headline of a British newspaper , a long time ago .
I 'm curious , and you want to take your hand , who agree ?
Oh , two <unk> .
This is actually actually a <unk> <unk> that she studied about 15 years of AIDS , where you 're looking at her .
And I want to tell you about half a minute .
Some people are actually doing a lot of <unk> infections , but most people do n't have the reason to do that , and most of them are completely overwhelmed .

Excellent .
But , for example , people who study HIV , but I 'm sure all of you know that AIDS and poverty are non - <unk> , and if you 've been involved in TED , it knows the price of HIV / AIDS .
In fact , AIDS and sexual sex is <unk> , and if there are two things around the world , it 's <unk> and Arduino .
So , let 's say , " What do n't you do ? "
I used to meet with a friend of Indonesia , <unk> , conversation .
And we were eating lunch with me , and he told me that he had the experience of <unk> in his <unk> .
This is a guy who 's a birthday , and they <unk> a little bit of a <unk> to the prison -- and he tends to raise the brothers in the room .
And everybody <unk> , all of the pills , and the person who 's going to be ready to get to tribal stores , <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And then he sends the first brother off , and she <unk> on the shirt to <unk> the next .
And <unk> said , " I 'm a <unk> , and I see <unk> from me , running around me and all over the floor .
It 's more than that .
I was thinking , " It 's so disgusting that you 're dead too dangerous , but I 'm more concerned about it , and it 's a little bit more <unk> .
And <unk> gave me a little bit . The story goes back after the story , and he said , " You know , God , <unk> will make you <unk> . "
And you know , he 's a bit of a problem .
But <unk> was a drug , and he was stuck in prison .
And so he can only get the choice or the <unk> , or not .
If you have something where you do n't want to go , that 's the prison .
But now I 'm a scientist , and I wo n't use the story , so I 'll look at data .
We interview 600 <unk> of <unk> in Indonesia , and we asked them , " You know how you get HIV ? "
" Oh , I know . Open a <unk> . "
I mean , 100 percent , right , all of you are makers .
And we said , " Well , where can you get to the clean <unk> ? "
People say , " Oh , know . "
" We <unk> , we know where to get clean <unk> . "
" That 's you with <unk> ? "
Those are places that we interviewed in the streets , and the pills brought together .
" Are you carrying toes ? "
A quarter of the most <unk> ones .
So in the last week , it 's only about 10 percent of the population that 's going to be clean at the same time .
You see , it 's all about the people who know that people are going to kill HIV , but they still use a <unk> .
Why ? Is it a priority for you ?
And we asked them , and they said , " Are you crazy ?
And of course , you do n't want to share a toothbrush like you never ever before , even if it 's your lover .
That 's because , you know , why .
No , no . We do n't want to go into the prison because we do n't want to go into prison . "
Now , if you 're being rejected in Indonesia , it 's going to be <unk> by police .
It 's a different story , right ?
Because that 's what you 're choosing , or it 's going to be in the next 10 years , and now you can die for a 10-year - old <unk> and then I can use my own <unk> tomorrow .
Now , despite the risk of <unk> in the <unk> infections , it 's not a good thing to do , but in prison for a year , you 're probably going to tell you a little bit about it in jail .
And so suddenly , all of a sudden peer - to - peer is really awful .
And now we look at this idea of policy .
In fact , very simple .
And then there was one last time you did it .
We 've got rational answers from health care .
We want to use clean noise to clean clean <unk> .
So we can get rid of the <unk> and get them out of <unk> , and they do n't need to worry about it .
And the first time that came to the beginning and the people in the country , people were <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
She <unk> across the globe national national programs , <unk> , Australia , Netherlands , the Netherlands and a small other country .
In these countries , you can see that less than four percent of the people who have been infected by the <unk> .
And if you look at the state of this policy , like New York , the Grand Canyon , <unk> , in the Arctic , has an infection that has this fatal disease .
And the <unk> Foundation did this not because she had her heart .
She did this for a country where she had free markets .
So , if she did n't invest in health care , she had to pay expensive money for disease , and the cost of expensive costly is expensive .
So she made a very clever decision .
Now , if I take the glasses of my health care glasses , look at these data , and see this data .
But in this country , governments obviously do n't think they have to provide free health for free , and we 've taken a lot of accomplishments .
In the United States , what we 've been doing is testing data , constantly measuring .
So there 's hundreds of studies of data in a large amount of <unk> -- the <unk> of Science in the United States , and a lot of research shows that <unk> projects are effective .
And look , these represent research studies that you think , in this funny slide , I 'm going to show you the remote control of the limb , and the data goes up , but there 's no content on this slide .
There 's nothing else about here .
So , this is completely <unk> . You do n't think so .
Just , wait , no , the politicians are <unk> , and they do what they think they want to do .
And what we see is that <unk> are very reluctant to respond to this situation .
So it 's a very interesting thing to do with the pills .
Now talk about sex .
Are we more optimistic ?
Well , I do n't have to comment on the <unk> of <unk> who are completely <unk> . Suppose you 're going to get rid of it , they 're going to go out .
I do n't know if <unk> <unk> 's speaking TED 's talk , but the god , you can see , I have a word for you . I 've got the opportunity to do it .
It 's not easy to find .
Then , maybe your luck is okay .
OK , it 's not really easy to say , AIDS is n't easy through sex .
Is it bacteria that vary depending on your blood pressure and density .
And when somebody 's HIV - infected , it 's very , very high , and then your body starts building antibodies , after 10 years or 12 years , in a long period of time , you 've got a lot of <unk> , if you have a relationship with other people .
But in fact , before you start becoming HIV / AIDS , it does n't happen , and here , you 're going to look bad , feel bad .
So , through the <unk> of the violence , it 's a very short time in your body where you have a lot of partners in your body .
People are going to shoot away because it means you have to talk about some people in a short period of time than other people , so that it 's <unk> .
I 've been curious about it because I think <unk> is a bad thing , but it 's a good thing to do .
The truth is that 20 years of research is to tell us that there are many more people who are much more sensitive to <unk> .
And these guys , all of these people , have a lot of partners .
The number of partners in the party has twice twice as much as the <unk> .
There are some <unk> women from the countries who have <unk> traditional women , most of those countries that are in southern Asia .
These are <unk> diseases in the current scale .
And you 're looking at this data from Africa .
This is one of the seven percent of all the world 's population that goes to HIV .
And in other countries , the vast majority of the people in the world are very , very dense , but the rates of HIV / AIDS are extremely high , as a result of <unk> drugs , bankers , cars , <unk> .
Notice the data in San Francisco . There are 25 percent of <unk> infections .
Of course , if you do n't have an epidemic of HIV / AIDS .
You 've got a lot of sex with the sex sex <unk> in the Grand Canyon .
In most places in the world , some of the <unk> estimates , but not so much , in fact , we 're doing a good job .
Because it 's because of these <unk> <unk> .
This is an act of urgency to the health of the community , because it 's caused by the <unk> of <unk> .
Nobody wants that .
And no customer wants to go home .
So ultimately , you can achieve high pressure in the <unk> industry .
But in " <unk> relationship , " because maybe your wife or boyfriend , or whatever , you want to develop a <unk> or a mate , because some of the romantic standards and the <unk> , it does n't matter much better than your <unk> .
So , in that situation , you have to have powerful desire to use <unk> .
As a gentleman , he 's called <unk> .
From Haiti , we have AIDS .
Now he does n't have any sex , but he reminds you other people , why you want to use <unk> .
This is also in Haiti , reminding you why you want to <unk> .
Okay , so that 's funny , this is still the <unk> <unk> , and there 's six months later .
That 's why we call the <unk> effect .
But then the equations are n't going to fight at the bottom of the <unk> , where the decisions are <unk> .
We heard some people say , " That 's fine because , in fact , it 's really hard to treat your body , so that you ca n't get HIV . "
Well , if you look at the infection of a infection , when you 're in a disease , it 's going to go down .
But how do you do that ? If you did n't get treated ?
And so you 'll die , you 're going to kill your body as a zero .
These are green parts of the green , because you 're not going to see doctors or you do n't have a drug or a <unk> , or your body 's first three days -- or whatever it is , it 's not because of <unk> .
I mean , well , that 's good .
Do n't we go to patients ?
No , no , of course .
We have to do something more about <unk> <unk> .
But I 'm going to ask you about a question that , as many more healing people say , what do you do ?
The truth is obviously , in the developed world , the health of AIDS has been <unk> about 15 years , and we can learn a lot of lessons in those countries .
We 've seen that actually , in fact , <unk> is very , very high , extremely high - <unk> , and it 's also very interesting for AIDS , which is almost a little bit of help in health care , where the <unk> of the health are the ones who do n't have access to the treatment , but there 's a idea that , you know , if he 's infected , he is <unk> .
And the other reason is that people are not afraid of fear AIDS ; it 's also about AIDS , it 's also true .
AIDS does n't look like a <unk> like <unk> , where you 're HIV / AIDS , and you ca n't see it every day .
It 's really boring , and it 's a boring thing to do with <unk> every time you 're willing to use <unk> , or whatever you do n't drink , whatever .
And look at the data , we 'll see the answer .
These are the streams of data .
And you 're looking at the <unk> of the drug , and it 's all over the course of the country .
Then you get down .
It does n't matter whether it 's a railway station , most of the sponsors or the pills , and in the beginning , there 's no situation where there are no conditions for what I told you about earlier .
But in <unk> , there 's a huge rise in the population of <unk> <unk> .
These are the <unk> of <unk> .
What does that mean ?
That means that one person is not afraid of <unk> , and the other side of the virus is increasing , the number of people who live longer , more health , it 's more <unk> to HIV / AIDS .
What does that mean ?
And that means that the more health of the health is , the more we need to <unk> harm .
How do you do that ?
No , I call it compassion .
And two days later , we 're all talking about compassion , which is that people are very difficult to do high - risk quality and overconsumption , and it 's hard to give <unk> <unk> .
But when they stopped <unk> or bankers , they become HIV - AIDS , and we 're going to reject everything that 's expensive to buy expensive drugs until they live in their life .
It 's completely unsatisfactory from health care .
I want to say <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is for <unk> , and she 's in the streets of <unk> . She 's got <unk> girls .
Why ?
And of course , since she was forced to get rid of it , etc , etc .
But if we teach her to make a good job in her factory , it does n't work .
In Indonesia , the average factory is earning 20 hours per hour .
It 's a little different from each other .
This slide from this slide comes from me talking to about 35 percent of the workforce , and this is all about every hour of customers .
This job is bad , but it 's really smart for people .
Okay , Steve .
We have ways , knowledge , money , determination and determination , <unk> AIDS .
<unk> : Why are the boys of HIV ?
cause politics .
When political intervene , everything becomes <unk> .
<unk> : " When political intervene becomes upset . "
From the Zen of customers , politicians are completely unrelated .
From the perspective of the health care perspective , medication in <unk> .
Everyone has a kind of logical logic .
How many of the people in the world have a kind of logic . This is a human race .
But all of the different logic and non - <unk> are n't glamorous , so <unk> enabled <unk> , because a stupid solution for the politicians to make stupid decisions , and that politicians do n't want to behave because they think they can behave .
But the problem is we 're <unk> .
Now , of course , these people , but TED is an idea of a <unk> <unk> .
Everybody in this room , every single person in the site , has a responsibility to ask politicians in science and to <unk> policy .
We 're not very interested in creating the world 's world - to - peer tendencies , but you can actually use it at least as well as possible to stop the politicians who do n't want to be able to <unk> the spread of <unk> to HIV .
Thank you .

Yves <unk> : The history of the Arab world
Over the decade , I was in Afghanistan .
I was talking about the war in Afghanistan as a journalist , and I saw this kind of war when it came to the face of many scary and harm .
And then , two years later , I wrote another war -- Iraq .
I was struck by the war of war because I had reports from the north of Iraq .
The war ended up <unk> a regime of civil war to Afghanistan .
And that <unk> regime of the regime is actually a <unk> , a liberal , decades , which makes the entire country in the world .
And yet , the change that the economy has led to the people who do worse and make people feel a little bit more disturbing .
In the last decades , we live under the <unk> of <unk> -- in the Arab world , in the Middle East .
And this particular period of affairs is the same thing that we create .
I 'm 43 years old .
In the last 40 years , what I 've seen is that our <unk> and our dad are almost the same face -- <unk> , addiction , corruption -- these are the regime .
I 've been intrigued by this moment , whether we 've seen this change in the lifetime of the experience , which is not going to depend on poverty , not to get rid of <unk> , and that 's not the invasion of our land .
And the <unk> said , yes , they 've lost Saddam Hussein , Carter , but when they see their land they 're going to get rid of the poverty they feel very , very sad .
And they started to start in <unk> .
And they do n't want to accept that .
In fact , the other regime told them , " Do you want to meet the status of Iraq ?
Would you like to see the political and oppressed ?
You want to see harm ?
Would you like to see the military military ? "
And those people are <unk> , " Maybe we should continue to live in the face of the existing regime . "
That 's one of our most scary nightmare .
In the decade , unfortunately , we 've been talking about the images of the image of <unk> conflict , which is a <unk> of violence in the land , and there are thousands of civilizations that are going to happen .
And I want to tell you about the future that we dreamed of .
The new generation of education has been inspired by the common values of values and have the vision of the ecology of globalization , and this generation has already made a new reality .
We 've found a new way to express our emotions and our dreams , the young people in our country in the Arab world , and they give us the freedom to make our new meaning to the streets .
No violence does n't happen .
As long as you get out of your mailbox , your voice <unk> : " We want this regime . "
This is happening in <unk> .
And a few days ago , it 's been funded by the <unk> of safety , <unk> , trying to sustain the state of the country and try to maintain the prison for the rest of our country .
People are forced to get out of the streets , and they 're not going to make it wrong .
<unk> wants to kill these people .
They found something called Facebook .
Finding something called " <unk> . "
They 're crazy .
They said , " These kids are <unk> . "
So they brought their parents to the streets , and they brought them back to the streets .
And this is what they say about , that 's their <unk> .
" Take these kids home because they 're <unk> . "
And yet , those sorts of values that are inspired by the <unk> of the future , and those who are very excited about the best people in the world , but the young people who do n't work in this term and respond to the truth .
They have their parents to support them in the streets .
This is based on <unk> change .
We 're <unk> Al Jazeera in <unk> years , and we 're not allowed to do anything about <unk> , Al Gore .
But what we found was people in the streets , the people on the street , and the reporters were able to zoom in a picture of our <unk> and film and news .
And all of a sudden , in <unk> , <unk> became a center to collect all sorts of information from common -- they 've managed to engage together , and they have <unk> from <unk> .
So we decided , we 're going to have the news .
We need to become the defender of these people .
We 're going to disseminate it .
Yeah , some of these young people in the world are connected by each other , but the relationship between the Arab world is very limited , and it 's very , very tiny because we have a lot of problems .
<unk> : Al Gore 's voice to <unk>
We let this sound spread in the Arab world , and every family in our English channel , the world - opening community , spread around the globe .
And then people start to feel a new <unk> .
And then <unk> <unk> decided to leave the <unk> .
And then , in the end , the <unk> of Egypt had decided to leave it .
Now , this is <unk> .
Next is Yemen .
You 'll see a lot of other countries who want to see and experience it , " How do we imagine a great , peace , future future ? "
And I want to tell you about the Internet and the relationship between people and people who have created a kind of an <unk> .
But this kind of thinking is still a lot of land , and it 's filled with its land , and it 's all very glamorous .
This is a lot of different things before I think about changing the action , and we think that governments are telling us -- and that 's true -- that is , when it 's changed , we 're going to create <unk> , because they think this is not their culture .
We 've always believed that change is going to depend on the inside of the interior , and it needs to connect with the cultural diversity of our traditional traditions and our faith in the world , the same values of <unk> , which is deeply <unk> .
Now this is happening in the moment of the Arab world .
This is the right moment , which is great moments , and we 've seen these important things that connect to each other and create a very new era .
How do you respond to what it is -- what 's called " political <unk> ? "
For Facebook they sent out the <unk> to Tahir Square .
For aliens , Al Gore started to <unk> .
When they failed , they claim that somebody was building <unk> in Tel Aviv .
They started <unk> the West , " careful <unk> . "
Yves organizing our land .
These are people who claim to create new <unk> .
They 're waiting for those people who are preparing you <unk> your great civilization . "
<unk> people are n't doing that right now .
Because in this area , the <unk> of this region has disappeared .
They 're not going to be able to see what they 're doing .
They 're missing .
They 're living people who are living , and now we see one of them and then another <unk> <unk> .
<unk> Al Gore 's tools
We ca n't create change .
And when this is happening , we become the center of the <unk> report .
We had <unk> journalists in Egypt , and we had arrested .
But most of our <unk> , our reporters are <unk> into the Egyptians -- completely completely <unk> to the Russians .
18 days ago , our camera is always converging to the percentage of the people in the <unk> .
And I remember , one day somebody had my cellphone -- a few weeks I did n't know -- from <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
He told me , " We 're not going to look at the camera .
If you turn on the camera , it 's going to happen next to us tonight .
And you 're going to write the situation where the rain rain is in protecting us . "
And I felt like I had a responsibility for the local journalist and our news to tell them , " You 're going to have to get a little bit better at night because the people in the room are more confidence because people are able to feel that they 're protected . "
So we have the opportunity to create a new future in the Arab world .
We have the opportunity to go into the new future and know what it is to the world .
We do n't need to make mistakes in Iran .
We should be willing to give the point -- especially in the West , the Western world -- one of the ways that the Arab world is spreading , and it 's based on stability and security .
The steady stability of <unk> is that the safety of the security is just <unk> terrorists , violence and <unk> .
We should accept the choices .
Do n't tell us what we love to <unk> their future .
The future should be self - deterministic , even though they get scared .
But the values of democracy , the liberties of the <unk> , is now <unk> in the Middle East , and this is the world 's best time to see things that can see stability and security and see the image of <unk> and the images that have to replace violence and <unk> .
We should support people .
We should be <unk> .
We need to give us the risk of <unk> to <unk> the people in the world for the greatest future of the <unk> .
The future is in the future .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I have a couple of questions to ask you .
Thank you .
How do you describe this important history ?
It can generate a factor of a year , a decade of influence , but also more influence ?
Anthony birthday : In fact , this might be the most big event we 've ever ever reported .
We reported a lot of war .
There 's a lot of <unk> , lots of problems , many of the problems that are going on in the area , because we 're in the center of these events .
And this event -- very great . Very beautiful .
We do n't mean it 's just because you have to write one thing .
You 're seeing historical change .
You 're the birth of a new era .
And that 's what this is about .
Chris Anderson : There are many people in the West who think that this is just a little larger anesthesia <unk> .
You really believe that if Egypt is now creating a new government now , then this government will accept the values that you 've ever asked earlier ?
<unk> : In fact , people are in the middle of the <unk> regime , the young <unk> , and they 're trying to make a difference between the people who are working on the process of changing the values of democracy , in terms of what 's going on for democracy .
In my opinion , these people have a lot of political leaders than the elite , even in political <unk> , and also in politics .
And now , these young people in the Arab world are more intelligent and intelligent , and they have the ability to change , more political , political and cultural ideology that <unk> more regime and <unk> .
Chris Anderson : That 's why we 're not proud of them .
So here 's the TED audience , and people in the West believed that this is happening , if they want to participate in it , or how do they do it ?
Anthony birthday : I think we 've found one of the leading <unk> in the Arab world -- people care about this big change .
So by <unk> <unk> , today , we 've got the director of the <unk> Al Jazeera website , and he tells me that we 're flying across the world .
Fifty percent of <unk> comes from the United States .
Because we found that people are looking at what they want to know -- they 're going through our Internet .
Unfortunately , in the U.S.
But what I can tell you is that it 's worth <unk> , and we can use all of the people who are able to express these people in the streets , to the support of their support , who can be connected to our support and to help us make a better future for us all all the time .
Chris Anderson : Okay , well , a group of <unk> in the TED community stand up with a lot of TED conference at the same time .
These are some of the speakers .
I do n't believe they hear .
Thank you for them and to inspire us .
Thank you very much .

And she always said a little bit about me , like , " Time is probably going to be able to heal wound , but it 's not a <unk> . "
She said , " <unk> your friends .
Why , because if you do n't have them , you 'll be a stranger . "
This is her song .
Let 's start with the song that 's going to get rid of this song .
<unk> by Michael <unk> .
Give him a little bit of this .
One , two , three , four .
ooh , my love is <unk> , and if I ca n't see her , I would become crazy .
And I had to live on the river , and when I was going to hit the water , I would be able to show you that she could n't meet her .
Hey , thank you , <unk> . Hey , hey , wait .
Hey , hey , <unk> . Hey .
What you see here is a picture of <unk> <unk> at <unk> , in <unk> .
And I went to that place where she learned .
She ca n't wait . She could n't play again .
I took her on the hallway .
And so on the ground , it 's her family 's head on <unk> <unk> .
And two nine .
And then we <unk> it . She 's no longer a foot , so I sing , " Hey , hey , wait . "
Hey , hey , <unk> percent of the time , you know , thank you , <unk> !
Hey , hey , <unk> . Hey .
Oh , I did with her <unk> .
She was upset , she was <unk> .
And the <unk> and the geese are swimming down in the middle of the world , and when the sound is silent , it 's a little <unk> .
Hey , hey , <unk> percent of the time , you know , guys .
Hey , hey , <unk> . Hey .
So let 's start with <unk> .
Oh , we 're going to marry , and next Saturday .
I can enjoy it . She 's going to stay alive .
We 're doing good bears , maybe someday , someday someday .
Hey hey , hey . Hey , agree , guys , thank you .
Once again .
Oh , hey , <unk> percent of the <unk> ! Hey , agree , guys .
Hey , hey , <unk> . Hey !
Thank you , Michael .
This is <unk> <unk> .
And when I arrived in Southern California , it was a school school , and I went there with biology and art , which he came to campus .
That 's what it 's about in 1968 , I think .
And he played his <unk> - style music , but at the end of the concert , he plays a style of <unk> <unk> from Africa .
<unk> can be called <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> from his mother and <unk> .
I love love .
And I asked it , how do I learn it ?
And he said , " Well , you can go back to the <unk> , and I 'm here , or I 've got a lot of music in <unk> , and there 's a lot of music .
Because there 's a lot of older people who live in the past life .
And then I went there .
I do n't have people who are born with culture .
You know , I go back to school , and I 've completed my school and my parents said , " I 'm going to go to a <unk> dancer .
You can imagine what they 're excited about .
I think I 'm going to show you some images of some of my mentors .
It 's just some of those , but maybe you get some hint from those <unk> .
It 's a <unk> . Let 's make a fuss about it .
And finally , a couple of images of <unk> <unk> last year .
He was one of the best slums of America .
<unk> tells him what he knows , it sounds like this , and you 're hard to understand what it is . But it 's really great .
And he lived in this room of his great building .
No food , no power . A very , very good man .
You can see some more images .
In fact , I have a website , a lot of photos I 've taken on this picture , and I do n't have the opportunity to get you to see the people .
This is the instrument that you see in those pictures , and it 's called <unk> .
It was absolutely the world 's first demographic , and in southern southern <unk> people still play it .
Now , <unk> is no longer <unk> , but the guitar is doing something like this .
They 're just using a database of a branches and <unk> them to <unk> them .
It 's not a good thing to do for the cat , but it 's also a nice little <unk> .
It sounds like this .
How do you know that many of the stories that make a lot of good stories about the <unk> of <unk> boys ?
<unk> <unk> , my name is <unk> ; we 're all going to have a <unk> girl .
<unk> <unk> , my name is <unk> ; we 're all going to have a <unk> girl .
Now , they 're <unk> , and there are people who know where they are .
When people see them , they get rid of the guns .
<unk> <unk> , my name is <unk> ; we 're all going to have a <unk> girl .
<unk> <unk> , my name is <unk> ; we 're all going to have a <unk> girl .
It sounds like a <unk> .
Well , that 's 1954 , I think about it .
We 're driving out of <unk> in Texas , and I 've spent my childhood there .
We went back to the city of the <unk> <unk> .
My mother was driving ; I sat with my brother 's sister .
We were all born with Mother 's mother , and we were like windows .
It 's tens of thousands of acres .
We just had to go to the <unk> , and my mother would n't be able to buy a <unk> that was nine years old .
Oh , guys , <unk> .
And the mother 's on the side of the room , she 's driving on her side , and she says , " You ! You think you want to be .
You do n't know how hard it is , and your dad works .
You think that money comes from the tree . You never have to raise your workforce .
You 're too upset , and you 've got to find a job in this summer . "
She 's going to stop in the car , and she said , " It 's all coming out . "
My brother and my sister came up .
We 're standing in a hundred million acres .
It 's about a hundred - black farmers who are doing the <unk> .
My mother broke us down to our <unk> .
She goes to her <unk> , and she said , " I 've got two orders of <unk> to feed myself . "
And of course , we 've got a eight - year - old age .
And she said , " Can you work for them ? "
Well , it 's a very funny idea for <unk> : <unk> these two groups of white kids in the <unk> <unk> , and that 's Saturday -- the weather is very hot .
So he gave us one empty sheet of glasses , about 10 feet long , and then the size of the king , then we started <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is very <unk> , but it 's on it .
If you do n't know what you 're in there , your <unk> immediately .
And I started with my brothers and my sister , and our hands started <unk> , <unk> -- " Mom ! "
And the mother is sitting next to us , like this .
She did n't intend to <unk> us .
And I think , <unk> can see him in his head .
And he went down to us to start with the sound of <unk> .
And he 's singing , " Oh , there 's a gap between the top , and I know .
Do n't go from me .
Oh , there 's a gap between the sphere , and I know .
Do n't go from me . "
And the people in this neighborhood started singing , and he said , " Good news , OK , good , <unk> , Fall off . "
" Good news , CNN begins . "
The good news , the horse comes from . "
And I do n't want to be <unk> . "
In my sister and my brother , we never heard that music . It 's beautiful .
And we 've got the Holy <unk> of the day , no complained , they did n't cry , and they said , " Oh , you do n't want to cry ; you 're not going to say " <unk> " and " hard " -- " that 's what I did . "
And finally , every single day , we have a quarter - <unk> quarter of the <unk> .
But the <unk> of farms are really good , giving us one dollar check , but my mom does n't have to make it money .
I 'm now now at the age of <unk> ; I 've got it .
Now , my mother wanted us to learn from the value of <unk> labor .
But if you have kids , it does n't work .
Yes , we went to something else .
The first lesson I learned in those days was that I did n't do that very well .
And it does n't happen .
But I 've learned that , in this world , there are some people who really need to do it every day , and it 's really really <unk> me .
At the same time , I learned that a nice song could make a difference .
And it can bring people together , and other ways to do it .
I had a little eight - year - old boy when I was my mom , and when my mother was swallowed in Texas .
I do n't even know what music is -- it does n't know .
When that day in <unk> , when people start screaming , I found my heart , and I think that 's what I started trying to pursue .
I love it with me , and I <unk> : Oh , there 's a gap between you , but I know .
<unk> : Do n't you go to me ?
Oh , there 's a gap between the sphere , and I know .
Do n't go from me .
Good news , good news : Fall off .
The good news : horses from CNN .
Okay , good news : horses from CNN .
Do n't go from me -- you do n't have the Grand Canyon , is n't it ?
Let 's do it .
Oh , there 's a gap between the sphere , and I know .
Do n't go from me .
Oh , there 's a gap between the sphere , and I know .
Do n't go from me .
Okay , good news : horses from CNN .
The good news : Fall off from the gecko .
The good news : Fall off from the gecko .
Do n't go from me .
And in this few years , I came back to thinking about this , and I talked about it .
My mother was in the audience .
And after the end -- of course , she was happy to have a story about her story , but when she ended up and said , David , some things I have to say to you .
I did this .
I 've found a <unk> . I found the owner of this continent .
I just want you to learn the values of the two kids .
I do n't know if you 're born with music .
We 've got it . Good news : CNN begins .
Good news : horses from above .
Good news : horses from above .
Do n't go from me .
Okay , this is <unk> guitars . This is the instrument of the U.S.
This is the first time that 's been created by a lot of <unk> brothers , and they built <unk> , a <unk> instrument that had a metal <unk> -- it 's from there .
It 's usually putting it on the leg .
It 's made in the last 20 years to play the <unk> of Hawaii , and they do n't have a lot of open guitars and invent it .
And the African - American <unk> , even as you can say , can be a good dancer , like this -- a nice <unk> can <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
Put the <unk> off , and start playing .
And the instrument would say <unk> me .
I was 14 years ago , and I thought , I had lost my daughter in a crash accident that was the most -- it was almost impossible to feed me -- almost almost to my life .
I think I know what happiness is because I 've got these incredible <unk> on the bottom of the corner , just wanting to <unk> .
I have to have a good reason to live .
I have to sit down and put it down , because I really want to leave it , and I 'm ready for the world .
Of course , Alexander 's first one is <unk> , and my son , my dad -- my parents -- I do n't want to harm them .
And when I think about something , those are very small things .
I do n't care -- I have a radio <unk> camera in <unk> , and I 've got a laptop show , " <unk> walking . " And I 'm not concerned about money , <unk> or other things .
Do n't care about anything . Nothing cares .
And the lists on the list , looking at Spring openness , and the new <unk> of the spring , the <unk> <unk> , which is 95 percent of these kids , <unk> the gecko 's hand , to open the Grand Canyon of <unk> -- <unk> and Lawrence <unk> .
For me , <unk> 's voice , because my parents 's neighbors gave me a guitar .
And I sat down on the King Ice Shelf , but I do n't play a sad <unk> .
That 's the only one , in all the instruments , to get me out of the <unk> .
And that song came from that .
I heard you meet the problem .
God , I hate listening to that .
If you want to tell me , you know , I 'll hear you tell you .
Do n't let you go ; I 'll tell you what I normally do .
I 'm going to work with one another , and I 'm going to show you another one .
People say , " Oh , please . "
Yeah , it 's easy to say .
When you look at it , they 're looking for <unk> .
Sometimes I think maybe it 's going to be better in my grief , " until you 're able to get rid of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> . "
Now , you can take all of you , smoking , drinking , <unk> , blood pressure , but you know that these are n't going to happen .
I have some mysteries that make things different .
And before I arrived , I was just playing with <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
I think I can tell you , my dad is a inventor .
At 1957 , it was just released when we moved to California .
And he was looking at <unk> ; he had a lot of patent .
We moved from John <unk> to the corner of the corner .
They were obsessed with me .
John formed , and Michael becomes a creator of the computer .
And Michael 's dad is doing something called " computer . "
And that 's 1957 , I 'm still a 10-year - old boy ; I do n't know what it is , and he 's going to take me through the past , you know , what they 're doing is that they are doing what you do . It 's like a library , a piece of engineers , which tells you that you can <unk> this huge <unk> .
I thought , oh God , that would be a little <unk> .
So this Christmas Christmas -- I 've got time to talk about these -- that Christmas <unk> , I found <unk> chemicals .
I want to become an inventor like my dad and Michael .
His grandfather was the founder of <unk> , the creator of the <unk> engine .
So we thought that this is a chemical <unk> <unk> .
We see three amazing chemicals : neoteny , <unk> and <unk> .
Christ , we have 10 years old , but we know the <unk> .
We 've made a little bit of <unk> , and we put it on the lawn , we paste , it 's <unk> , it 's a cool thing . It 's very cool !
And obviously , what 's going to do is to make a volunteer .
So we came up with the <unk> garage garage , and there 's all sorts of things that we put up on the underside of the tube , <unk> over the bottom , with a little hole in the middle , to the lower <unk> of our <unk> , putting it into the ceiling , put it in <unk> -- and it 's going to take a couple of coat coat <unk> on a garage .
We 're not <unk> : We put on five feet on top of it .
And we <unk> that thing , and the <unk> goes around -- <unk> <unk> to paste .
It brought out the garage .
There are two <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
We <unk> all the stuff in his yard .
That 's the touch of touch , and maybe <unk> is still there .
My brother heard about us .
And he <unk> with his partners , and they 're very <unk> .
That 's what we 're going to learn if we do n't make a fuss about them .
And we said , " Well , what do you do ? "
And they said , we 're going to throw ice into the rocket battery .
And of course , we 'll give you a whole bunch of things .
So we did a lot of them for them , and I was just moved there . We moved to California .
Mother <unk> <unk> the Kitchen ; the mother does n't go home . We found the <unk> .
Chris <unk> <unk> on <unk> plates
And I did n't stand in the kitchen .
Chris <unk> says , " Okay , look , see , it 's swimming . OK , <unk> in ice .
There is no problem . Okay . "
And it <unk> , Chris <unk> around , and he looks like this .
No hair , no eyebrows , nothing .
The mother is <unk> all over the place ; the air is open .
She goes back home , she took that chemical <unk> , and we never seen it .
And we often think about it , because every time the mother does a sushi cake , it always <unk> <unk> .
So I love to invent things , and I thought , as close as I 'm going to give you a little invention .
When I was a third , I thought , why do n't we use the oldest form of music , <unk> , and the most modern technology ?
I called it a <unk> coat .
At the time , the cards were really fresh .
I put these <unk> together , and I was 12 .
I showed you some <unk> music yesterday , and I 'm going to show you this today .
I have a switch here , and there 's also , there , here , there .
If I do n't get rid of it , it 's okay . Okay .
Now I put this bladder switch on the <unk> , and they put all kinds of sounds , they make all sorts of sound , like <unk> .
Let me put them together , and then I can change the noise on the side of the ride , but let me show you a little peek or something like that .
Thank you .
<unk>
And every seven years , designer <unk> closed his studio for a year in New York , took his inspiration for his mission . He explains a lot of value in the <unk> of his <unk> , and show him the work of <unk> in <unk> .
adventure , art , creativity , design , happiness , productivity , work
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : <unk> force
I have a design studio in New York .
And every seven years I 've closed a year , a little bit of experiments , and some of them are n't easy at the normal time .
In a year , we do n't accept any customer .
It 's totally blind .
It 's a very nice time for the time .
First of all , I was driving this studio in New York , and my two <unk> : music and design .
We make films and design , and there are many of you who are familiar with a lot of romantic musicians that you have n't heard of .
And so I realized that many of the things that I love as living as life is , when you 're <unk> .
It becomes <unk> .
And my studio is not very glamorous .
You see , the book is <unk> a glass .
And the same design , for <unk> , to <unk> a <unk> book .
So we decided to figure out a year .
I also have another reason that we 're going to learn about 40 years of life in the beginning of life , for 40 years .
It 's about 15 years of retired life .
I think more <unk> , maybe for five years to get them to work .
I obviously feel happy .
But more importantly , it 's a little bit more important from a random couple of years .
Two years ago , a TED Fellow named <unk> <unk> calls his job for three different levels of levels .
taught me full of it .
I could use work as a <unk> , something that was a <unk> .
And that 's the beginning of the weekend .
I 'm going to need a risk , balance - life .
Or I can think of work as my career , so I 'm going to do something more .
But sometimes I want to spend this amount of energy ?
And the third level is , as a kind of work , if you 're working on jobs , it 's probably possible if I do n't have any money , even if there 's no money .
I 'm not religious , but I 'm respect to nature .
My first <unk> was spent in New York .
I hope it will be different .
Europe and America are n't big enough for me , so I 've got Asia .
And the most beautiful ecosystems I see in Asia is in <unk> and <unk> .
There was still a civil war , so I picked the <unk> .
That 's a beautiful , <unk> <unk> .
And I immediately went there in September , 2008 .
And there 's a lot of <unk> .
But what I need to do is , first of all , the polar bears are too much .
And secondly , I need a way of trying to keep them around the house , and when I went down the morning , I was walking on my house .
We did this 99 dog <unk> as a series of T .
A dog is a T - shirt one .
You know , as a little <unk> , it 's the message of the <unk> of the T , the <unk> behind the T .
When I left New York , I thought I could <unk> my studio .
I 'm going to give you a job .
They do n't stop .
And <unk> sells furniture .
And the result is that I ca n't do anything .
I did n't like it .
And one of the things I did was that I was designing furniture .
In design , of course , we 're still talking about <unk> .
It did n't work .
And I remember doing this , and I said to the dog .
I also designed this .
" Come here . "
And it had <unk> <unk> .
We also have a lot of <unk> in the <unk> of the ice , and it 's filled with the magnet that does n't move all the way to the center .
And then she designed this fabulous , <unk> chair .
In <unk> , I started <unk> first .
But also , I 'm going to talk about a lot of people who are happy to hear about people .
So I do n't think so .
Many of you know this TED Prize dance <unk> , and he wrote the book from the TED conference .
When I was four years later , I ended up calling this book for the first time .
I 'm happy to know that <unk> is the book that 's on vacation .
I 'm going to tell you some people from <unk> .
This is a little bit of a <unk> in the face of the <unk> world , and his entire restaurant is in <unk> <unk> in northern <unk> .
His restaurant was seven months old .
And the other five months he was looking at his period , and the kitchen was not glamorous .
His latest data is <unk> .
His restaurant could take eight people a year .
They received <unk> million <unk> .
Look at my cycle , seven years old , and I spent a year .
Look at a company that 's much more successful than I 've ever spent the last 30 years , in the 1930s , doing what they want to do .
Some of the stuff was successful .
<unk> <unk> is the product of this company , and the <unk> of the company developed a <unk> plate , which is that he uses his personal time for <unk> .
Google , 40 percent of their software engineers do what they want to do .
Anyone in the audience trying to figure out what to do ?
Okay ?
<unk> your hands on you .
Please talk to them , look at their face .
I found that the best way to think about the future is to talk to the people who are going to work with the people who are going to be more effective .
When I think about a good idea , I put decisions in front of the day .
And I 'll tell you a lot of people , and I 'm going to wait for the rest of my day , and I 'm not going to get a little bit cooler .
I did n't have a little bit of work in my first university .
I do n't think it 's a good thing to do , so I 'm not going to advertise it . But I am wrong .
There 's no plan , I 'm going to make a little bit of stuff , and I do n't mean it 's the job of work , but I mean , it 's something else .
For instance , for Japan to design magazine .
That means , I 've been born for myself .
And so quickly I have a list of things that I 'm interested in , and <unk> them up to the larger ones and then <unk> , like in the <unk> .
What 's the project ? The Japanese is eight to nine .
That 's not very successful . So , etc . , etc .
And in fact , the beginning of the first time , these were really designed for me .
What happens .
And I went to design again .
I ca n't believe .
From the long term , my first <unk> is successful success .
And because the quality increase , we can make a higher price .
And perhaps the most important thing is that the next seven years of our design is <unk> from the year of us .
And then you look at some of the projects that are the ones that have been designed after the first time .
One of the first things that we 're looking at is what we call accurate .
It turns out that this <unk> has to do exactly exactly the same way , but it 's not the right thing to do .
The family is inviting us to design the music center for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the Portugal center .
Even though I want to design this logo , I do n't have a chance to see the building .
And one of the major reasons is that <unk> <unk> is doing a parable for <unk> in <unk> , and he says , well , he 's going to get into the layer of the layer .
And I did n't understand it , and I was close to the design of the English language to understand that , basically , design is open design .
I understood that the building itself is a logo .
It 's a very easy thing to make .
We 've got a vessel in the buildings that look at the ground , looking at some of the directions of <unk> , across the West , in Southern Asia , in the West , in the West , in the West .
And using a very special approach , a friend of mine wrote a piece of software , which is the home of the music .
You connect it to the scanner .
Take any images , like Beethoven , for example .
Software can immediately get your music immediately immediately .
When you want to design a piece of Beethoven , it 's a lot of <unk> , because the visual elements and the joy is exactly exactly the same .
So in the idea of the concept , they have other sorts of other things .
If you played music , it 's a distinctive portrait .
Or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> Reed , who 's going to show who is there , and who has your own logo here , which is the <unk> of the music themselves .
In the middle of the music , it 's also the same , as the <unk> of music -- or in the ' 80s , or their music <unk> in their own business .
There was a whole range of <unk> crossing in that building .
They have <unk> signs .
This is the truck they did .
They have a little bit of modern art , one of the <unk> <unk> , and the name is <unk> .
<unk> is that you can create advertising with this logo .
It 's like this guy 's poster or a <unk> or an Mozart , or <unk> <unk> .
You can design it according to its shape .
You can get it out of the skin .
You can design a poster , a <unk> , in the middle of the music , outside the house , and at the bottom of a day , or the <unk> of music -- or whatever it is .
And the second one : I was all going to show you a lot of the time when I went to design this language , and I was n't going to make it wrong .
I do n't have a ticket .
My parents are <unk> .
But I think I 've spent a lot of time learning about this language , why do n't I just use it ?
It can also do something else .
These work came from this idea .
Some of you might have seen it already .
I 've been showing TED at TED before the TED conference , which is " What I learned . "
I 'm going to tell you about two numbers .
This is a banana seat on a different <unk> , and it 's in a New York City <unk> .
It said , " confidence is good . "
Last week later .
Two weeks later , three , four , eight .
And you can see it 's almost entirely , almost , not all .
This is some prescription to me .
And the Amsterdam Times gave us a hotel and we do something .
We use <unk> as a kind of a background in the background as an <unk> .
We have different sorts of <unk> from the military for 25 million dollars per second .
There are the new ones who are very old and crowded .
It took a week to make this a little bit more than a couple of volunteers , which is , " <unk> <unk> . "
Our idea is that we 're going to do it very well , and it 's a really good thing to think that I 'm going to try to get rid of it .
They 're still maintaining images .
There 's a week in the process of the <unk> , and there 's been a lot of people who live around with the people around it , looking at it .
When it finally came up with a big coat of plastic , she had a huge bag of glasses in the <unk> <unk> , and until he had a neighbors , and until his neighbor was rejected .
Amsterdam in Amsterdam , <unk> , and see what they want to protect it .
And then you get rid of the police , and I put it in the police system , right .
You see them .
That 's police , and it 's all <unk> .
And after eight hours of <unk> , there 's almost a lot of <unk> than that .
We started a larger project .
It 's a movie of happiness .
In here , we asked local pigs to do the title .
They do n't look at them .
And what we 've done is , we 're trying to figure out how she 's going to work beautifully beautiful .
It seems very good .
It 's a little <unk> .
And my studio is in a monkey forest .
This monkey of monkeys looks really happy .
We asked these guys to help .
They 're great , but they do n't have a problem .
And of course , if you do n't want to do something about it , it 's totally aligned .
We 'll make this film for two years .
I have to have a few times .
You might think maybe the film is probably going to do something about happiness .
You can certainly see this guy .
I 'm glad I live alive .
I 'm glad I live alive , I 'm happy .
Thank you .

Physicist Lee <unk> talks about how to transform : as he says , " We 're going to fight and engage with the debate , but at the same time , the next generation of scientists will make a difference , which is equally ubiquitous , and he said , well , democracy is also equally developed . He says it 's equally same .
community , global issues , physics , politics , science , social change

Lee <unk> : The opposite of science and democracy
I had a three - year - old guy in London , who found me , and I said , " Some people , I mean , we want to build an exhibition in a fashion stadium .
We have <unk> dollars . We want to make it work .
We want to be in the <unk> region , and we 're going to invent it .
We 're going to get rid of the young people , but we have the <unk> of <unk> , and they 're doing the same thing .
I think 25 seconds , so this is a good idea .
Three years later , we 've got <unk> <unk> in <unk> , " This is the best job ever done .
I 've found a job for my first day , and I even even worry about it , because when I 'm here , there 's anything going on here .
And I 'm going to take you through a little bit of time in my spare talk , and I 'll show you what we 're talking about .
To give you a sense of progress , we think a lot about it .
First , whatever , if you know about science , you 've learned that you 're going to learn about the scientific method of the classroom , which is wrong .
On the other hand , we 're not talking about the answer to the question that we all agree with us .
This is what a democracy will do .
So , how do you work that way ?
And I think this method works because scientists are connected to the community .
Here 's a little bit of the idea .
I do n't read it , I 'm not teaching you .
I 'm going to show you .
But one of these ideas is : every scientist will believe that everything is right .
But we 've got consensus , which is , you know , if you have the theory of my theory , whether people are correct , 50 years later , the next generation scientist in 50 years .
So , for traditional and traditions and today , it 's going to depend on the <unk> of <unk> and science that need to be <unk> , to <unk> the development of science .
In this developed mode , in the area of the development of sharing , I believe that the process is that it teaches us that this process tells us about democracy .
But it 's not the idea of science and social society , and in the world , historically , people think about space , time and universe thinking about how to survive in society .
I want to talk about three three stages of evolution .
The first stage is that the universe is <unk> , and the science of the universe is <unk> .
And the Earth is on the center , and the second one is the sun , the moon , Earth , earth , ultimately the stars in the universe , in everything .
Aristotle <unk> the rules of all sorts of things , which is , of course , who live in the world of life , is that the social law of religion is more important , faith in religious social laws , <unk> that social rules .
And the idea is that it 's relative to the last layer .
Everything that 's all recognized , the things that are <unk> in the end of the screen , is the perfect <unk> of God , and it 's going to live in love with God .
This is Aristotle , who is in certain ways , is the social society .
In the 16th century , Newton got a revolution in space , time and motion , etc .
In the same period , John Rockwell and his partner led to social thinking .
These two changes are connected .
Indeed , Darwin and Wilson are friends .
And they think about space , time , sports , thinking about the other , for social purposes , they thought about it .
I 'll tell you that .
There is no central universe -- thank you .
There are particles that are <unk> in a very solid space where they 're <unk> around .
In the context of space , it does n't make sense of meaning because this definition is not restricted to other sorts of things , but it 's a relatively <unk> space in Newton .
Similarly , something like this , in <unk> , some people who have less power , and some of the other people are being seen as an absolute , abstract force , justice , etc , or so on .
<unk> , of course .
There 's a <unk> observer , and he 's <unk> everything , he is a God who says , in the universe , because he does n't exist on the world , but in other ways , it 's ubiquitous because of the space , God knows everything .
That 's what this is called " traditional <unk> " and the foundation of Newton .
By the beginning of 20 century , there was a change in this change , until it still persists today .
And the history of relativity and quantum physics emerged this transformation .
The combination of <unk> , the end of the space of space - time , is the interior of this space , until it 's the same thing .
In the universe , none of them are absolutely absolute .
And the universe is a network of connection .
<unk> is just one thing , so it does n't make sense .
There is only a relatively opposite thing .
And this connected network is still evolving .
So what we call the " <unk> universe . "
All of the principles of things are in those connections .
And if you 're in this connection , you have the same information between the network and the Internet network , and it 's directly connected by this connected network .
We do n't have the bedrock of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the individual .
This is normal relativity , quantum theories .
And if you go to the law , this is the foundation of the laws of law .
They 're all about the same .
But not only that , they 're not always interested in relativity .
An interesting discussion about that .
We 're just talking about the idea of <unk> idea .
And what it 's mostly about is that there 's nothing wrong about the universe , and it does n't mean that everything is <unk> .
In this connection , when you see some kind of patterns , the structure of the building is the whole thing , like these devices , or some beautiful things , as all the lives of all life , " man " means men and women .
As a person , you want to know how to do it .
And in contact with the universe , the only explanation is that , through some way , they create themselves .
In the universe , there 's a self - organizing structure that 's created by institutions , and everything is created .
Because you do n't exist in the universe , and it 's fundamentally <unk> and Newton .
In connection , we have a process of organizing ourselves .
And Darwin told us , the process of self - organization is rich , and it explains ourselves .
Self - organizing theory , it 's not only when you think about how nanotechnology works , and you can see the natural theory of natural selection only about this relationship .
<unk> : It 's a kind of a relationship between natural selection , the relationship of health relationships to vary between species and species .
And Darwin 's equations are saying that there are too many ways to talk about the universe in Newton .
So based on biology , the idea of natural selection needs to be connected to understanding the underlying properties of biology .
And further Nature is the most designed universe in the universe , and all of the attributes of this universe are connected .
Not only , but Einstein told us that the world is connected to each other .
If you do n't have eco - <unk> , life will have a lifetime of stars , to make sure that the stars are not going to prevent the world , like the surface of the Earth , for billions , billions of years , allowing the life to develop a lot of <unk> , which can be developed in a lifetime - long period of time , so that life can develop its own interventions , it allows us to increase the <unk> of the entire world , where it 's going to lead to the growth of life
In the 20th century , we saw the independent development of science in the 20th century .
In biology , people are exploring the <unk> of self - organize , complexity and purity .
This is the achievement of the new meme .
<unk> , this theory of cognitive learning , economics and development .
And at the same time , we 're trying to understand research in understanding research , <unk> quantum theory and relativity .
In our research , it 's the universe that does n't make sense of connection .
And the science of the 21st century will be able to think about the <unk> of these two ideas , and on the other side , there 's a way to figure out the world on the other side , and in the other direction , there 's a way to study world - organizing information or Darwin ?
In the 21st century , we 're dealing with the research and the future of the universe , and it 's going to continue to move on .
And their development is two - minded modes : <unk> and <unk> .
If you look at democracy , democracy is going to be released , that you know that there 's a whole range of different types of interest , different different kinds of <unk> .
Each is <unk> , because we 're in a connected network .
Anyone who has a democracy in a connected network .
Some people might be <unk> in some field , so there 's always a lot of art to engage and play , which is politics .
<unk> , from the theory , is that we 're talking about our own connection , the Internet network for better life , to create better social societies .
I think the science is never coming around us .
In fact , I 've been coming . It 's always going to be us .

What 's the small dinosaur in the world ? In 9th grade , <unk> <unk> tells us how to do it through the skull .

<unk> <unk> : Building the dinosaurs
And now I think that 's the age of my age , and you 're going to take your hand on your hand .
I want to know how many people in the room are in three to 12 years old ?
Okay ?
I know .
I 'm going to talk to you today about the dinosaurs .
Do you remember how much you prefer dinosaurs ?
The dinosaurs is very interesting .
But today , this is true .
We need to look at them .
And I learned some things from dinosaurs , and that 's how to try to get extinct .
That 's it .
People often ask me , actually , what 's the most important question that kids like to do ?
What are the special candidates for the dinosaurs ?
And then I would say that the dinosaurs was so big , and they were very different .
Yes , all the dinosaurs died .
But I ca n't wait for a thousand years .
So the whole thing is very , very different , and it 's already <unk> .
The theme of this talk is to say , " Well , why the dinosaur is <unk> .
We have the dinosaurs .
<unk> , <unk> .
There 's a lot of different types .
About a long time ago , there was a lot of excitement in the early days of the early 20th century .
They collect the fossil record .
This process is very interesting .
Because every museum requires a better dinosaur than anyone else .
So if you look at a garage museum in Toronto , you have a big , <unk> museum , a lot of <unk> .
And almost everything was in the museum .
So all of you are looking at the big dinosaur .
This was at the beginning of the century .
And in 1970 , some scientists started thinking about what 's going on .
Look at these dinosaurs .
All that big .
What is the origin of the dinosaurs ?
And scientists started thinking about this problem , and the question is , " Where is the little dinosaur ? "
And if you go to the museum , you find a few little dinosaurs .
And people assume -- this is the question of the problem , and people assumed that if small dinosaurs , or <unk> , it 's really easy to be <unk> .
Because the dinosaurs should have a little dinosaurs .
But we 're seeing all these things .
Here 's a few questions .
First of all , scientists are very upset about the dinosaurs .
They like to name anything .
Everybody wants to give himself a new animal for <unk> .
So every time they find a new species , they look a little bit different .
So we have a whole bunch of different names .
And in 1975 , the brain was suddenly shocked .
This man is <unk> Peter , who realized the evolution of dinosaurs is very similar to birds , and it does n't do different than the birds .
And then he took the <unk> .
And it 's really cool -- in fact , all the birds in the upper hemisphere are cool because they 're starting to grow 80 percent of the weight of the adult population , where they 're going to start growing up in the first age of adult disease , which is starting to grow up to growing the number of other people who start to increase the birth of HIV / AIDS , so that they 'll start developing the <unk> of their own species , to growth the percentage of its brain , growing in its head .
Think about this now .
They actually kept the characteristics of <unk> until the process of development .
This is a very rapid developed .
So if you look at a developed <unk> , you ca n't see it , and you 're not sure that it 's a <unk> ; you feel that this is two different kinds of animal .
So this is the problem , Peter <unk> knows this , so he takes a <unk> .
And he <unk> his childhood with adults , and if it grows in a linear fashion , it 's about half the size of a adult .
But in fact , <unk> is going to do a little amount of <unk> in the adult .
That 's interesting .
This is where people think about their minds .
I mean , if people can accept the <unk> of Peter <unk> , we have a lot of <unk> .
But remember , scientists are very upset , and especially in the name of things .
So when they found that they did n't have a different dinosaur , it would n't be glamorous .
Now we have a way to fold a dinosaur , or any kind of animal , adult childhood .
So that was the cut of the bone .
But you can also imagine the bones of a dinosaur , because in the museum , these bones are very precious in the museum .
They packaged each bone .
They 've got a coat coat <unk> .
That 's good .
If you get out of the <unk> and say , " Well , you 're not going to have a lot of <unk> looking at the bone .
So in general , we do n't have the opportunity .
But I also had a museum that I found , and I did n't feel like I 'd cut these bones .
So I cut it .
If you look at the bones of a smaller dinosaur , you find a lot of <unk> , and it 's a big <unk> .
And if you look at the bones of the old dinosaurs , you find that the <unk> of the old dinosaurs are very tight .
So you know that this is an emerging bone .
It 's easy to see .
Now look at this .
In North America , in the North East , the <unk> of the United States and Canada of America are in southern southern <unk> , and there 's a continuous population called " The Garden of <unk> <unk> . "
There 's 12 of us who can see that this is 12 years old , and that 's 12 years old .
We 're now .
This is about research .
So , my students , other employees , we cut these bone together .
You know , you know the <unk> of a dinosaur , but if you go to the museum , and you ask them , " Hey , let 's lock your dinosaurs out ? "
And they would say , " Give me <unk> . "
So , 12 dinosaurs in this 12 .
Let 's start with these three guys .
These three are owned by <unk> .
And you all think that there are two relationships between them .
People assume they 're <unk> or so on .
But never before , they 've never seen it much better than that .
In other words , they 're seeing differences between them .
But if you want to make a <unk> relationship between two people , you do n't see how different they have .
It 's about finding their common common .
And now people look at this three different places .
There 's also a couple of filaments that have got a little bit of <unk> <unk> .
And the second dinosaur -- <unk> and <unk> live in the same period of time .
It 's a very small <unk> , too .
And the third dinosaur is called <unk> , and it 's called " <unk> <unk> . "
It 's because it describes the <unk> of the novel .
It 's very similar to it , and it 's <unk> <unk> , the nose on the nose , but not yet .
No one is aware of this three - dinosaur <unk> , which is very similar .
And they came up with this , and they said , " This is the three different <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is more glamorous than that .
And I do n't understand what they 're seeing .
And if it comes from the skull , it becomes something that goes through the size .
The second number of <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
Is n't that possible for us ?
But they did n't find them .
We know why .
Because scientists are most favorite .
So , if we closed the skull , the windows -- I 've got my toes -- and I 'm going to see my <unk> .
This is a piece of a childhood dinosaur , and it 's very quickly .
It 's going to be big .
And if you look at the bone bone , it 's also the same .
It 's grown up with smaller portions of <unk> .
Very quickly .
The most interesting thing about the brain is that the head of the <unk> is so fast , it 's too fast .
And the <unk> <unk> , which is in <unk> means , is that it 's going to be smaller and smaller , and it 's getting smaller and smaller .
And the <unk> that we 're going to see here are very glamorous , and it 's also <unk> <unk> .
So , the light that comes from the three dinosaurs as a scientist , and we 're very easily concerned about this : this is the same animal growing up .
And so that <unk> had to be " extinct . "
Okay .
And now we 're still going to study about 10 dinosaurs .
I studied with a church in Berkeley .
We found that in 2000 -- I think it was in the 19th century , but before 2000 , I never saw a child 's Jupiter .
There 's almost virtually all the <unk> fossils in the world , almost a <unk> <unk> .
We all know why , right ?
Because everybody wants it .
So there 's a big deal in the museum .
And I was looking around with my colleagues and found a lot about the <unk> <unk> .
They 're everywhere .
So now we have a whole bunch of <unk> in our museum now .
I think that 's because I have a little museum .
The natural museum is a little dinosaur .
Take a look at the <unk> , and you can see it change , right ?
The slope of the <unk> grew up in <unk> is to bend the line back .
But when they get older , they become backwards .
Is n't that cool ?
So if we look at the Swiss ' Oscar , there 's a lot of little <unk> <unk> that grew up , and they 're growing up in the edge of the <unk> , which is the equivalent of <unk> .
I have a lot of kids in my museum in the museum , and I pulled it off .
And it turns out that little <unk> bone bone is in <unk> .
And also in the middle of the high sized nucleus , there 's also a gradient of <unk> .
But the most interesting thing is , the bone vessel in the <unk> is <unk> .
It 's all over a long period of time .
Very big .
But there 's another piece of dinosaurs in this <unk> , which is very similar to the <unk> .
When we cut the <unk> bone , we found that it was very mature .
But there 's this huge hole on the <unk> .
Everybody said , " <unk> and <unk> ca n't be the same animal , because it 's better than that .
And you have a hole on the side .
And I asked them , " Do you see the <unk> <unk> ? "
And they said , " No , it 's not yet . "
So , my student , John <unk> , who came up with all of our books , and he finally realized that the hole in the <unk> has begun to form the fossil record , of course , to <unk> a fossil <unk> that was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
So we know that the <unk> is actually growing up by the <unk> .
When we give a name to the dinosaurs , it tends to be the same as the name of the dinosaur , and it 's a lot of <unk> that we have to do .
So the <unk> is <unk> .
And by the end of the tube , if you look at the news , it 's a lot of news .
And they think they should survive " <unk> " , " but it does n't happen .
Okay , so we can use this .
So , for example , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk>
It 's a big <unk> .
And they 're both <unk> .
And also , we 're starting from their <unk> .
And the <unk> analysis tells us that the old age of <unk> is the dinosaurs , or the heroes of the ages , and the Chinese dinosaurs are <unk> .
" <unk> " is extinct .
So we can do that constantly .
The last thing I 'm going to tell you about is <unk> dressing .
Now we have two <unk> of <unk> and <unk> shooting .
Now we have <unk> <unk> .
But the reason they do is they 're very pervasive .
And they said , " <unk> , that 's 17 , big , 12 . "
How could this be the same ? We do n't know where dinosaur dinosaurs are .
So they have two different kinds of dinosaurs .
So I closed them all .
And it turns out that when I think it 's the same as the death of the child , the <unk> of the child , the <unk> of the year .
It 's still growing up .
There 's a couple of miles of <unk> in my work , and I have the opportunity to cut them all over .
But I found that I did n't have to do that because I was just a simple <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and the largest one in the <unk> is 12 years old .
And of course , it 's about 17 <unk> .
And then we went to the other museum , and we found a hotel that had 15 <unk> in the museum .
And then the next thing is , it 's a very simple thing to do with the <unk> of <unk> , and we 're going to get a name that is <unk> in the dinosaurs .
So in <unk> , we have seven dinosaurs .
This is number number .
It sounds like a lot more .
And you know that the theme of my talk is probably not glamorous at the eighth of the week .
They like their dinosaurs and their faces .
This is not what it looks like .
Thank you .

And the best <unk> of <unk> <unk> came in at the stage of the <unk> , and when he used his head to his <unk> and his fabulous texts , <unk> Obama , George Bush and other other worlds , looked at some other inside the interior of some TED <unk> .
comedy , global issues , military , performance , politics
<unk>
Yves Behar on one person 's <unk>
And Chris always did .
I do n't know how you think Chris is Chris .
So the <unk> , the whole week , and he 's a dancer that allows you to <unk> people , " Chris , I 'm really sorry for you .
And the worse thing is , I took the car off .
And your house is so <unk> .
And then you 've got your best friends to do . "
You know , Chris would say , " Thank you . "
" Thank you for sharing , that 's really interesting . "
" Thank you I did n't know where I was , thank you . "
One of the great ones in TED , Thank you for inviting us .
It 's a week in the TED conference , and it <unk> , as long as time , all the speakers tell you .
<unk> , I 've got 10 minutes on this .
<unk> is another aspect of the spectrum .
parallel universes .
So this morning I thought , " Okay , I 'm going to do a magic magic trick . "
This is also used .
So today , I think we all agree with this , right ?
<unk> ? No , absolutely .
I thought I would end up with a dance .
So now it 's going to look very square .
So what I 'd like to do is , I 'm going to make the first TED Prize for <unk> -- I 'll have the first TED ticket .
If I can start , this is a <unk> jet engine .
Who 's going to start with a thousand dollars ? Who ?
Thank you . Look at the face of the cards , and his face tells me , " No , do n't do it , do n't do it , do n't do it .
Do n't do it , do n't you ? "
When I get invited , I 'm worried that they 're saying , they say , " You can change the world for 15 minutes to change world - changing world . "
I do n't know how you 're going to change me in 15 minutes .
So , the idea of changing the world is <unk> .
Because we 've got consciousness , we do n't have to move to change . We 've just seen a wondrous demo about radio attacks , magic , you know .
If you were 300 years old , he would be <unk> .
But now it 's a idea .
This is incredible , this is magic .
But you 're also going to meet more magical characters , some of the world 's filmmakers .
In yesterday , the other person who talked about the people I 've told you .
But when you look at the world , it would enable Starbucks to be a new experience , and do n't you think about it ?
I mean , he 's going to go into it , and they say , " You want to get rid of the <unk> , or you 'll get a ticket or a milk or a milk ? "
And then he would say , " You 've got an infinite number of <unk> . "
" Are you sure your coffee is coffee ? "
And they say , " Do you mind us a little bit ? "
And then this is yesterday 's <unk> , and she 's really great .
<unk> , good .
And her talk is about the pioneer of water , and of course , with the connection between the <unk> evolution between Darwin , is that we 're all <unk> by the body , we do n't have a <unk> .
She said , you know , she 's 90 ; she says she does n't have time .
She found more evidence about this link .
And I thought , " I 'm sitting next to me . "
And this guy has <unk> the Arctic , and how many evidence do you want ?
Here he is here .
And that 's what TED is connecting us to .
I did n't have to do it yesterday yesterday . I do n't see the <unk> maker , I 'm sorry .
I 'm really sorry .
I 'm really sorry , really , really true .
Really , really true .
" Question solves the world . "
My question for the maker is , because the creator , he 's standing there , and he looks like a bear bear in a bar .
" Hello , what can I tell you about the tree ?
Oh , no .
" Sorry , I have 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving Earth , global governance .
We work in the climate change , and I do n't have 18 minutes , but I ca n't tell you how much we 're going to do it at the West , as we 've done in <unk> .
In the northern hemisphere we 're building in the north , and the exciting news is that it 's the only time that this week , the last week , the only wind in the United Nations is <unk> .
And unfortunately , I do n't have time to mention that . "
That 's what the U.K. is doing .
No .
" Christian attraction , ladies . "
You 're not born , you should n't say that your neighbors are n't born your neighbor . "
" But tell me , when I was 11 years old , it was a problem . "
" Okay , really , really .
Okay , <unk> , real .
I can say <unk> , because she 's a nice dancer , my wife , with beautiful smile .
And this reminds me , I must say , " I 'm going to tell you that . "
" I think , you know , people are happy , and they 're always good .
Well , not like " <unk> " -- you know , I wrote a piece of paper in my career , saying , " Can I get to your support ? " And he said no , you ca n't see it , because I 've never seen anybody like that .
Another thing that can be mentioned in his talk is that in 2002 , the mayor of London , in the ' 80s , has n't heard this thing .
But people , when people were talking about this industrial economy , he said , " London in London , we , as governments , will make the same effect on the whole economy . "
When you think about what happens to your service , you see the change in the economy , and you want to . " That 's a <unk> person . "
But we 're in a <unk> . We 're at a completely new world .
And I can start to remember that if you receive a funeral from your bank , you do n't know that you 're going to have money from him , or he 's going to take money from you here .
Okay ?
These are the things that are <unk> , Iceland , networks .
Anybody know what Iceland bank accounts for ?
Why do you know ? Why is it that somebody will wake up from Nigeria , right ?
Ask your bank .
And then you know , Iceland , from no contracts .
It never happens .
What does it have ? There 's a lot of fish there .
And this is why the CIA 's going to come up with television , and say , " This is a very big <unk> for us .
I do a lot of things that I 'm trying to think about before I try to understand it .
But it 's <unk> <unk> .
Fortunately , people like George Bush are very useful .
And he came up with this , really , in a <unk> .
And he said , " <unk> <unk> . "
" And now you 're still <unk> . "
And that is , you know , this is the metaphor that enables people to be able to make a sense of intimacy .
Obviously this metaphor allows the Bush to be otherwise .
The other person , of course , is <unk> , and said , " There 's something wrong about the world , they know what we know about us .
It 's also known that we do n't know what we know about ourselves , and they do n't know what they do .
There 's no reason why they do n't know what we 're not aware of . "
And I was doing this for a U.K. , and I thought , " It 's really <unk> . "
But now , in fact , that 's true .
This is what <unk> said about , the chaos of chaos , which is because , they do n't know what they 're doing .
In 2006 , the American <unk> <unk> said , I quote , " Well , we can be able to see and do n't see what 's going on to the United States . "
That 's the person who 's very excited about this .
But , as soon as the crisis happened , the big <unk> of <unk> <unk> said , " This happened for every 10,000 years , and over three days . "
So this is <unk> . This is a very tough explanation .
But we 've got a new hope , we have a new character .
America was elected a black president in the United States .
Good news .
It 's not just that , he 's still <unk> , you notice ?
How many people are there ?
You see a lot of people who have great artists , great art , greatest thinkers , they 're <unk> .
And someone said to me , you know , what you have to learn is to have a <unk> , and you have to write at the same time .
And you 've got a lot of people talking about the metaphor .
And I thought , well , this is really a good metaphor , right ? A <unk> that does n't <unk> the Incredible <unk> .
Do you like this one ? Are you going to see George Bush , OK ?
And I think maybe it 's the oceans , right ?
" Well , you know , I 'm sorry .
I 'm only the only ones on the top , but I still do it . "
But , you know , he 's <unk> , and now he does n't laugh .
This is eight years of my history in the United States , and I have eight minutes of <unk> .
" It 's an era .
I also believe it 's a time end .
I know a lot of people say that this is one of the greatest moments of American history .
But we demonstrated that they were wrong in Iraq .
They say that Iraq and <unk> have no relationship .
There is now . "
" But I have a message to the people who are meat that <unk> themselves . "
" We 'll find you . "
" We 're not sure you 're going to be one day . "
But now he <unk> , and we 're lucky enough to see the speakers in the American history of the United States in America , Obama .
You might have succeeded in the election .
And he said to the people in Chicago , " If people are there , there 's a place where there are all sorts of things that can happen to the United States . "
I ca n't just finish . I 've got time . It 's true .
But you know what I mean .
And he <unk> with his wife , and they divided each other , they made a <unk> .
And then George Bush sit there , " <unk> . "
" No , do n't you ? <unk> . "
But interestingly , <unk> Brown is talking about this , and they say , people will listen to speech , they 're saying , " Great talk . "
And then they 're going to watch the <unk> , and they say , " Let 's march . "
We all want to believe Obama .
It 's like , " <unk> in <unk> . "
You remember the Helen <unk> and Jack <unk> film , and when Jill Tarter says , " How do you see me ? "
And then <unk> <unk> , " You ask me to become a better person . "
You want a <unk> that allows you to become a better citizen , right ?
But there was one thing to do .
We love Obama Obama , but we do n't have any action .
So he came to this country , and he said , " We need a financial positive . "
And all of the people said , " Okay . " He 's leaving this country and France and Germany , and it 's not , you know , no , it does n't happen . It 's no longer happening .
And he said , " We need to make Afghanistan . "
And everyone says , " Okay . "
And then he went away , and people said , " No , no , do n't we do that .
Fifty percent of the most , not rockets , no rockets ; no , do n't do it . "
And he came to the grave and said , " We believe a liberal free world . "
There 's a very clever American <unk> that can be really <unk> , and we 'll let it go .
Do you remember ? George Bush , <unk> .
Sorry , what ? "
You can say , " <unk> , please . "
Thank you .
But Barack Obama said , " We need a <unk> free world . "
And then I was on the day , and he was looking at it before it was tested that could n't penetrate Japan to Japan .
So what do we do ? We have Bill Clinton .
" The world . "
" I think , I believe that <unk> <unk> said to God .
" <unk> <unk> , <unk> . "
" She said , " she said . "
" Some people . "
" Make a better world , if you can .
I just think that 's important , really .
I 'm also very hopeful that Fred <unk> can be in the White House , so she wo n't be 4 years .
That 's me , you know . "
" So , when this does n't work , I have to make a box for you , let me tell you . "
So this is him . In Britain , we have Charlie <unk> . ' ' Environment is really important .
My wife has begun to <unk> me , and I think it 's going to raise emissions in her territory . "
Or , here are South Africa , and we have Nelson Mandela as an agreement .
Nelson Mandela , unfortunately , Daniel .
There 's now a statue now .
At the end of the year in Britain , the <unk> show comes from one <unk> .
" So , John , you want a nice <unk> ? "
" <unk> , listen to me . "
" I 've been in prison for 30 years in a <unk> island .
Why do I have a <unk> ? "
Every minute : I do n't know how to end the talk until yesterday , a quote from the Japanese Japanese <unk> , saying , " It 's not a good thing to do , because it 's a space that is there .
Thank you very much indeed .

In this remarkable talk , architect <unk> <unk> shares a lot of special jobs : <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> -- the walls are burning , and they 're going to be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> into the mouth of a passion .
architecture , art , arts , design , theater
<unk>
Yves <unk> plays the building
Except , besides <unk> ice and provides some kind of space , architecture is just a <unk> machine for human senses .
Our professional profession has all the same shapes and sizes .
It 's <unk> . It 's a cow .
Or from the city , from <unk> to the theater and everything .
They have a common mind , which is the challenge of what people think about space .
These are our habits , and those are very obvious things that we stop eating .
I collect samples of design , and they did a certain effect , glamorous <unk> .
Like nothing , or almost no .
In our natural world , we 're doing it in all kinds of <unk> or impacts .
This is one of the leading <unk> that we did at the University of California in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We do n't just use the background , but a fundamental <unk> .
We 're building a atmosphere building .
So , without walls , there 's no <unk> , no use -- it 's just <unk> <unk> , a large <unk> .
This suggestion has <unk> responses . In the latest industries of greenhouse technologies , we 're looking for energy and <unk> energy to do a better visual anesthesia .
The state of the <unk> has become mainstream .
We proposed the car , and we can use technology , high technologies , to <unk> the space of <unk> , the spaces of challenge and the <unk> of the challenge , in a new way of thinking about the senses .
That 's what we 're doing .
The <unk> of the <unk> is formed through the mouth of <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> by 35 people .
It will tell the temperature temperature , and <unk> , wind , metals , soy , <unk> will be able to fix the data that goes through the water .
This system is extremely <unk> training .
So this is n't just architecture , but a whole building .
This space has 300 feet , and it 's only between <unk> .
These are all <unk> <unk> , and the system is like to show weather change .
You do n't know why . We 're interested in weather .
Now , let 's show you the side of the world , and then you start to vary from the outside space .
It 's unlike normal spaces , and it 's like a place where <unk> can live in place .
It 's invisible , not normal , <unk> , non - controller , no purpose .
Get rid of all the <unk> , only one light of <unk> and white noise .
It 's like a railway station that you ca n't see and do n't do anything .
And we 're very proud -- this is the other world that 's going to attract people to the eye .
So , the attention of <unk> is to focus on the building of space , and all of a sudden it gets stuck behind it because it 's a continuous <unk> .
This is the way that <unk> <unk> uses <unk> .
This is going to become the focus of the world , all of the attention .
As you know , you 're always looking at the water , but actually you see water from <unk> <unk> .
So , the water <unk> the whole world , and people think we 're going to walk here and breathe in this building .
This is a <unk> , but we should get into understanding .
What we really want to do is depend on <unk> senses , using sensory senses .
And we did this project very easily , because <unk> said , " Why are we going to use a thousand dollars a year to make a difference ?
The answer to that is to try to convince them .
Ultimately , you know , this will become a symbol of a country . We call the Swiss <unk> , and you understand , it 's a <unk> machine .
Anyway , it 's just a close - end structure that 's going to be <unk> , and yet it is only a little bit , but it still has a <unk> .
This is the <unk> of our <unk> architects -- a chocolate .
Anyway , we tried to do it anyway .
Eight , 2009 , we all know about independent jobs , like <unk> , artists , architects , museum and science .
We 've done a lot of press jobs , and lots of <unk> experiments .
In 2003 , at the end of the 19th century , we 've got a lot of people from 80 , 90 ' 90s .
But , look at the essence of the nature , rather than <unk> . These are part of the display .
Now , this is one part of the U.S. trade .
This is <unk> <unk> .
This is the " <unk> and <unk> of <unk> Foundation . "
Now the project in the Museum of Modern Art in New York is called " <unk> . "
And there 's a lot of stuff .
And regardless of the way they do it , they give the entire <unk> show , but you know that the problem is , we do n't like it .
It 's kind of like the invention of the museum , and it 's the theory that you have to vary in a form of <unk> .
Our job is to achieve this purpose .
And this theme , in fact , is in a little bit of the <unk> of a museum , and it 's a lot of <unk> in the museum .
So what you 're seeing here is a lot of <unk> in this picture .
We actually need to paste on white walls .
But these <unk> become a weapon and concepts .
We divided this project into <unk> , and we 're going to make sound and vision .
And you can see , actually , the red blue line shows that the <unk> state , creating a new layer on the wall , and we use a <unk> robot around the museum .
This <unk> is <unk> to a robot arm .
And we use bees , which is the brain .
The designers of bees are <unk> , and they 're really interesting about them .
They do n't do their first job , in helping us stop the government .
In any circumstances , it 's based on the position of smart remix maps .
So , it opens up 300 feet .
It 's a random <unk> model .
Use the <unk> to <unk> accurate , and then you 've got to start with a leopard <unk> beginning .
The first <unk> of these holes are just white walls , but as the photography does on the walls .
The walls of the walls are connected to the sides of the <unk> angle .
These holes open up the wall .
This is the result of three months of <unk> .
<unk> is already broken .
It 's also about the visual part .
And there are people who are <unk> , very weak .
This is a very glamorous space video thick .
It 's a very neutral place to look at the <unk> of art .
And this <unk> and vision of the visual <unk> is very glamorous , including natural memories of nature .
It starts to break the <unk> <unk> . It 's really great .
And look at a project we did a year ago .
This is in Oxford in Boston , in the art of <unk> .
We do n't have a lot of time to introduce this building , but I 'm going to say that the building is looking down at the bottom of the equation , and it 's a very nice place in Boston , which is <unk> .
So the natural physical trait of the building is to look at how it is -- and I mean , it 's a basic goal .
This building is <unk> around the environment , but it <unk> a lot of detail , and detail goes on the museum .
So , you go to the base of the building , and you 're going to go into the theater and it 's <unk> and <unk> the space .
You walk into the glass ceiling .
This elevator is <unk> in New York .
And then the vision starts to go up , and then you go into the theater , it 's going to be able to figure out whether you can do it or reject the perception .
A lot of <unk> chose to put this theater out of the theater .
And on the bottom of the theater , we see the natural light that goes into the <unk> of <unk> .
This space of space , unfortunately , has never been done before .
In a very tough space , it relates to the <unk> of the West and <unk> , and it 's really not that you 're going to link <unk> to you , but let 's move the visual path to change .
Because imagine <unk> and <unk> said , " No , we 're going to open it up . "
The designers are predicted here .
But it 's also the reason -- this is why I put it in the talk , and that 's the <unk> of the building .
This is an 80 foot long -- it 's extremely rugged .
And it 's been <unk> enough for a lot of space , and this little space is called <unk> .
There 's something like 16 people standing in the public to look at the figures to the number of art or <unk> .
This is an important part of the building , and this is a little bit of architecture -- it 's like a <unk> , which is just a framework , but it can only edit the head angle through the walls , through walls and the ceiling , to see the amount of electrons that are made of <unk> or <unk> and <unk> .
And we 're really really sure that this is a great technology , and it 's also the design of nature .
But there 's no information . It 's just a <unk> state .
We looked at the <unk> .
This is the first engineer in the project , 50 years ago .
We 're taking away from some of these little <unk> to <unk> and device .
But we do n't have passion .
This is going to be done in 2010 .
And the purpose of this presentation , I hope , is a part of a project , and even a little bit of the theme of that kind of building , the subject of <unk> , which is our live , <unk> .
This is a joke by <unk> <unk> , and it 's on the bottom of the street and below the streets .
And here , this is the first time that we 're going to try and reconstruct , and we first started tinkering .
And we ask ourselves , why do n't you <unk> it a little bit ? Like <unk> pyramids or other buildings ?
One thing that we 're asked to be asked is that the main building of the street , the <unk> of the street , makes it <unk> in vision .
And this building is natural <unk> .
We basically <unk> , architecture , in this fiery space of space , on the other side of this <unk> room , about three square feet , which is about 45 feet tall , and it 's a <unk> .
<unk> soda and vinegar .
As a matter of a minute , this is just a little bit about what we 're doing .
But what I want to do is to take a couple of seconds to talk about <unk> itself , and we 're really on top of it .
This <unk> is a multi - channel street .
The customer asked us to design a best interior hall .
Now , design a car seat is very easy to look very easily .
<unk> , <unk> and micro - sponsors , they ask us to connect the components of each other .
How do you get intimacy to intimacy ?
<unk> intimacy is something different .
It means <unk> and visual intimacy .
One is the road , often from the corner , from underneath the hall .
We have to change the shape of the lobby .
It 's like a <unk> , basically sending all sorts of sounds , like an <unk> .
The surface of the wall is absorbing material material , and half the <unk> , it does n't diminish the sound of sound .
This is <unk> <unk> , but Dean Kamen , visual junk , is very , very important , approaching the visual <unk> .
Because we do n't have a seat for 18 inches per second .
So it 's very , very thin building .
First of all we have a box of box , and we 're going to stop the noise of the transportation .
And then you put the whole thing up -- like the <unk> keyboard -- with some material <unk> , <unk> <unk> all the walls : the brain is <unk> .
But <unk> will look at the sound of the car and go back to the stage , and this is a <unk> .
Watch the top of the room . It 's just the equator .
It 's just allowing all sorts of stuff , and it 's -- you can imagine anything that can fall from high - performing shells .
But there is a function .
So we 've got all the vision of all of the visual seals , anything that impacts the building , and we want to combine architecture , the audience and the website , to connect , <unk> , architecture .
We believe in the streets , the theaters of the halls , and when it comes to the <unk> and the Macintosh .
So we want to make these -- this effect , <unk> , we have <unk> <unk> .
We need to use windows , very thick , and these structures are used like the wood of the wing , which is used in the whole conference of <unk> , <unk> the lights on the table , like a <unk> light , rather than a surface , not separate , as a stage .
This is an <unk> model for you to give you a whole scale .
This is a boy from <unk> , and this is what they look like outside .
And for us , I think this is really weird stuff , but in the halls of the weekend , when audiences sit down , it 's the moment that the audience is sitting in front of it , and it starts to feel like <unk> <unk> , which is a little bit of passion .
This is the building of <unk> .
Because I ended up , and that 's my end .
Thank you very much .

<unk> <unk> on how to make oxygen
About 17 years ago I started swimming in the air .
And my doctor told me that I had lost 70 percent of the year , and it would have died .
In <unk> , in India , the research in the Indian energy Institute of the NASA Foundation , and the help of a NASA Institute for NASA , we found three general kinds of <unk> .
We also found that this would be able to get rid of the solid atmosphere , and the demand for the <unk> is <unk> .
These three plants are : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
They have their slides on the slide .
<unk> is a swimming carbon dioxide , and it converted into oxygen plants .
We need to have <unk> <unk> in our average , and in the plants of plants , we have to wipe down the leaves , in Delhi , to <unk> the city every day .
We have to use the sail with the Nintendo <unk> , and it 's the way that they 're going to be <unk> ; or the water goes down , and four months into the plants that will go into the circulation .
The second plant is <unk> , and it 's also a common crop , we call it the <unk> plants , because it will convert CO2 into oxygen .
We need six million high and a half million people .
The third plant is <unk> , and it 's a very common crop to <unk> water to water .
This plants can absorb <unk> and other chemicals .
These three plants , you can produce all the air you need .
In fact , you can even live in a bottle of ice , and you do n't need any air . You do n't need any air .
We came up with these plants in Delhi , and we tried to experiment in the jungle offices , which was a five - million square foot , 20 years old .
There 's 300 <unk> in buildings , and you put it down to <unk> plants .
And our research found out if a person in this building is about 10 hours of blood pressure , and his blood oxygen is growing up a little bit , if one person is in the building , the blood vessel 's blood flow in that building -- and if you 're in a building that 's a <unk> , he 's increasing oxygen , with a higher amount of oxygen in it .
There 's been discovered and documented that this is the most unhealthy building in New Delhi .
And research reveals what 's going on with the other building of other buildings , the lower <unk> of the human face , and the people in the neighborhood , <unk> <unk> , reduced <unk> . The problem is that the problem with Parkinson 's disease is less than 12 percent , less and less .
This research is published in August of 2008 , and it 's released from the <unk> website .
And according to our experience , using these plants , we 've got 20 percent of the astonishing improvement of this plant , and it 's a staggering increase in these plants , for 20 percent of the astonishing ones that have been consumed by those plants . Right ?
The use of the building is also about 15 percent , because no longer need to be able to put so much gas from the interior .
We 're now injecting this pattern up to a 100 square - meter building , and it 's going to put it into six <unk> plants .
Why should this study ?
It has a huge meaning for natural nature , because it 's going to depend on the next decade of the world .
Now , 40 percent of the world 's global energy is covered by the bedrock of 40 , and in the next 15 years , 15 percent will live in a population of population density . In the future of 15 , 60 world population will stay in population population . At 15 times the population , 80 percent is <unk> millions of cities .
And there are more people who prefer to live in air and work .
The world is ticking in the world . This is <unk> .
Thank you for listening .

The U.S. <unk> <unk> talks about politics and capitalism , and she said , well , women are not going to have a question of " <unk> , " which is often the most difficult question , but it 's a very interesting question . She shares a good question for the <unk> Media Center .
<unk> , business , <unk>
<unk>
Yves <unk> : A Women <unk>
<unk> Mitchell : What 's behind the story ?
<unk> <unk> : This is the <unk> of the ceiling .
<unk> : Ooh .
And I want to say that this is the <unk> of <unk> , and you 're going to get chosen .
<unk> : Most of the time in the morning , I was used to think about what was going on .
If you do n't speak about the story of Saddam Hussein , this story is not glamorous .
I 'll tell you what happens .
I 'm doing the American <unk> U.N. . That 's after <unk> . I 'm going to run <unk> .
<unk> has changed to a series of <unk> , and my interpretation is a terrible thing about Saddam Hussein , which is his -- because he invaded another country .
So all of a sudden , in the newspaper in Baghdad , there 's a couple of things that I call a lot of stuff , but it says " A <unk> <unk> . "
So I had a <unk> <unk> .
When we talk about Iraq , I take it .
And when I came up to meet , the focus of their focus is " Why are you wearing <unk> ? "
I said , " Because Saddam Hussein brings me to a glamorous snake . "
And I think , okay , well , that 's interesting .
And then I went to buy a lot of <unk> , and actually , these <unk> would come out of my day .
All of this is the beginning of the <unk> .
<unk> : So what do you collect ?
<unk> : Very much .
It 's all over the place .
It 's now in the <unk> , but it 's been in <unk> <unk> .
There 's a book called " Forget my <unk> . "
<unk> : That 's a great idea .
And I remember what you 're going to do for women in the first women , often a lot of articles at the end of the country , and your image is in many women -- especially when they 're dealing with the first women at the negotiating table .
So you have all these things ? <unk> : Yeah , it 's really <unk> , because nobody 's never described a male of men .
But people look at my deathbed .
What 's interesting is that when I went to New York , I talked to my leopard <unk> , and I said , " You have to give you your <unk> .
Go to shopping , <unk> look like a <unk> . "
So this brought me a lot of opportunities to shopping .
But there 's a whole bunch of questions about what I 'm wearing ? How many are my glasses ?
One thing is , if you remember <unk> <unk> , she 's wearing the <unk> and she <unk> his papers .
There are no men who are Carlos <unk> , but for women 's sake .
<unk> : For all of us , women and men , we need to find the way that we 're going to change our own way of changing the world .
How do you do this kind of balance that 's going to be the powerful <unk> of <unk> , which is to represent the power of our country to the world ? How can you think about yourself as a mom , a grandmother , " <unk> . "
How do you do that ?
<unk> : Okay , so interestingly , I 'm asked to be asked when I was appointed for the first American woman , and did n't have a few minutes to feel bad about the American women ?
And I said , " I 've got 60 years of a woman , but I have a couple minutes for a few minutes . "
So that 's what it is .
But basically I love as a woman .
And what happened is -- I think maybe some of you will assume this -- my first conference in the United Nations , when this conference is completely beginning , because the U.N. is a very glamorous organization .
I sat there -- 15 <unk> of <unk> , 14 men sitting there looking at me , and I think -- okay , you know what we feel .
You think of the air in the room , other people like me .
Can I say something smart ?
And suddenly I thought , hey , wait a minute .
I 'm sitting in front of the word " America , " and if I do n't talk about the sound of America today , it 's the first time I feel that I have to achieve my own personal <unk> , <unk> female pattern and decided I had to sing my <unk> .
And then , in different times , I think that in many ways , I think there are a lot of things that women are <unk> in .
And we 're reasonably good at relationships , and then our ability to get to the point is that it 's going to be more obvious .
But I have to tell you , I 'm the tiniest kid , she 's about seven years old , and she says , " What 's the big thing about my daughter ? "
<unk> is just a girl .
<unk> : It 's really true to her birth .
<unk> : It 's a big change .
Now , what do you do in the world , and you 're always doing something about the story of how women and girls are participating with girls ?
What 's our status ?
<unk> : We 're slowly changing , but obviously everything has changed in some countries .
So this means that we have to remember that many of us have a lot of opportunities in the world -- <unk> , you 've already become authentic leaders in your area , but there are many women who do n't want to worry about their own <unk> and to understand women .
So I feel -- I 've seen this in the National Safety security problem , and I decided that the question of women is that women are American , not only because I 'm a <unk> <unk> , but I believe that social <unk> will be more good when women get better and more powerful when the women were empowered to make political and economic change .
So I think it deserves us to try to understand -- we live in different countries , and we have the economy and the political community , we need to help other women get the same rights .
I was really concerned about the <unk> and the <unk> of the United Nations and then doing it .
<unk> : Did you feel that this is a key marriage to make women 's keys ?
<unk> : Some people .
And I think they think this is a problem .
I decided that the bottom line is that women are the most difficult questions , because these questions are in many ways -- and , as I said , it 's really the center of this thing that we think of .
For example , when I was in the middle of the town , there was a lot of war in wars , women were major victims .
So , for example , I 've been working on battles , some wars .
In <unk> women died .
And then we try to figure out a way to make a special <unk> in particular .
By the way , I did my job in the United Nations when I was in the United Nations , and I had the U.N.
There is now about 192 .
But it was the first time that I did n't have to worry about it .
And I said to my <unk> , " Please ask other women to vote . "
I think there 's a lot of women when I go to my room .
And I went there , and I had only six other women in <unk> .
<unk> women are the ones who represent Canada , <unk> , Philippines , oceans , purity , hydrogen and <unk> .
So as America represents , I decided to organize a conference .
We built it , we <unk> the meeting .
<unk> : That 's seven girls ?
<unk> : We 're <unk> the women .
We decided to put two women in this <unk> <unk> .
And what happened next is that they can announce rape is a war weapon , and it 's protected .
<unk> : So when you 've seen the world everywhere , in many cases -- especially in the West -- women are hiring more leaders , and even other areas are <unk> , but there 's still a lot of violence , still -- still , we still hear more women in <unk> .
You 've been told that there was no woman who had never seen it , maybe you -- a voice , or two people singing .
You know , can you tell us why it 's a big change in something like violence , conflict and conflict ?
<unk> : Well , I do think that when more women are participating in dialogue , the goal is changing .
But it does n't mean that the world is going to be okay for a lot of people who are pervasive .
If you think about it , you 've forgotten about high school .
But the bottom line is that there are more women in <unk> , and it 's a trying to make a difference .
For example , when I did what was done in <unk> , we brought women together to talk about a bunch of problems that were born with Rwanda .
So I think the power of women is to make them even more compassionate .
And it 's going to be done at the same time , if other women and women are <unk> .
When I was <unk> , there was only other species of 1.3 women .
So when we look at it , this is great .
So , for example , president of Finland in Finland , <unk> <unk> , but she was the foreign minister of Europe , and she was also a <unk> .
This is really incredible .
Because I want you to understand something .
We went to a meeting , and in our checklist , when I said , " Okay , I feel like we 're going to do something about it . "
And the <unk> sat down to me .
And suddenly we all talk about control , she says , " Okay , I feel that we should do this . "
And my male colleagues had a lot of <unk> .
But I think that this really helps some important women to engage in a series of activities of <unk> .
And the other important thing that I think is that a lot of the national security policy is not just about the military , and the military budgets are about the budget .
So if you have different components of <unk> , they can <unk> and create budgets in their countries .
<unk> : So how do we find that balance worldwide ?
How much of the sound of women 's voice ?
How many men would think that this man is the best of this person ?
<unk> : All right , I suppose one thing : I 'm a fellow of the National government Council of National <unk> , and it teaches women to help women .
And I think we need to help other countries to train women who are trained to engage and help them try to figure out how they can play their political skills .
I think we need to support that we have to make sure that women are helping each other .
Now what I want to say is that I feel very strongly , because I 've got a older age when I first started my career , and some other women <unk> me : " Why are you going to jump through the hallway ? "
Or " Are you sure your kids are not home ? "
I think we often make a difference .
In fact , I think that <unk> is the middle of every woman .
So what I think is going to happen is that we need help .
I have a place for <unk> women who do n't help .
<unk> : Okay , <unk> <unk> , I guess you will <unk> heaven .
Thank you so much to join us today .
: Thank you . Thanks very much .

<unk> : All good news about poverty .
Chris Anderson : I 'm going to have the last 25 years to <unk> the past 25 minutes .
This is a U.K. of England asking a story .
And I said , " Oh , Chris , that 's a trick . "
And he said , " <unk> , do n't you think that 's a good opportunity to show you your <unk> ? "
So -- good !
And then I thought , well , let 's go out of the <unk> , more than 25 years .
And let 's go back to the beginning of the <unk> of <unk> , when I was born in the first half of my life , and that human face face poverty and non - <unk> .
When the human culture was born in the <unk> , some slaves , people , who were <unk> <unk> -- and I thought , " Well , I 'm going to leave you with a black hole in front of a <unk> . "
The second thing is , " Oh , no !
You guys , the ones you have , in <unk> . "
And they said , " No , no ! No ! You see , our Bible is so telling us . "
Now we go back to this century , same country , the same pyramid , all sorts of people who are spreading , and it 's a different book .
This one is called <unk> .
The people came up in the hall of Cairo , in Cairo .
Combine the virtual social networks associated with the reality of the 21st century .
We do n't have to say that we stimulated the corporate world of the Arab <unk> , and it does n't necessarily say we separate technology in a role , but it 's all given us to <unk> -- when the old pyramid is going to push us down to the <unk> .
And this is also also telling us , like <unk> and the <unk> of the challenges that do n't equal , because the truth is that it 's like people , who are wanting to engage , and when they 're not constraints , they are the poorest people who have the freedom to be able to deal with the challenge , when we 're going to listen to what 's going on in 2005 , but it helps us to do a great generation of things that we need to confront , to <unk> the problem .
So I thought , forget about the rock , I forget my toes of the <unk> ice cream .
And today we 're only looking at <unk> , and I 'm just like that , a <unk> .
Now I 'm not rock - <unk> .
It 's a real evidence based on the facts , the truth of the truth .
Because the truth is to tell us that the long and slow journey of the human race is <unk> , it 's actually accelerating .
And look at our achievement .
So look at this image here .
And since 2000 , there 's over the world that there are more than five people who have been treated by the effective health of the world .
<unk> : There are eight countries reduction in sub - Saharan Africa in Sub - Saharan Africa .
<unk> percent of the deaths in the age of five , seven million dollars per year .
That means that there are four million children per day .
Wow ! Wow .
So let 's just stop . Let 's talk about it .
And in the last week you have read any news in any place that it 's important to get rid of this numbers ? Einstein !
This is a great good news . But let me calibrate the fact that most people do n't know the news .
Every day , eight children per day . These are two .
This is Michael and the Grand Canyon , and they 've lived , a huge deal of <unk> dancing -- she 's really great . And the global Foundation , you 've all elected it .
The global foundation provides for <unk> <unk> , and this drug can stop the HIV epidemic for kids .
The magic is n't happening .
It 's the result of <unk> , which is the purpose of the movement .
And the good news is that it 's more good than that , because it 's the progress of history .
The number of people who live in <unk> , the poorest people in the Arctic , from the end of the Cold War , has gone from <unk> to 2000 to 2010 .
Come on .
<unk> half .
Now , this ratio is still <unk> , and there 's still a lot of people who lose lives .
We have a lot of work .
But that 's what it 's about .
If you 're going to survive a thousand dollars per day , if you are poor , this is not just data , it 's not just data .
It 's all about you .
If you 're a parent , if you are the best thing to make your kids -- as I have today , it 's from <unk> to the path of despair .
Think about it , if this boat goes up -- and look , these are the people who live in the middle of the day .
Is n't that possible ? Maybe is it possible ?
That 's what data tells us . If you go to this path , we 'll get to -- wow !
And for people like ours , this is what 's called a sexy region , and now you can say , well , the data here is <unk> .
So in our models , extremely poor poverty , being defined for a hundred dollars per day , of course , in the ' 90s , which is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
We certainly love good ideas .
That 's great .
Now , I know somebody in the room thinks that this is happening in Asia or in Kenya , or <unk> , and who does n't like the <unk> of Brazil -- but look at sub - Saharan Africa .
There 's a range of 10 countries that are called <unk> , and they 've got over 100 million dollars in the last decade , three times a decade -- 10 times higher than the GDP -- and that 's the total wealth of the country , which is a nonprofit , so it 's going to be a good job for the community , but it is the local wealth , the global resources , when they 're being <unk> by a third of a second .
So , these are the revelations of this idea .
There 's all sorts of things .
First of all , you do n't have to have an excuse to hate a smile .
How do you do that ?
That 's the <unk> in <unk> ? Quick .
I mean , it 's about three times the <unk> of the orchestra .
I hope . I 'm like that .
And that 's why we 're young .
So why do n't we get excited ?
Well , opportunity and crisis .
We ca n't do it , unless we think we can achieve it .
Look at this chart .
This is called <unk> , which is how we <unk> it .
And the next thing is beautiful .
It 's called <unk> .
And that 's how we 're going to zoom in in the history of the past , just to do something that we know about things .
So it 's <unk> and <unk> against <unk> .
And of course , these are the challenges that you 've got to do , and you 've got to be <unk> , crisis .
We understand that <unk> are full of <unk> , right now .
In fact , the economic force in your country today is the tough moment , and those who are <unk> people want to stop life like a global foundation .
But you can do it .
And what you 're going to tell you is that there 's a lot of money in the details that you have .
Now , today , in the <unk> , the oil companies are going to take the price from the developing world to the government , and they 're trying to avoid it .
And you can do that .
You can join the <unk> of one <unk> , join leaders like <unk> <unk> .
We 're now pushing a law , and at least part of the <unk> wealth will be able to survive in the face of the land .
Now , we know that most of the disease is not disease , but corruption .
But that 's the same vaccine that can be avoided .
It 's called the <unk> , information of information , which is the TED community .
In the light , you can tell you , <unk> .
And technology really is <unk> .
It 's more difficult to reject .
I 'm going to introduce you to U - <unk> -- this is a very exciting thing to do . It 's based on a young generation of young people who are able to use <unk> mobile phones to <unk> the <unk> of the government , and to ask the sponsors and the income .
This is an exciting thing .
Look , once you have some tools , you ca n't do it .
And when you have these knowledge , you ca n't forget .
You ca n't <unk> your head , but you can <unk> these things to the history of history , poverty , poor people who ca n't manage their life . "
You can <unk> these , you can actually , because it 's no longer true .
This is an achievement .
2030 ? Back in 2030 , it 's not just for us for the <unk> , but it 's allowing us to use it .
At that point , the political regime around the world may not be like ...
So today I come here , I want to say that we 're going to come up here and try to figure out what 's going on in this beautiful building , and we call it <unk> <unk> .
It does n't stop you .
In fact , it 's going to save a lot of lives .
I think we , one of the founders of <unk> , wants you to be <unk> , spreading it , share it .
By the way , you 're going to join us with other kinds of people who believe that this is the largest <unk> that I believe in history , and that travel is to go to a disaster of equity .
Can we become the great generation of Mandela ?
I hope we used to survive . It 's rational , it 's <unk> , and I say , you know , emotions .
Because , obviously , the truth is <unk> .
I think <unk> <unk> .
You know , some of you know that he 's going to have a group of dolls that are <unk> behind the temple Area .
And he was stuck in the prison , but he 's deeply embedded in my head .
" We won it because we do n't know political .
We won the winning because we did n't have it .
We won the winning because we did n't have the foundations .
We won the wins because we 're looking at our hearts .
We won the winning , because we have dreams , and we need dreams for dreams . "
<unk> is right .
We 've won the winning , as we 've done , because the power of people 's rights is more powerful .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .

In 2007 , Paul <unk> did a way to make a difference about his own research , DNA <unk> , and this time , he proposed a lot of detail to describe the size of this area -- to create a very low - scale machine and make them self - assembly .

<unk>
Paul <unk> talks about DNA folding
People have a lot of <unk> .
How should it be <unk> , or <unk> or evolution ?
I do n't know the answer , so I 'm not going to tell you about this .
I 'm going to talk about the process of <unk> .
This is a computer program .
In the cells , it 's going to work in the future , and this is a person who has created this , or a little bit of change , that it will make a difference or some other type of changes , a big change or something that might be a dog or maybe this whale .
If you look at the <unk> of the genome , you 're going to have to think of Chris as the same type of machinery , like Jim <unk> , and each of us .
In order to convince you that this <unk> is true , if you look at the <unk> of the genome and the computer program , it helps you trust this metaphor .
But the best thing for me is that the <unk> of the little changes in the small changes is a huge change in evolution .
A very small <unk> can make a <unk> fly into a wing wing fly .
Or maybe the leg is supposed to live in the place where they should live .
Or if you 're familiar with this film , the little variation in the movie is probably about six <unk> people .
Now , one of the major characteristics of computer programs is that you can have a little change in a small change .
If you have one $ dollar , you just have to put this one out of the <unk> .
So that 's why these little changes make me think of a complex computation process , which is <unk> behind these changes .
So all of these things are encoded in the biology of biology , and biology is also the powerful power of those molecules .
What I want to do is to write some of the potential for the <unk> of technology .
And there 's a lot of people who are involved in this direction , so many of them are doing this , like <unk> <unk> , for example .
They focused on the cells .
It 's a cell expression .
My friend , <unk> programs and I have a method for biology to work with <unk> .
We want to use DNA , <unk> and proteins to create a new kind of language , which we hope that the future can be used in the world .
All of those cells have these machines .
This is a camera .
This is a solar array of solar panels , which is the tilt of these cells , and it 's the cells of the cells , the muscle motors .
I study group research is trying to <unk> all these components from DNA .
We 're not the <unk> of DNA , but DNA is the most cheapest understanding of it , and it 's also appropriate for it to make purpose .
If other molecules become easier to use , like protein , we will use it .
If we succeeded , what would it look like ?
You 're going to sit in front of your computer .
You can design something , like mobile phones , and if you use a high language , you 'll draw this auditorium .
And then you have to have a <unk> , and you 're going to get out of this piece of instructions and then transform it into real molecules , so that molecules can be sent to <unk> and can <unk> these molecules into a seed seed .
And if you give it to this water , it 's going to be a radical process ? It 's a molecule process , and it creates a <unk> .
If I do n't say , I think the process of life is coming from molecules to the molecular computer computer , and then building the computer computers , then then the computers are going to create a new molecule that will create new molecules , so that these new computers will come up with new kinds of molecules and so forth .
If you believe that all of these types , and if you think of life as I think life is all about mechanical scientists , you 're looking at a very important problem .
A important problem is , how do babies know when to stop growth ?
As a molecule , this problem is , you know , your mobile phone , if you know what to survive .
Or do you have a computer program when you stop running .
Or even more specifically , how you know a program will stop .
And of course , there are other kinds of problems .
One of the problems is <unk> <unk> .
And indeed , I think he 's actually a computer scientist .
And he asked , you can start to develop a very small <unk> of <unk> , and how much larger it is .
A few genes ?
And the problem with this question is that , in fact , what I can do is to make a lot of special programs like Microsoft Word .
And when he 's working on the genome , you know , the bacteria will be less likely to make functional functionality , and we can also write a little amount of programming and make it work like Microsoft Word .
But for the molecule , our problem is that we need to put a lot of molecules into the seeds and make it a cell phone .
We need the smallest number of times .
Now , there 's a major problem in computing science .
These are complex questions and computing scientists tell us that these are very difficult questions .
Almost , mostly impossible .
But for some of you , we start trying to answer .
So I 'm going to start asking these questions about DNA structures , and this is what I want to talk about .
In a normal protein , you think it 's normal DNA .
It 's two years , and it 's 55 percent , because there 's a T - ray , T , C.
And I 'm going to tell you what 's going on in this way that DNA is n't scared you .
We just look at one of these two types , not as neutrinos .
When we take it , we 're going to start with the <unk> that we can inflate in a <unk> , and in the other , in another one , to replace this orange thing .
But when you mix them together , they form resilience .
And in the last 10 years , the <unk> and all of his students have been working on research , and he 's going to make a beautiful three - dimensional structure with these DNA <unk> .
Most of them are very glamorous , but they need a long time .
Maybe a couple of years of time , or special design .
So I came up with this new method that I called DNA , which is a very simple technology , and you can do it in your kitchen .
But , for doing this , you need a long <unk> DNA , and it 's hard to get it from technology .
So you can find a natural transit source .
Now you look at this computer simulation of the computer , and he has a very bad genome , and he 's not really bad for the <unk> .
Look at his <unk> , billions of bacteria .
That does n't work .
This is really <unk> , but in the inside , it 's been infected with a very good , long <unk> genome , and we can fold this genome .
Here 's how we do it .
This is part of the genome .
We 've joined DNA structures , and I call these <unk> .
And each one of them has a little bit of <unk> in one place in a place where you 're able to <unk> it in the other place , so that you can change the whole type of structure .
And so many of these are combined with these little DNA and <unk> , and it 's the shape of a kind of <unk> shape - shaped shape .
So far , we could n't make this process , but Harvard Fellow Matthew <unk> made a fabulous visual display at the beginning .
And then we merge them together .
And then <unk> <unk> , and you get rid of the salt and <unk> them down almost down to the process , but it 's going to fall down into the process and start forming structure .
And you can see a little bit about this .
And when you look at DNA , you can see what it is , even if you think it 's a very complex thing , that 's just a little bit of <unk> <unk> , because they 're able to connect with the other ones because of those small crustaceans , and then the rest of the <unk> is connected .
So there are some chains of corn , and a spiral Arduino and then jumping into another spiral .
This can be <unk> into this .
And to show you what we 're going to do , we want to make the shape and patterns that we want to do .
And I want DNA to go into the eye , and go back to the ceiling , come back on the face , get back down the lawn , look like this , like this kind of nonsense of this .
And then I think if you can make this shape , anything else can be done .
And then I came up with the computer program to design a little bit of <unk> .
And I ordered these things , and the federal community arrived .
Put them up , <unk> them down and grab a little less than half a hundred or a half million <unk> .
And every single one of them is a thousand percent .
They 're catching up in the water , and they 're able to see that you need to find a surface that can make these <unk> .
So , you throw them into a surface , and they 're going to zoom in on this surface of the surface .
So the atom has a shot of a needle , and it 's a little bit more <unk> in the surface of a record like a record .
It feels that DNA .
There 's a slight <unk> on the work where you see a little bit about the surface .
And when you zoom in , these <unk> are filled with toes , and some of them are thrown together , they 're <unk> , but it 's good .
You can continue to zoom in and see more and smaller <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
Now the benefit of this technology is anyone can do it .
I came up with something else a year ago , and I had something else called a <unk> .
Anybody know what this is ?
It 's a map of China .
So what happened is , a Chinese student in China , did a good job .
She wrote a program to design and building these DNA , and it 's also a very nice China , but you can see the world 's best <unk> , right ?
So this approach is really good to be able to design , besides shape .
You can do a map of the United States , <unk> the word " DNA . "
And one of the most amazing is that these seem to look like <unk> <unk> , but actually , <unk> art is actually building <unk> motors .
So , you can see the components of the maker , the <unk> , like a <unk> and a light switch .
Let 's put things together , you get a license .
And then you can <unk> the DNA , and it 's just the rest of the police .
This is some kind of work that I did at the California study in California .
They take the DNA , and they <unk> the <unk> of organic <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> switch , looking at it , to see it .
Now it 's just a little bit of a switch , and you need a <unk> that 's going to make the computer , so we have a long way to go .
But this is really a good thing , because these are the ones that are <unk> with ordinary computers , and it 's about 10 .
So this technology is really <unk> to assemble computing .
Now , I want to go back to <unk> .
<unk> can prove that it really works .
So you start doing a job in the computer .
You have a high quality of what the computer program suggests about " <unk> . "
You can send these <unk> molecules and send it to people , and it works .
In fact , there 's a company invented a very good program than my weak program , and this program allows us to do something better .
Now , you understand why DNA is n't a ending .
You have the <unk> of molecules , and you can do anything that you want to do .
The problem is that it ca n't be large .
So if you want to look at DNA from DNA , you have to have a very long number of DNA .
That 's a three - year anniversary of DNA , so we ca n't do that .
We have to use other techniques called <unk> , which are called <unk> .
This technology is invented by this technology that has been invented , and it 's about the length of the DNA cycle .
And if you zoom in , there 's a little bit of DNA that 's there , and it 's very little on top of this little video , if each one of them tends to interact with other modules .
We represent these little square - meter .
And if you look at the <unk> end , these little DNA clips you see , you can see they can form a <unk> pattern .
So these little platforms will be automatically constructed as a complex <unk> pattern .
And the point is that you do n't notice these little platforms that are similar to molecules , and they can come up with a pattern .
One of the most amazing places is that any computer programs can be <unk> like this , and it 's more precise .
You can prepare for some kind of Gothic , and when these industries are put together , it 's not just a <unk> pattern .
You can be <unk> about five , six and seven .
So in order to start doing this , you need to type something into something like a seed .
You can use DNA .
You can get 32 <unk> to the base of the DNA , and then when you get out of those industries , then they start to start , when they read it , they can stop when they read it .
So what we 've done is to find a way to make a molecule that knows when to stop growing .
It knows when it stops , because it predicts it can calculate .
It knows how big it is .
So this is the first question that I 've ever asked .
But it ca n't tell us how to do this .
Now , we can use this approach to make something bigger than DNA .
This is a DNA <unk> , and what we do is we can do it in a number of two years of <unk> .
<unk> is like a <unk> <unk> in a square .
So we 're able to do that with DNA , <unk> and <unk> , which are much more <unk> than DNA .
<unk> , it can continue to write .
By changing the binary matrix , you can get a goat , not swimming .
So in this case , if you keep the DNA size , you can get a <unk> - sized ratio , which is three times bigger .
It 's a simple thing to tell you about growing up .
You have a very sensitive computer program , tiny change , a tiny amount of variation , very small mutations that can create a size - sized , something special to create something .
This is a process that uses computational computing and use this process to build this stuff , and it 's also a problem to care about this .
So , if you ask , how much DNA do you need to build a single square square ?
If we take a 10 or 100 square or 1,000 square square , if we 're only a DNA <unk> , <unk> DNA , we need 100 or 10,000 times a million DNA .
This is really a big number .
But if we do this with a little calculation , we use DNA <unk> , and we 're only going to have a hundred or 200 DNA , 200 or 300 DNA DNA .
And so we 're able to calculate the amount of DNA that 's going to be done by DNA if we use a little calculation .
<unk> is a very efficient way to be able to use the amount of molecules that can be used to create these things as the size of the genome .
And finally , I 'm going back to that kind of thing about computer computers .
I look at this type of <unk> - shaped square - ray of DNA , and it 's a pattern that goes from it . It 's going to depend on the patterns that you need to build .
So if you put some wires out of the tunnel , or the switch switch -- or <unk> them , it 's not the DNA of DNA , and they 're able to self - assemble a little bit of complex circuitry that you need in the <unk> .
So you can use a very complex circuit .
This is the process of a molecule building .
And you might say , well , how far are we going to get ?
From the way , this is what we did last year .
There 's a piece of DNA that 's <unk> from the <unk> , from it .
And you can see how they do it .
One , two , three , four , five , six , nine , 1,000 , productivity , military , prison
It 's false , but at least the size of the <unk> .
In fact , we started with this idea of nine years ago , and this is about the time that it had to be done , I think we have a lot of progress .
We have ideas now to <unk> these mistakes .
And I think in the next five or 10 years , we 're going to do something about the same square or something that I 've described to you .
Now , what do I want you to learn here today ?
I want you to remember that to create a very diverse and complex form of organisms to do this .
And what it does is it uses molecular mechanical form , to understand and better use it , like <unk> said , for understanding things , we have to build a process .
We 're going to use this molecule , re - engineer these sorts of tools that are made from a new way of building each other , using a natural approach to DNA and DNA .
And you know , all of this is great , but I want you to get this molecule from this talk , not just to build some small tools .
It 's not just how to build self - assembly and <unk> mobile phones .
What 's really crucial here is to use computational science and use a new way of looking at these problems , and try to understand how organisms create these amazing things -- and thank you .

Yves <unk> : <unk> <unk>
<unk> made me feel a big job for me last year , and I became a <unk> lawyer .
And since the last 18 months , I was a experience of a lawyer , and I think it 's really important that it really is worth spreading .
So I want to think of it as a result , even though it 's something that 's really important , but I 'm still going to make a lot of bulk .
When the idea of <unk> , they 're going to get the negative images of the public .
Since since 1993 , I had become corporate entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs .
I had a experience of experience , experience and research , and how it was .
I took my two brothers in my <unk> , and my hometown , my home , created the foundation of the <unk> company -- and then the most successful businesses worked in their new businesses , but they worked on their new businesses .
In 2003 , I did n't have pure capitalism , and then I came back to what I call social problems , but I do n't do a lot of <unk> trying to figure out how to overcome social problems .
When the fate and you have a whole range of jokes , I realized that India needed an urgency to the service of service , like the U.S.
And in order to deal with this problem , my four friends , together , created <unk> <unk> , for example , to save the lives of India in India .
The people who come from the developing world , it 's <unk> .
But when we look at it , we 've come up with three main targets : providing the world - raising world service , and if it 's cheaper , they 're <unk> , to all the people who need the service , the price .
And that service is based on the three goals of the <unk> , and in 2004 , there 's only one sacrifice , where there are billions of volunteers in the distribution of three groups , but we 've already awarded hundreds of dollars to the hospital .
This service is -- it does n't require any public funding , but it 's a lot of money to do it , and the rich people are earning more money and poor people who are willing to do it .
And the service of this service has done very well in the <unk> of 77 attacks .
And as you learn from the video , this service goes to a hotel where the police are in the face , and the victims of the <unk> are injured and then they <unk> that damage .
This is the first consumer teams that we 're going to do with this junk , and <unk> the poetry to the hospital to get them alive .
In order to recall the <unk> of the last year , six - year - old corruption , we 've completed a nation - rebel company , <unk> Foundation , funded by <unk> , and Acumen Fund for us .
I just want to use our power to deliver a small information to those <unk> , and in South Asia , in India , India and Pakistan , not <unk> the light , to stop light .
Since then , I worked with them with two social firms .
One is <unk> <unk> for <unk> , which is for the edge of the <unk> School for India .
The other thing is that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the group of groups , is the foundation of the group for <unk> groups .
I think we 're at least doing <unk> .
And because of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , there are hundreds of thousands of dollars to <unk> <unk> per million dollars .
One of the most important is that these are jobs , rather than charity .
And back to the new social company I 'm launching right now .
corruption , authority and <unk> are terrible .
And you might be surprised to announce these words before they talked about those words yesterday .
<unk> and corruption are the ones who are <unk> , and <unk> percent of the people in the supply are often <unk> .
The rest of the need is usually politicians , accidents and those who have <unk> people .
And by the end of the World Bank , there 's 10,000 dollars per year , and it 's certainly not a priority .
And if you 're going to try and analyze a regular <unk> , or she does n't want to go through the room every day and say , " Well , let me see if I 'm going to kill me today . "
Or say , " Look , I can make a difference . "
And this is always a situation that people have to contribute to , but unfortunately , people are doing money for death .
In the current world , time is precious , and it 's a terrible person who is very glamorous to survive in the face of the <unk> .
Now , let me ask you another question .
Imagine you 're asked to pay a discount to you every day .
What do you do ? Of course , you can immediately stop .
What do you do when you get rid of the police department ?
You do n't want to pay that person .
But you do n't have any resources or military guards to fight .
A lot of people in this room , unfortunately , are <unk> by capitalism and markets .
The market of the market is no longer a service that you can call money to donate money and give them to fight .
It 's like a <unk> service , or an eighth - to - fight swimmer -- or <unk> <unk> to fight .
It does n't make any difference .
I was struck by an <unk> , <unk> - <unk> man who had been rejected by the <unk> of the man , frequently in the local city .
She 's only a permission of her ability , she 's <unk> her <unk> <unk> , and it makes her even more <unk> .
But that <unk> does n't want to give the permission if it 's <unk> .
Even this is <unk> , and I ca n't , or say , I do n't want to help her , because I 'm building my own company .
I do n't want to be handed back to Iran .
A group of a group we 've been building a <unk> organization to solve the <unk> of the human mind , or <unk> the problem .
We 're all governed by the <unk> of <unk> tools , like <unk> and <unk> to solve these problems , and we 've managed to achieve the purpose of their purpose .
It 's a huge amount of money to use these tools that are much lower .
And I 'm sure that these tools can be <unk> in a place where you can adapt to the environment , and it 's always the network of the Internet , the <unk> center and <unk> , which means that anything needs to serve .
The goal is <unk> .
It 's been used every year in <unk> , the GDP of India .
And this is an absolutely recent market .
I propose to continue to keep trying to think about the potential to make this service to create this benefit , that it can stop the epidemic and prevent corruption .
And certainly I realized that it would never happen to justice .
It never will be a simple process .
In the last 18 months , as a lawyer , I fought with normal corruption , including the largest company in India .
Because they 've got the <unk> police regime , and I 've been dumped by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> to fight with corruption , our family , friends , people , even children .
But I think the price we pay is to build a better world .
What gave me this sin ?
And as I did , it was impossible when I was going , and this is impossible , but they were <unk> , because they gave up their bright futures . I said , " We ca n't give you , at least not in consciousness .
Because we 're a group of <unk> , trying to do a task that does n't work .
That 's a charming <unk> . Thank you .
Chris Anderson : <unk> , this project is <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah , you do n't want to be a open - up , OK ?
CA : What would you think ?
I mean , can you give us some more intuition , like numbers , for example , how much money do you pay for ?
<unk> : Let me give you an example .
Someone went to the <unk> <unk> .
The staff of the workers <unk> to you 3,000 square meter per pound .
But somebody was <unk> for that guy .
So we have to use " <unk> <unk> , " which is the <unk> of the U.S.
It 's been a <unk> of three examples of <unk> , usually three levels of action .
Some people say , " Oh , what do they do ? I do n't want to go to the surface . "
Some of you are going to say , " Oh , you 've got to do it right ? You know what a horse is . "
And then it 's going to work .
And we have to do the next step , and maybe something else we want , and then each other is <unk> .
The most than three times it did .
CA : And if you 're a 3,000 square meter , it 's a waterborne dollar . How much do you do ?
<unk> : Well , our pricing is less than 200 <unk> .
So it worked .
CA : profit profit . I love !
<unk> : I 'm not going to talk about the stage in the TED stage .
CA : All right , well , these are the digital numbers , really .
Suppose you 've succeeded , you 'll be heroes around the world .
This is very impressive .
Thank you very much to share this project in TED .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> says , " <unk> wisdom as an antidote to <unk> , to save this <unk> social society , and he says the rules often often make us wake up , a lot of social skills that help us <unk> our world .
business , culture , global issues , philosophy , politics , self , social change , society
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : The wisdom of <unk>
In his <unk> talk , Obama called us all the way to <unk> the current <unk> .
But what does he call ?
And so he was very pleased , he did n't have the president Bush , just like the President Bush .
There 's no telling us , " Believe we , America . "
invest , investing , investment . "
Instead , he told us about the dust .
Empathy .
<unk> is a <unk> word .
It does n't look like this in the context of the future .
And some people might wonder , what is virtue ? "
So let me start with an example .
This is a hospital in one of the hospitals in the hospital , and it 's shown in the screen .
This is a very normal thing about this .
This is a bunch of things you might expect : <unk> , clean Aid , <unk> the junk , waiting , wait .
These are some of the things that are quite surprising , but they 're very normal .
But there 's a phenomenon that I want you to notice : Though this list is a long story , but there is no one .
None of them .
It can also be done in a hospital .
And yet , when some psychologists came to interview some of these people , to understand how they think about their work , they meet Michael <unk> , and they 're going to do it , because Mr. <unk> is doing a simple movement , trying to go through the floor , try to get his <unk> to the outside of the building and open it up and walk in the deep and down the ground . "
And <unk> told them that she did n't pick up the <unk> <unk> , without vacuum feathers , because there was some family sitting there . Now , people were sitting there . Now , somebody was waiting .
And they managed to interview twice a little bit about the floor of the <unk> patient 's rooms , because the father of this patient , his dad , he was here for six months , and he did n't see it , so he had n't seen it .
Like this behavior , whether it 's from <unk> , the creator , our nurse , and when we 're lucky enough , it is a doctor , not only to make people feel better , but the behavior of the hospital actually improves the quality of patients .
Of course , social , not every single <unk> .
But the people who do n't think these people are communicating with people , to engage and love , and that 's the central part of this work .
And yet , there 's nothing to do with the rest of the work .
These <unk> have a moral aspiration to others .
In addition , they also have morality to judge what 's right .
Aristotle told us , " <unk> wisdom is a combination of morality and moral skills . "
A clever person knows when to do something special about how to make a special achievement , like these <unk> who know what to serve for people 's service .
You know , a clever person knows how to go to the <unk> , and you know , you know , it 's going to go back to the floor .
The reality of the world is often <unk> and <unk> , and the problems are also evolving .
A clever person , like a <unk> hand , looked at the <unk> , and it 's not going to be glamorous , but it would <unk> to people who had the same relationship between the past .
A clever person knows how to use a moral skill to work .
It 's not a service for other people .
And finally , maybe the most important , a smart person is not born , but it 's constructed .
<unk> depend on experience , but not all experiences .
You need time to understand people 's people .
You need <unk> to do some kind of urgency , trying to make new things , often fail , and that 's from failure .
You also need a smart mentor to guide you .
When you ask people what I mentioned , how hard they are , they 're going to tell you a lot about it .
They do n't say they 're going to take a lot of time to get a lot of time .
It 's about to learn to improve health care .
There 's no limit in the TED Fellows .
It 's a little scary .
The good news is , you do n't need to be a clever man .
The bad news is that if you do n't have intelligence , it 's not enough .
It 's like something else that makes you cry with other people .
Now , I hope we all know that .
And this is obviously obviously , because I 'll tell you a little story .
That 's a story about <unk> .
A dad and a seven - year - old son of his son watched <unk> <unk> .
And the son told him that the father was going to store the temple .
But it 's only about five percent of the caffeine that 's called <unk> .
This dad has no idea of alcohol .
So he bought back .
And this is the beginning of the <unk> , and it 's called a police officer , which is called the police .
And the <unk> was sure that the blood was in the baby .
And then you get the kids left .
But not very quickly .
<unk> kids do n't want kids to be taken down .
This kid was sent to a homeless family , three days .
So that 's all they can go home ?
And of course , Judge <unk> can , but the conditions are leaving his dad to the hotel .
Two weeks later , I was happy to report to you , that family finally ended up calling .
But the <unk> community , the people , and the judges , also said , " We also hate it , but we have to deal with rules . "
How could this happen ?
And the story , in the age of the day , talked about this , and he said , " Well , that 's possible , but they do n't want to think . "
It 's fair to say that the rules often are often <unk> because of the <unk> that they 've got to return back to a child 's home and harm .
The reason is <unk> .
When things are bad , we 're going to use <unk> tools to fix .
The tools are the rules .
More , better principles .
The second tool we 're going to look at is the motivation of motivation .
More , better motivation .
What 's other things ?
I can find it very easily in the <unk> of financial crisis .
<unk> , police <unk> <unk> .
<unk> motivation , to improve cooperative institutions , is improving motivation ...
And the truth is , no matter what the rules are doing , it does n't work like this .
How do you have to write a solution to the ones that I 've told you about what they 're doing before ?
Would you like their sympathy for their compassion ?
It seems ridiculous .
What 's going to happen when we 're more <unk> institutions , the rules , <unk> and incentives , will make things better , but these institutions are <unk> the amount of knowledge that goes down in the long term .
The skill of morality has been devoted to the state of rules that <unk> our opportunity to learn from the <unk> , from <unk> .
It 's also been saved because it 's going to be <unk> by trying to motivate the desire to do the right thing .
You do n't have to think about it , looking for rules and incentives , and we 're going to have a wise war .
Let me give you a few examples of the <unk> of <unk> and morality .
<unk> story is a story .
Secondly , you 'll be familiar with the fact that the United States is now in education : <unk> , <unk> curriculum .
This is an example from the University of Chicago .
Read and <unk> articles from B to B . <unk> : <unk> the students in a little hallway , <unk> <unk> dangerous .
In <unk> , 75 percent of the <unk> is a <unk> page .
In the middle of Chicago , every teacher is in the same way .
We know why you have this kind of stuff .
We ca n't believe the teachers that teachers do n't make them .
Like this kind of <unk> , it 's like <unk> .
They can prevent disaster .
But they 're in place in the place of teachers , that they make <unk> .
CA : Do n't say me . We need rules .
And the hand needs some <unk> , and most of them need to look at the <unk> .
We need more <unk> for bankers , God knows .
But there 's a lot of rules going to allow the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
And eventually , they 're going to lose their talents , or <unk> , and they 're completely <unk> .
So what about motivation ?
They look more smart .
If you have a problem , I 'm going to give you the second reason to make the same thing from logic , two reasons , which seems much better than a reason .
Okay ?
Actually , no .
When there 's one thing , two reasons to be <unk> , rather than <unk> they would n't want to do .
Because I 'm going to get a example of that .
It 's about 15 years ago , and people try to decide where they 're going to die .
This was a <unk> <unk> .
Some of the psychologists around it goes around , and they 're rich citizens <unk> .
And they said , " Can you put it in your community ? "
<unk> , 50 percent of the citizens say it .
They know wildlife .
And they also know that this is going to lower the value of their hand .
But these <unk> have to be on place , and as citizens have a responsibility .
<unk> a little bit later , and asked other people .
And they said , " If we pay you six weeks per year , you 'd like to paste in your community every year ? "
Two reasons . This is my <unk> and I have money .
It does n't look like 50 percent of the time before they say it 's going to happen .
And the second result is to introduce the incentives . So , " What is my responsibility for ? "
And we said , " What is appropriate for us ? "
When it does n't work , when the ancient CEO of the age of <unk> , the long - term health industry has to get a lot of attention to a huge amount of money .
building more <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : You 're impossible to have enough <unk> <unk> .
Any <unk> can be <unk> by <unk> .
We need <unk> . People are always alive .
But for contrast to the <unk> of <unk> , it will allow professional anxiety to look at both sides .
And he would have lost the people who were lost in this event , and it would n't make the event .
Before the <unk> Obama said , " Do we have to ask only about this financial crisis ? "
We can see this in the corporate industry .
" Though not so severe , our best attention to that is that it does n't become a serious fight . "
" To keep the <unk> in the market today , we 're going to do a lot of people who are willing to give you the position of your place . "
So what can we do ?
And here 's some hope : we should try to <unk> the moral meaning .
One solution is , do n't teach a lot of <unk> classes .
I 'm going to show you that you 're not serious about it , and the best way to say to you is to introduce you to one of the things that have a little bit of a moral <unk> .
What else can we do ?
<unk> : The <unk> of morality .
When you go into the <unk> , there 's a very small sound of sound that 's going to tell you about <unk> lawyers .
There are no 10 years to do a mechanism to do it .
People will be inspired by morality .
But we know that when you look at the <unk> , you do n't accept a moral hero and find <unk> .
They were <unk> .
Because you 're proud of them .
<unk> them .
It needs to be all teaching you and celebrate morality .
This is what we can do .
I do n't know how many of you remember this : 15 years ago , another moral hero , <unk> <unk> , who was a photographer , and he was the company <unk> .
It 's 3,000 workers , and he 's brought every one of those people .
Why ? Because if you leave them down , or for the community , this will be <unk> disaster .
" Maybe , we do n't have a lot of money . " But I can tell you , it 's more valuable than imagine , and we 're doing good things .
In TED , we 've heard a few of the moral heroes .
There are two special shocks .
One is <unk> , and he -- you know , he 's a part of the evil artist , or a <unk> business .
Why ? Because this is the correct thing .
A more intimate reward : he 's actually going to make more money .
His employees had been <unk> as well .
Why ? Because they 're happy to do the right things .
Yesterday , we 've heard about the introduction of power in Indonesia .
It 's a perfect example from many ways .
Because it used to be the right thing to do .
And God knows that it can use lots of professions .
And I 'm surprised , and he 's going to have to know how much to make things happen .
But the most important thing is to make it work , and he tends to think about it for a lot of groups .
And unless you work with people who work together , it will fail .
There is no formula , telling you how to support people , because in different groups , different people will use different kinds of life .
There 's a lot of <unk> in the TED clash .
You do n't need to go to the Grand Canyon .
There are many great heroes .
The people who mentioned the <unk> are worth <unk> .
As an apprentice , every one of us should try to be an ordinary hero , and if it 's a remarkable hero .
And as the director of the company , we should try to understand the environment that we need to engage and nurture morality .
Even the most smart people are also singing , if they 're going to get them to <unk> and their work .
If you 're going to take firms , you have to make sure not a job -- no job of job , like the previous job .
Because the truth is , anything you do is the moral work of morality .
Any moral job will depend on the wisdom .
And then the most important thing is , as the teacher , we should try to become a moral hero , become the moral model of our teaching .
A teacher has something to remember .
One is we 're all teaching .
Somebody will always look at it .
The camera is always driving .
Bill Gates celebrates the importance of education , special <unk> <unk> . " Knowledge is power . "
And he talked about a lot of good things that are going to go to university at university .
And I think that one thing that 's going to be done in the <unk> is that Bill did n't speak .
And they found that this is the most important thing that kids need to learn about , is altruism .
They need to learn respect .
They need to learn about respect .
They need to learn their teachers .
And most importantly , they need to learn about liberal learning .
This is a goal .
If you do that , then you 're looking at it close to the bottom .
<unk> : You teach kids to be <unk> every minute per day .
Obama called modern .
I think he 's right .
And I think the virtue that we need is the wisdom of action , because he makes other virtues -- curiosity , kindness , courage and so on .
And he also called the expectations .
That 's right .
I think it 's a reason for hope .
And I think people want to be able to do good things .
From a lot of times , this is the message of TED .
<unk> can be done right , because the reason for that is because of the problem .
And this wisdom is our <unk> , as we start to notice .
Notice what we do , how we 're going to do it , and maybe it 's probably the most important , to build the organization that we work , allowing us to develop wisdom instead of <unk> our wisdom .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : You 've got to stand up there .
<unk> : Thank you very much .

And those who did n't have a surgery at the polling stations of Alabama are not what we can imagine . At TEDMED , Dean Kamen unveils a little bit of a sense of motivation , to invent his impact with his friends .
design , economics , health care , medicine , prosthetics , technology , war
<unk>
Dean Kamen : The story of the invention
I 'm not going to talk about technology , but people and their stories .
On the nearest television show , <unk> <unk> Video : I think many people have seen it .
And what it 's shooting at is the presence of the United States in the States , and he lost a arm in Hong Kong in Vietnam , trying to think that these strange sculptures are not useful .
At the age of this 60 minutes , he was very clear that he had a arm that had taken his arm to the arm , and he did this with two hours a hour to drink it , which was a very , very good thing to do with his own arm . And he said that this was the first time it was coming back .
This is actually not the beginning of the story , and I 'm not ready to show you that little video .
So what I 'm going to show you here is a little early video , because I think that 's how you can understand this story .
A few years ago , the study of police research came to me and found me that these people were funded to develop these kinds of jobs and universities that were n't working on the high - tech technology .
And they 're interested in people who can help people .
Anyway , I came up with this surprising meeting in my room , and I was sitting in the middle of a class and studied the <unk> of <unk> .
And they tell me a story , and the idea is that we use medical technologies that are very advanced , even in the <unk> of Afghanistan or Iraq , the soldiers can benefit from these technologies .
And they 're proud of it , and if there 's a soldier who is injured , these <unk> will be found and bring back and go back to the end of the country and get more <unk> than we 're in the United States .
These are good aspects .
And the bad news is , if they had lost a arm , a leg or a pair of face , he was facing his whole life .
And then they show me the people who lost the <unk> of those arms .
And then the <unk> <unk> said , " In the end of the war of <unk> , if someone lost a arm , we gave him a <unk> .
Now , we have <unk> and <unk> , but if someone had lost a arm , why could we give him a plastic artery ? "
They do n't think that 's true . And so that 's the case .
They want you to do a arm for us . "
I 'm waiting for them to show me that maybe 500 pages of <unk> from the political institutions .
No , he said , " We take a man with one person and give him a <unk> , and he or her , or she can take a <unk> or a leopard .
If you take <unk> , they 're not going to get rid of it . "
Okay , so he needs to <unk> , <unk> and touch .
" If you get <unk> , he 's going to take it very , very upset . "
So , there 's a good motor control associated with the <unk> of <unk> , and the continuation of the smile and the continuation of the shoulder .
And whatever they do is they eat it .
" Oh , yes , Dean , it should be a body body for 50 women , meaning it 's about 32 inches long , and <unk> <unk> .
Fifty percent of women .
This arm should be completely <unk> , including power . "
And they came up with this . I was obviously a <unk> person .
I told them they were mad .
And they 've got to do that .
And then , the <unk> said , " Hello , you should know , over 24 kids .
I ca n't imagine , maybe your imagination is much more rich than I 'm rich , but I do n't think they 're going to lose a arm .
But it does n't have any other arm .
It seemed to be more convenience .
So this evening came home . I started thinking about this .
How do I stop thinking about a person , if not without claws .
So I decided I would do it .
But I did a lot of work in my day .
Most of my work used to be in my face for me , <unk> and <unk> , and so on .
So it 's been a lot of work .
But I think , " I must do this . "
I did some research . I went to Washington , and I told them they were mad , but I decided to do it .
I said I 'm going to give them a <unk> .
I said that this is probably about five years of translation , about 10 years from <unk> <unk> .
It was like the apple used to be launched .
" Okay , he said , " You 've got two years . "
I said , " Well , in a year I 'm going to make a leopard . It 's less than nine pounds .
But I need nine years to make it work . "
We have different opinions .
And then I went back , and I started <unk> the best and ideal of the people that I found .
A year later , we made 14 <unk> of <unk> <unk> . All the sensors , all the <unk> , everything contained inside .
If you 're doing it on top , you 'll find it <unk> , but you ca n't see the interesting part .
And then I 'd like to think that the next might be really practical to make it practical .
But in fact , you can see it from <unk> and attitude , and those are intense people who want to make something good , how powerful they are .
So these two <unk> appeared in <unk> , but one of those two arm does n't die .
There 's no smile on the side , and the other hand is just on the other side .
They did n't have a decade in our offices .
And we did some simple , but it 's good for them .
And I 'm going to show you a little bit about a minute and a few seconds with a couple of seconds or two seconds .
And he took a piece of <unk> , and he had the <unk> <unk> and the milk and his milk , who used all of the joints to put it in the mouth and put it in a mouth .
I ca n't do it .
His wife stood on me .
She was in front of me . She said , " <unk> , <unk> is already 19 years old .
So you have a choice : Let 's stop this arm , and you 're not going to get rid of that arm . "
Now we 're looking at <unk> .
This is <unk> all the joints .
And he 's using the controls of the <unk> , and in his late hand , we have the engineers and the surgeons always get stuck .
This is <unk> , and they 're sending a little <unk> .
And by <unk> <unk> , they 're very proud of it , and they 've got to share a piece of wine .
Not a simple thing .
So imagine how to cook with a leopard , or a pair of <unk> .
Now <unk> is doing a unusual thing , at least for me .
Now , he 's going to do something about what I do .
And he took a leopard , and he did n't have a <unk> . He had n't got it .
Okay , that 's a 15 months later .
But I learned that from Richard , technology , <unk> , sensors , the sensors that are n't important .
I do n't care about these issues , or this whole thing , and I have no interest in it .
I 'm going to tell you some amazing things that we 're starting to do .
We 're sure we 're very good at design , and we need to do all sorts of engineers doing all of these engineers , usually you can pick up three of the things that you want , like the weight of a weight , the size , it 's going to help with the car , which is , in fact , that we 've got to go to the <unk> hospital , to talk to those kids , because that 's what we do .
The <unk> had this arm , too .
And when I said , they 're not very interested in , but I say , " What do they do ? "
The point is only one , the kids will not use this arm .
I told my engineers , " We 're going to go to the <unk> hospital , and you 'll see a lot of people who lose the body important .
These people might be <unk> , depressed , frustrated , frustrated .
So we need to support them and inspire them .
But we 're going to get enough information from them to ensure what we do right now .
And when we walked into the <unk> hospital , I found that wrong .
And we did see a lot of people . There were many people who lost the body , and the rest of the side was lost , there was no <unk> , or a ear .
They 're sitting on a table and talk to us .
We asked them a lot about what we want to know .
" Look , I tell them , " We do n't have a good deal like <unk> .
I can make a good movement for you , or I could make you 40 pounds , but I ca n't do it simultaneously simultaneously .
I can give you a quick <unk> for you , and I 'll be able to force you for your strength , but I ca n't be doing it again .
We try to make them tell us what they need .
And they 're not interested in trying to figure out how to do it .
It can help . "
And you 're listening to me , and it 's much more than that .
And we 're going to help you . We need data , we need to know what you want .
Half a half hours later , there was one person sitting in front of the table .
He lost a arm .
And he <unk> the other hand .
I said , " Hey , you do n't say anything .
If it 's this or , what do you want ? "
And then he said , " You know , I 'm the <unk> in the table .
I lost my legs , but I 'm a beginner . "
So he did n't talk about it .
And he had great spiritual qualities .
And then he did it .
<unk> ended up after all of us .
And then he took himself out of the table .
And he did n't have legs .
And then we left .
And I think we do n't have to support them and encourage them to do this .
And they 're always going to give you also .
It 's amazing .
So we went back .
I started getting harder , fast .
And then we went to <unk> <unk> .
And then we saw a lot of kids like this .
And they were very optimistic about what they were .
And then we went back , and we got back . She was working on jobs .
We started the trials , and we made five <unk> .
We struggle in corn .
And then I got a telephone , and we went to Washington .
And we went back to the <unk> <unk> hospital , and there was a child , 20 years old .
And he was sent to German 24 hours after the German hospital , and they brought him from German clinics .
And then he was there . They said we must .
So I went . They took him into a room .
He had lost his <unk> .
It was lost .
And he was just a little bit of a body on his body .
And his half of his face has never gone , but they said his vision .
He had a eyes .
His name is <unk> .
And then he said , " I need your arm , but I have two . "
You get them .
This kid comes from <unk> .
And then he said , " I have a truck to go there before I went there .
Do you think I could do it again ? "
Of course .
And then I turn to thinking , " What do you do ? "
Anyway , he 's like everybody left .
He really does n't need much .
And he told me , he wants to help . He wanted to go back to help his partner .
So I came here .
I was invited to be invited to Texas .
In <unk> <unk> , there are three million people in this important important thing to help families who have kids in the United States , and the kids , who are dead , have died like the answer . They want me to do a talk .
And I said , " What do I say ?
These are n't good things , if you 're going to give you your arm forever . "
" We need you to come . "
So , I went .
You can imagine that there 's a lot of people who are struggling .
Some of the people who are <unk> are more <unk> .
But every one of these people has incredible emotional attitudes , but only others are concerned about people who have huge effects .
And finally , I want to tell you a little bit about what I 'm worried about .
I do n't mean who is doing this , but there 's a lot of people who are always trying to get them .
And you know , this country has been arguing about health care .
Who has the benefit ?
How many of you have ?
Who cares ?
It 's all hard .
I do n't have the answer to these questions , not all of the people who are born there .
That 's great , but it 's impossible . So let 's do something .
These are all the challenges . There 's a lot of opinions about that .
I do n't know the answer to these questions .
There are other problems .
Are we supposed to be here ?
How do we leave that ?
What do we do ? There are many different answers to these problems , and I do n't have the answer .
The problem for the political Revolution , the Financial institutions .
I do n't know how to answer it . But I have a simple idea , but I can say it .
This is a simple answer .
And I know what these injuries are in the health care system .
And I talked to one of these kids , and he loves this mechanical <unk> because it 's a good thing to do with a plastic bag , but the people in this room are n't willing to use the arm .
But I told the kids , " You know , the first airplane was running 100 feet .
That 's <unk> and <unk> .
But that does n't make the apple .
But we now have <unk> <unk> , <unk> Cooper , even <unk> .
I had never seen a leopard in <unk> .
So I think we 'll have a remarkable outcome . "
And I said to him , " In your commitment to your <unk> , I would stop my job .
I 'm going to do it before , and I do n't stop doing it . "
And I think this country is going to continue to keep it , and also about " I have the power " <unk> . "
Talk about <unk> <unk> .
But we complain about who 's going to spend the money , and how many people we 've got , remember some of the privilege that people complain . I know what they can do .
We should give them .

This is a very rare talk in the TEDMED game , as a magician , and David Brian talks about how he 's going to be underwater <unk> -- -- and there 's no way of doing what it is .

David <unk> : How I do it in 17 minutes
And as a magician , I always try to create a phenomenon that makes people think .
I try to challenge some of the doctors that are not possible .
I was in 1999 , in August of <unk> , a week in New York .
It 's a week to survive .
But it turns out that I got a lot of fun . So I decided to do something more .
Next is me in a big ice ice , and the place in the Arctic is the New York .
It 's much more difficult than I think .
Next , I 'm standing on the top of the <unk> feet , and I 've got eight hours of <unk> .
And so I started very strongly that I was going to have a very strong illusion that my buildings look like a big animal .
And then I went to London .
And in London , I grew up in a glass of <unk> days except nothing except water .
For me , this is one of the most difficult of all , but it 's still a very good one .
There was a lot of people who were <unk> , especially in London , and they sat down in my glass box and sat around with the <unk> around me .
And I 'm really glad to feel a lot of fun in this campaign , actually , in the U.K.
My next <unk> is to try and try to do it , and how long it is , what it means to be , I can live longer .
And I did n't realize that this was the most beautiful journey of my life .
As a young magician , I 'm deeply obsessed with <unk> and <unk> challenges .
And as a child , I started with the rest of the kids , looking at how long it was , when they had to get over the water , it 's about five years , so I could always sit underwater , and I would n't have to go underwater .
When I was a teenager , I could get three or three seconds old .
And then I found that that was <unk> <unk> .
In 1987 , I heard about a story , and a boy died in the corner of the <unk> , the <unk> .
And he did n't breathe .
When the invasion goes to <unk> , he found that he did n't shave .
His heart temperature goes in his head .
As a magician , I believe it might be possible .
I think that if someone could do it , anyone could .
And I started thinking about it , and if this boy could n't breathe , it would have a way to do it .
So I found the best <unk> .
How long is it that you do n't have to breathe , and how long does it go to the air ?
And he tells me that any more than six minutes does n't have the dangerous dangers of the blood pressure .
And so , surely , I have a challenge .
For the first time , I 'm going to simulate the situation that she 's a young man , and it 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And then you climb on that <unk> , and I hope that my body can go down .
When I was 27 years old , I did n't think I could do it for a minute .
So I realized that simplicity does n't work .
I came up with a doctor friend who asked him how I had a headache .

And he said , " David , you 're a magician , design a mistake that does n't make a difference ? "
And he came up with this idea , and he did an e - breathing device , a <unk> <unk> , basically basically a home tube , which he thought could be able to put it in my body and breathed it into a kind of air . He was so <unk> .
It does n't look very comfortable .
But that was a try .
Well , obviously it does n't work .
And then I started thinking about it .
There 's a <unk> chemical <unk> .
<unk> is particularly high , you can use it to breathe .
So I 'm going to try this with this , <unk> it up , put it on the face , trying to breathe . But that 's really easy .
It 's basically a doctor who says , like a elephant , and you still breathe .
It does n't work that way .
And then I thought , well , could it be between my heart and my lungs , and then took the toes of the tubes into the <unk> , the surface , which did n't breathe , but actually these devices were in my blood cord ?
But this is obviously another crazy idea .
And then I came up with one of the most sinister ways : That 's what it is .
And to actually go to the real moment , the doctor thinks that the <unk> will be in the brain .
So I started collecting information .
Because they have four minutes of <unk> in underwater alone .
And when I was doing <unk> , I found that <unk> <unk> -- free diving .
It 's almost impossible to say the most wondrous thing I 've ever found .
There 's plenty of <unk> .
There are deep records that people can get to the maximum <unk> .
There 's also a silver helmet .
That 's how long it is , how much , but you have to get stuck in a static place .
That 's my research research .
The first lesson I learned was that when you 're in the helmet , you should be <unk> , otherwise it 's going to destroy energy .
<unk> oxygen , <unk> made blood pressure into blood vessel , so I do n't try to move .
I learned how to divide my <unk> .
You have to make sure that the rustle and it 's very relaxed to imagine that it does n't work in the body .
And then I went to the <unk> .
It 's actually a <unk> breathing pressure .
<unk> , <unk> .
And then you feel <unk> .
This can be <unk> in the body .
And when you 're <unk> , you feel <unk> .
And then I learned to have a lot of carrot glasses , <unk> , relaxed , do n't make a little glasses and try and relax all the pain .
Every morning , a few months later , I woke up the first thing , and I wake up breathing a breath in 52 minutes .
And I 'm going to use the way that I breathe , the way to breathe , is a minute breathing .
And then you get five to five .
And then you reward it for a minute , and you <unk> the maximum response to the breathing , but again , it takes five years to breathe .
I 'm going to get over and eight times this way .
In the 52 minutes , I actually breathe eight minutes .
I thought the brain was fast .
It was like walking in a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
It seems that I 'm a person who describes the <unk> .
And I started to understand the <unk> of the record .
That 's called <unk> <unk> .
This guy is like a candy .
He has six <unk> , six pounds .
And his <unk> is the average two times .
I 'm six . She 's six , six .
Or you can do it with a smaller bone .
So I had to <unk> 50 <unk> in the last three months .
All of the stuff that comes out of me is as a drug .
Every little bottle of food needs to eat .
And every day I kept eating very <unk> food .
And I started doing good things .
The more that I got , the more you can do it for a long time .
In the <unk> of diet , I went down to 38 times a minute .
It 's less than most of the Olympics .
In four months of training , I have seven minutes long .
I trained all over any place .
attempts at the extreme environment , if you 're going to get rid of the extreme <unk> , you might get a <unk> .
And finally I 'm going to try to get rid of the <unk> , and I 'm going to be in the Grand Canyon .
And the <unk> was eight seconds , Tom , <unk> <unk> , I told you that the guy had a big beer .
I think I can put a big <unk> in <unk> , and I do n't eat that one week , but I 'm sure , slowly , it 's going to be slowly slow down , so I have to do it for a long time breathing .
I was absolutely wrong .
I was a week to go to the center .
It 's all <unk> out .
And what I did n't know is , in <unk> <unk> , the TV was made of people who were very boring , and they were extremely boring .
So I had to add out of the box , and I have to tear it up with the helmet , and they did it .
This is an extraordinary mistake .
And then I had a lot of oxygen in my head .
I 've been <unk> by seven minutes of <unk> .
And after seven seconds , I started <unk> .
Naturally , they have to bring me out of the <unk> .
Yves bears are <unk> .
So the only one can be able to get rid of the smoke , and I can think about it .
And I tell him that I 'm going to increase my risk of adventure .
This is a different record , and this is the <unk> helmet , which is <unk> by <unk> .
That 's the first time that you 're going to take it into the <unk> , the oxygen oxygen , it 's carbon dioxide . And you can do a lot of time .
And I realized that I was real competition -- <unk> .
And in 2008 , <unk> gave me four months to work and train .
I was sleeping every night .
It 's called low - speed <unk> , which is the <unk> season .
Talk about the ultimate <unk> .
And the reason for that is that the number of people in the body are <unk> , helping you save oxygen .
Every morning , the brain comes out from low <unk> .
When I first tried <unk> , I could have 18 minutes .
It 's been really successful .
When the leopard <unk> put me out of the water , it was <unk> -- 15 minutes away , the brain was n't breathing your brain .
But when he took me out , I was good .
There was a guy who was really bad at it .
That 's my <unk> . When I was underwater , she was <unk> all my comments .
My brother took the photo . That was ...
And finally I announced the public challenge .
And what he did was , he was in the <unk> and <unk> show himself to break his records .
And then his main competition is <unk> again .
So it 's been published in 16 seconds .
It 's going to be three minutes ahead of what I do .
You know , much more than ever ever documented .
Now , I 'm going to talk about the fact that the <unk> magazine come to it .
And I hope they 're participating .
So I did anything that had a <unk> scientific journal .
I 'm going to visit everybody from the New York Times to each other .
And I do n't know why it 's a magic trick , and John <unk> , John , who has been convinced that a word for breathing is <unk> breathing .
When he was there , I was trying to expose him .
So I went down to 22 feet , and I had 16 feet tall , so I was in the <unk> process , which was really dangerous . That 's what people do .
And fortunately , <unk> saw me that he took me down .
And I started getting tired of it .
And I 'm completely trained to have the noise of noise , and I do what I need to do .
But it could n't be done by the way that it was going to be <unk> , and it was the show of that <unk> show .
I was practicing , and I sat down in <unk> .
But they wanted me to look at me before , before the audience saw my face .
Another problem is that the leopard <unk> <unk> the <unk> , so they have to use my leg to my feet .
And I had to use my feet for the feet of the foot , and it was a very tough thing to do with me .
Because it caused me very nervous , to improve <unk> .
In addition to each other , they did it since the <unk> , and I was doing a <unk> <unk> .
It 's underneath my <unk> .
So every time , every one of my stops would hear <unk> sounds . You know , that voice is very glamorous .
It <unk> me more nervous .
And I 'm not able to get that <unk> .
And in the same minute , my <unk> is <unk> , and when I breathed it into 12 , it 's very unusual .
This time , it 's about 120 times a minute , not down .
In the last five minutes , I 'm crazy trying to reduce <unk> .
And I was just saying , " I have to get close to it .
I 'm going to fail . I 've failed . "
And I became more nervous .
It 's been <unk> until it 's about 150 times a minute .
It 's exactly the same thing as the center of the London center .
<unk> is eating oxygen .
When I moved to half of my time , I did n't have any success .
I ca n't do it .
And then I thought , I 'm going to make the whole 18 hour to do this underwater note , and if I get older , it becomes a <unk> show that I fail after .
So , I found myself the best thing to do , until at least , that they could start to take me out of it .
And I kept going on for 10 minutes , and I started with this very intense eye and toes of this incredibly intense patient .
And I know that that is blood vessel , and it 's the blood pressure that goes through the bottom of the blood cord .
At the age of 11 minutes , I started feeling a little bit about my leg , and it seemed odd .
At the age of 12 , I started doing <unk> , and the arm started <unk> .
I 'm a depressed patient , and I remember any <unk> that <unk> heart disease .
So I started <unk> .
And at the age of 13 , it could be because of depression .
I felt like the chest <unk> .
There is Yves <unk> .
In the 14 minutes , I have a strong desire , wanting to breathe .
In the 15th minutes , I 've got symptoms of blood pressure .
The heart starts with blood pressure .
<unk> comes from 12 , 50 to 50 , from 150 , 20 , to 150 .
It 's going to swing around .
When you start , <unk> stopped . And I could feel it .
I 'm sure I 'm still sick .
So in the 16 minutes , I put my foot up because I know that if I really want to leave the water , or <unk> heart disease , they 're going to get rid of my feet , and I 'm very nervous . So I 've got a lot of tension .
I <unk> my feet , and I started galloping .
But I did n't get out of the water .
And I just waited , waiting for me to wait , wait .
You know they have <unk> doctors who sit there .
Suddenly , I heard <unk> .
I think it 's a crazy thing to do , like I die .
And I suddenly realized that I went to 16 : 32 !
And each of the viewer gives me the power of my energy and I decided to keep it .
I went to <unk> , 17 seconds .
And even if that was n't enough , I went back to the laboratory , and they had to collect blood vessel samples in the lab while they were able to test them to find them .
Of course I do n't want any doubt .
I created <unk> , and of course , I hope it was <unk> .
This next day I went to New York , and I had a child coming up to me -- I walked out of the " Apple Show -- " and this kid goes , " Hey , David ! "
I said , " How ? "
And he said , " If you could really be underwater <unk> , why do you go from the water ? "
And I said , " What ? "
This is my life . You see ...
As a magician , I tried to show you some things that seemed impossible .
I think magic , no matter whether it 's underwater or a pair of nuts , which is very simple .
That 's exercise , training , and ... it 's practice , trained , to try to do everything that they can do .
That 's the magic for me . Thank you .

The great creativity , when we need to do that , we need great creativity .
Talk about the great ideas , great creative , amazing , <unk> and irrational forces .

The great creativity of creativity can be <unk> to lose the price or say that loss is unnecessary .
The great creativity can be managed to make the politicians , and they can make fun of parties .
It allows the war to become a tragedy , and it makes it <unk> .

It 's allowing us to express the <unk> of a moral moral imperative , " <unk> <unk> . "
Science means smart , but the great creativity is n't glamorous , and we need this magic magic .
It 's now when you need creativity .
Our climate change is fast , rapid fast .
The great creativity needs to be done in the place where it works , to replace it with a lot of creative statements .
And to <unk> us with very popular creative ideas to do different activities .
And there 's this idea here , and it comes from a foundation where I participated in creativity to encourage people to do ecology .

Yves Behar on how to rebuild Afghanistan
" <unk> <unk> , " as long as the American philosopher was a long time ago , through debate and discussing .
If we have <unk> assumptions , avoid <unk> , we need to engage our assumptions .
And that 's exactly what I 'm going to talk about is that this is the critical question that we 're dealing with .
First of all , our assumption is that capitalism has been swept over 150 years of development , democracy .
If we look at the world in 1945 , and see the economic economy of capitalism and democracy , they 're just not the mainstream , not mainstream .
But the current question is that , for example , the capitalism of the <unk> and the <unk> of the democracy .
But we have to admit that we 're going to <unk> the original consensus .
And that provides the foundation of creating a action , because every moment of consensus can be done .
And this is what you have to do , regardless of how we 're vulnerable or short , consensus on us .
But most of the world is not benefiting from capitalism , not from democracy systems .
And most of the countries in the world think that the United States is depression - <unk> as an eye - to - exercise policy , rather than an understanding of morality , rather than <unk> .
In terms of capitalism , it 's about two aspects of the global experience .
First is resource - <unk> .
The <unk> came out , the <unk> of the stone , and it was <unk> , from <unk> wealth .
Secondly is technology protecting .
The technology of technology and what you want to do , but it 's the most powerful form of the world , and it shows the <unk> face for developing countries .
Imagine a few people who are capable of building their capacity to build a regular <unk> per day , and they ca n't stop thinking .
Secondly , of course , I 've had six months of <unk> , and the next eight years of the world reminded us that we 're not living in three different worlds .
It 's a story .
Simple .
We 're not talking about the meaning of the world that we live in .
That means that if we want to have a world , this world is incapable of building a huge <unk> in <unk> , and then some of them are <unk> .
And we 're going to have to think about what a real global world is , and the relationship between the power of power and respect and values .
Otherwise we 're going to lose this historic moment in the history of political and economic change .
What about these three organizations ?
We have three key themes : Financial economies , civic social and state .
And I do n't have the two of the effects that I 'm going to tell you about the level of assumptions from one helicopter to another .
There 's a curriculum in the most elite universities , but it 's almost impossible to say that in my <unk> .
My country is owned by the drug economy and the <unk> .
It does n't work in my <unk> , and I almost did n't have any suggestions .
Our knowledge of knowledge becomes the first foundation of progress , rather than the model of mathematical mathematical models , of course , but it 's also <unk> .
My work in <unk> was the best .
Secondly , do n't worry about the structure of a nation 's structure , where we ca n't simplify it , to talk about a whole range of functions for the 21st century ?
<unk> <unk> and I have written a book that we 're going to be able to have more communication and sharing . Number three , we can actually build a vector , to measure it , and how it works .
So what do you do ?
We 've got 10 examples .
These are the dynamics of <unk> , the <unk> of violence , <unk> control , investing in social investing , to <unk> the infrastructure , by monitoring the structure of the state , through the world , that the market is <unk> -- the public <unk> , the world 's non - <unk> -- and the most important thing is that the laws are <unk> .
I wo n't even have a question .
I want these questions to give me a chance .
This is a very practical goal because I do n't think we know how to deal with it .
Who 's going to think about the German today as a government , or a democracy , if you look from Oxford .
But the people in Oxford who are prepared to be prepared for a professional plan .
There are many other examples .
Now , for doing this , we have to rethink the definition of capital .
One of the most low - <unk> forms is that it 's <unk> capital -- money .
The money that money does n't exist in many developing countries .
It 's just money .
Because it lacks the mechanism , the organizational form of organizing , to <unk> it to the capital .
And what it requires is that physics and conservatives and <unk> are <unk> , and of course , security is essential , the information is .
Now , we should worry about the challenge , and also I hope to give you the challenges that you need to have 16 years to nurture a <unk> .
There was a guy who grew up for 20 years .
The first challenge is to think about the problems of modern art .
Will we need the way we have that ?
Our education system is based on the 19th century .
To fundamentally change a project , what is it that we need , in this economic form ?
Most people in the world are in 20 years , and they 're becoming more and faster .
They need different ways of doing different kinds of ways . Different values .
This is the first one .
Secondly , you 're dealing with the problem , but you do n't have your global responsibility .
You 've got away from terrorists .
You 've got to see clean conditions .
But you do n't have a problem with corruption , who could n't be seen ?
You do n't want to plan for the development .
You 're great designer , but your design is selfish .
It 's just to do it for yourself .
In my world , I 'm working with those <unk> and <unk> , and this design has had six years without being <unk> .
That 's right . It needs us to think about it .
But even more importantly , what we need is that your imagination is a way of dealing with the imagination , and it 's a way to make a difference .
And the role of the model , in a long period of time , Thomas <unk> , his job is the interior of his work , and the new development of the idea of new development emerged in the same place , the new ecology of development , and the whole development of evolution emerged on the outside of a whole period of things , a new growth of developing development ?
And I hope that this organization is capable of handling the problems of government and country , and to give this world a lot of poverty in the world .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : So , <unk> <unk> , until recently , you 've always been in Afghanistan , and this is a country in the world 's dominant center .
This country really can do it .
Can democracy <unk> ? What do you most like ?
<unk> : " <unk> me , I 'm afraid you , you 're <unk> . "
You ask me . You know I always give some <unk> answers .
No . But it 's true that Afghanistan has to be seen as a one at least 10 to 20 years of view .
Today , globalization is accelerating .
It 's been compressed .
It does n't exist for most people .
But in my world , you 've got to know , when I was 23 years later , space had progress .
All the <unk> structures are <unk> .
I was traveling , and I had to spend three hours of cities in the city today .
So , first , when you measure standards , we have to recognize that infrastructure is that simple things are about six years .
In our world .
All of things are meaningful like this .
But what the attention is , what 's going to happen tomorrow ?
Secondly , when a nation has been one of the most widely , <unk> - <unk> powers , we 've got 10 years of <unk> , 110 people who are really scary .
<unk> : Every Afghan will think of the sky as fear .
We 've almost been released by the military .
And then there are thousands of people who are trained by fighting terrorists .
In the United States , the U.K. provides a lot of <unk> organizations to train thousands of people to avoid and against terrorists .
How to make a bike - being tool .
How do you bring a cow , a claws , anything that 's going to be .
And the Russians are the same .
So , when violence is in a country , like Afghanistan , because of that tradition .
But we have to understand that we 're very lucky .
I mean , I ca n't believe how lucky I 'm going to come here and stand in front of you .
When I became an analyst , I thought that I would have a lot of plausibility to the probability that I had to do .
Dangerous , but it 's worth it .
I think that I can do it , and why it 's all people .
You know , because I 'll give you a data .
<unk> men in Afghanistan , <unk> women , hear at least three <unk> channels per day .
I tell you the complexity of the world . I 'm going to say that they have a lot of college <unk> in the United States , because it 's all about it .
And what is the most important fear ?
<unk> .
The Afghan is deeply becoming <unk> .
You know , when I was in 2001 , I did n't want to work with Afghanistan , because I 'm a nation - <unk> .
I told them -- my people , with the American people -- is separate .
Yes , I have a consultant in the United Nations .
I went through 10 years of <unk> in Afghanistan .
Everybody told me that this is a different world .
You know , they 're participating .
And they saw the International Society of the Iran , which is important for those folks .
And what 's normal about the most common Afghan <unk> is <unk> <unk> , so I tell you a little bit about women who have been born with a <unk> in Afghanistan .
And that woman says she does n't care about her ovaries .
She care about the future whether she 's planning , and her children have a different life .
That gives me hope .
CA : How do Afghanistan have a lot of money to raise a whole bunch of people ?
<unk> : Well , first of all , do n't get paid to get rid of the drug , and it 's a lot of money to make money for a group of security companies to go to 50 the world 's most amazing businesses to create a million jobs .
<unk> drugs work .
You see , there 's a fact that <unk> <unk> : The annual revenues of a thousand dollars do n't produce drugs .
Secondly , <unk> .
<unk> is key , not aid .
And the American and Europe should have given us a clue .
The <unk> industry is very dynamic .
If you want us to have the capacity to engage with China and attract investment , we might be able to <unk> 60 billion dollars , if it 's a lot of jobs .
<unk> ca n't relate to the <unk> , but the god can .
And we need to know that this is an <unk> .
Look , a normal Afghanistan has been <unk> by the <unk> .
This is important , for the most important international <unk> for people who are doing <unk> .
They do n't want to sell it to a public charity , and keep the same <unk> over and over again .
We need to work with Italy .
Yes , we have the best <unk> of the world !
Why do n't we do something with Italy ?
How can we distribute systems ?
So I think that the economy , the key to how to think .
I 'm here to talk about money here .
You know , aid systems are bad .
It does n't have just a <unk> .
I am <unk> charity ; I have a lot of time .
And yes , I 'm trying to convince the world to hundreds of millions of dollars to me .
They do n't want to raise us .
CA : But is n't it ?
<unk> : No . No , no .
It 's just one dollar - worth of private investment , I think , in least 20 dollars of aid , it 's the motivation of it .
Secondly , one dollar loan might become 10 cents or 20 dollars , or four dollars .
This is depending on what it means to be , where it is .
You know , aid systems are the entrepreneurs for the reward , not for poverty , rather than poor countries .
This is another assumption : like <unk> , we 've never seen it from government and <unk> .
You might think that the U.S. government is not saying that American companies need to do it in the developing world , providing advice , but they need .
<unk> aid has an historic weight that requires <unk> .
If the goal is to be able to take care of it , they 're fair for their own countries , and I 'm fair to make this proposition , you know , I have to do a very good job for my <unk> -- aid has to stop .
Every year , the <unk> of income and the economy of the country has increased progress .
Now , if you do that , you 're not going to keep the same message .

We 've seen climate change in 50 years ago , but we do n't have the same job . Google / <unk> <unk> said , well , even if there 's something else , it 's going to be in the future , and even even a few other <unk> , <unk> the world .
climate change , culture , global issues , health , productivity , peace

Larry Lessig on psychology
I 'm going to share with you a little bit about the world that we 're looking at , and the challenge of our lives and then I ask us to do what we should do .
And then I 'll tell you a secret , which is why I 'm going to become a <unk> <unk> .
We 're beginning to start with Al Gore , and you 've seen some of you .
All of you have seen " <unk> " , but this is a little bit more uncomfortable .
... this is dangerous .
Because , by the way , we do n't know what happens .
Even today , it 's possible to change the climate change of the Earth , and that 's all from human culture .
Every year , the <unk> and <unk> of the United States combined for 60 years of <unk> , which makes the atmosphere more flow from the sun , and our atmosphere is very glamorous .
Is this bad news ?
In addition to estimate , even surface temperature goes up to heat to <unk> ice cream .
And if that happens , it 's going to fall out of the <unk> of the sea .
And then , when it comes from the bottom of the glass ceiling , it 's going to be able to see the <unk> of Miami in Miami , and the depth of Miami is going to be 150 feet away .
We 're going to have more diversity than ever before .
If you look at this , we 're supposed to be <unk> , or should it feel sad ? 50 years ago , but we do n't do anything ?
This is what you 're looking for .
I thought , at least I would return to <unk> .
And then someone asked you how you 're going to make the next step or the right , or wrong ? The answer is , " You want to think about the poorest people who are most <unk> and ask them to benefit them .
If it is , that 's good . If you 're not , you 're <unk> .
And for people in this room , we 're going to think about the most poorest , most <unk> , <unk> people , our culture , the world and the whole world .
And people who live in the middle of the city are usually the poorest , most <unk> , and maybe it 's going to make us crazy .
But at the same time , we see a very nice picture .
Let 's talk about these two aspects . First , <unk> trend .
Now there are two to three degrees of <unk> .
This will cause sea rise , sea ice rising .
It 's also the largest amount of damage to poor people , and the population is still growing .
Even though we were lucky enough to have the idea of the <unk> of Paul <unk> , it 's about 200 billion people on this decade , and the amount of food on Earth does n't have 200 million people .
And what we consume is so many people , so we 're going to go into the generation , and the population will fly to 65 to 95 percent , that will make the maximum <unk> and most <unk> people become the largest <unk> .
And that 's why they 're in cities .
That 's the last six people who live in cities and <unk> , and this is the first species of human species .
The rural areas are no longer as common as usual as usual .
Yves <unk> on Africa
And there 's the <unk> , the payload , and the water , we 're hard to find a little bit of a small amount of food that we 're going to do about 15 years old .
And again , humans tend to eat meat .
<unk> last year , there was a six - year - old man eating six percent of the wildlife in the bush .
There are only thousands of <unk> of meat in the jungle who have a ton of new structures that they 've never seen before , and we do n't know .
Maybe they 're able to become an <unk> of a new epidemic , and we 're going to have a lot of new diseases that we 're going to live in .
And also , it 's increasing progress .
And most people here are the ones that come up with this growth , but that growth is also a dark aspect of the <unk> and other people , and it 's also the form of people who are connected to people .
And as a result of globalization , this process is going to be a huge amount of winners and more <unk> today than ever before before .
It 's about 40 percent of the price of resources and services .
If you 're in the next 30 years of the world , the population of poverty goes up to 30 billion , what happens ?
For one percent of the people who are going to be the resource of 40 percent , the service is actually not getting richer , but because the rest of the world are getting more poverty .
Last week , Clinton in the TED Prize Prize said , " This is something that does n't happen , not fair , non - <unk> . "
And therefore , <unk> seems to be very glamorous .
Darfur , the challenge of Darfur is a resource of resources .
And last year , China happened to have an average of <unk> average average 14 every day .
Most of them are for safety .
We 're facing unprecedented challenges .
Some of the things about weather , some of them are about people .
And those emerging diseases will make the H5N1 and the Avian <unk> , but it 's a very big world . This is a no - ever - <unk> world .
There 's nothing different about the world that 's happening in the past , and what 's going to happen in this world is by YouTube , you 'll see <unk> and phones on the <unk> .
What 's going to happen ?
For some people , it means that anger is <unk> , religion , religious violence and terrorists .
In other words , it means to be married , ridiculed and <unk> .
But what would this mean for us ?
You see the trend here , we become frustrated , or <unk> ?
Let 's look at the example of <unk> .
First of all , even though human beings are going to stop today , the trend of global warming persists .
You can see that the blue lines are going to be the greenhouse gas of the city , and today it 's completely <unk> in the next decade .
The most conservative estimate is about 20 to 30 inches , but it 's probably the decade .
How does it make a difference ?
So let 's see here , here 's the <unk> .
This is 70 percent of the ice that 's 70 feet for five feet .
Let 's look at the <unk> .
We look at the ice of the climate warming , and the rain ice cap is more <unk> , more and less , in the forest , where the land is n't going to absorb rain , because there will be no rain rain because the water can absorb <unk> rain .
Okay , let 's look at the regions of the southern hemisphere in the southern hemisphere .
I think many of you should be an <unk> .
And we 're going to go down in Florida , and until we look at this , we 'll see what 's going on here : the north ice will continue to increase the ice and the south ice is rising .
Or look at the <unk> of the <unk> .
From <unk> , look at this three - dimensional video .
We 'll find that the surface there will come up to 40 or 40 inches from the Himalayas , and then look at this .
There 's a whole range of <unk> <unk> from <unk> to India and China .
This is the challenge of one of the countries .
If you look around the world , look at the area of the <unk> , and see the population of those <unk> clusters , you see that sea level changes our lives .
It does n't matter whether it 's in sub - Saharan Africa , and it 's in the middle of the sub - Saharan .
We 're very upset .
And that 's not the case of <unk> people .
It 's going to happen in each one of us .
So what happens is that these infectious diseases are n't going to hear that you 've never heard about : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And also , as people do with the animal , we have the same kind of <unk> that we live in .
Can you imagine , 20 years ago , nobody heard <unk> <unk> .
And then we saw the first <unk> case that happened in the East Coast , every year in East Asia .
Did you know that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the South Africa who have n't heard of this virus .
Unfortunately , it 's all just beginning .
In the last 30 years , it 's been the first 30 new <unk> epidemic in animals , and then it goes into the animal .
It 's a very big <unk> .
But we look at optimism .
Good news ? Enough . There is always a challenge .
And look at the list of the Nobel Prize list , and you can understand this .
Do n't we ever meet a liberal truth ? We 're afraid of fear , not acting , but some people -- maybe some of you -- a lot of people are going to build a group like a social responsibility , and it 's a <unk> that you 're talking about , like " The social Social responsibility " and the <unk> , his hope , <unk> and <unk> . His hope is <unk> by the traditional <unk> of the world .
We saw that smallpox disappeared .
We might see that the polio will get divided .
Last year , only 2,000 ones around the world .
And last year , maybe we 're able to see the <unk> <unk> of the world , and there 's only 1.3 million cases on the world .
20 years ago , 98 million people infected this virus .
We also know a bunch of new diseases , and it 's all over the last 30 years , <unk> <unk> .
It 's called " <unk> syndrome . "
It 's a very interesting phenomenon .
And we saw a lot of young people who were infected with this syndrome .
But the way they do money is that their parents never think about it .
They do n't wait to get to the end of the building .
They 're bringing money , resources , jobs and jobs , things that make the world better .
You can say , no other thing can be done with you .
There 's also a movement that 's going to happen in the ' 60s , which is that I grew up in the ' 80s .
We think that ourselves are part of a better world , and we think a more good world is to create a world without <unk> , violence and depression .
So today , we 've seen another movement . The purpose of the campaign is saving Earth .
It 's just the beginning .
And five weeks ago , from one of the leading active people in <unk> , came together to stop the <unk> <unk> of <unk> coal , because that electric machinery would destroy environment .
Six months ago , it was a very large <unk> of active active users in California , which was the most important principle of the environment .
Al Gore plays in <unk>
Can you imagine that ?
We saw science and religion , because they saw climate warming , which was incredible in a few years .
There 's now about 40 <unk> across the world .
This is also worth optimistic .
In the 20 years of the Mississippi , the 20th century is a great breakthrough , which allows us to see the <unk> of the horizon .
Four <unk> of action will be the way that the United States is going to have thousands of active people in the US to protect the laws of climate change .
I learned that seven days later , there 's a <unk> Earth in the world .
You could n't even feel that the air is <unk> in the atmosphere .
But all of this does n't mean that they understood a little bit about climate change , which is the largest <unk> of poverty and <unk> .
This is all saying that people are taking the first step , and it 's to travel for itself .
But I 've also seen a bunch of big foundations , like <unk> , Rockefeller Foundation , <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- and the Google Foundation started to understand a little bit about the world , and we ca n't believe in the way that we can not stop global warming , because it 's the most powerful result of what we 're going to do for the rest of the poor .
But for me , I have some reason to make a sense of optimism .
And you 've heard about a lot of fun here , and I heard many of you last night , I want to share my story .
I 'm not born in <unk> .
And I was born in <unk> in St. <unk> , who had a very clever person , and he brought me into the <unk> of Maine and told me , my job is to get rid of smallpox , and it does n't have these projects that they 're going to get out of this project , but there 's no project .
Today , we 've got this purpose , which makes me optimistic , because smallpox was one of the most <unk> diseases ever .
And in the last century , it 's about five billion people , because of the deaths of smallpox , the number of deaths deaths over the world are higher than any other epidemic .
In 1967 , two million people died of smallpox .
Naturally , smallpox was a great job .
You read " The Bible , " you read a little bit about the <unk> , and you should know what it is .
The bottom line is because it died .
In order to kill smallpox , we launched the largest force in the United Nations .
We went to the <unk> in India , and I asked , if you have some <unk> smallpox , there was a couple of people who had been dumped every month , and they had two years .
And that 's what we 're going to have to get into a factor of eradication , which is , as a social entrepreneur , is to come up with the final <unk> of how to do it .
And when we 're approaching the eradication of smallpox , it <unk> why the town is released , they 're going to come and find jobs .
And unfortunately , they found out in a place where smallpox was killing smallpox , and went back to the home , waiting to die .
<unk> brings the virus to another group of other countries that makes it possible .
We have to start again .
But we finally won , finally , the last piece of smallpox : This girl , her name is <unk> <unk> , and she 's living in front of her life , when she passes through the first <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> the sun on the ground , which means that the most terrible viral record shows the Earth .
Do you hear that story , right ?
And this virus is <unk> thousands of people in India , and there are many people who are lying on the virus .
For us , most importantly we built a connection .
From 30 to 30 countries , the doctors , different cultures , sorts of doctors and <unk> , and medical care , health care professionals , are n't working on the <unk> of the infrastructure , and we 're not just talking about <unk> .
Do n't you accept you ?
Thank you .
<unk>
In a quarter of the art , math <unk> came up with a recent theme in 1984 , which he talked about -- extreme extreme complexity and quantum mathematics can not recognize the complex pattern .

<unk> <unk> : <unk> art and fragility
Thank you very much .
I sat down . I was old .
What I 'm going to talk about is a little bit weird in a sense because it 's old .
<unk> is part of the human life . The ancient artist wrote it .
It 's very <unk> . In some sense , it seems extremely complex , a chaotic , chaotic and chaotic .
There are many different sorts of chaos .
So , actually , it was completely <unk> , and I had this complexity of complexity in the years that I found -- I 've found that -- it 's very clear that the slope of this is , I have to say -- chaotic filters .
I want to show you some examples of a couple of examples .
I like to say that <unk> is not " <unk> , " because it 's a lot of people who are like a young Latin Africa , which is " rule . "
No .
The rules are <unk> , because the world is extremely crude .
So let me show you a couple of things .
Some of you are engineered .
Another thing is really real .
This is real , this is a <unk> .
Why do I show a <unk> , a very normal and old vegetable ?
Because although it 's old , it is very complex , but it 's very simple .
If you want to call it the weight , of course , it 's easy , when you eat it , you care about weight . But suppose you 're trying to measure it .
So , very interesting .
If you take a pair of glasses on the list , you look at it , and you notice it 's going to see a leopard <unk> , just <unk> .
And then you get to <unk> , and you 're going to die , you 've got to say , well , you get a little <unk> .
There is a certain kind of shape in the experience of human experience , and every single part of the world is that the whole part is smaller .
Now , what do we do ?
Very large .
What I actually do is I study this problem , and I found it really amazing .
We can measure the <unk> with a number of numbers , <unk> , <unk> , even number number .
And one day , I was a friend of mine , and he brought a picture , said , " How much of this curve is ? "
I said , " Okay , little and less . "
It 's <unk> .
That does n't work .
I look at these things very long .
These numbers represent the <unk> of the surface .
And I said that this is completely non - wired .
It 's a computer . The only input is a number . That number is <unk> .
The <unk> on the left is encoded from many landscapes .
On the right , I 've done more <unk> .
And the eyes are very good at the top of the two .
Human beings have to understand <unk> measurements .
This is very crude , it 's a bit smooth , this is very smooth .
Very few things are very smooth .
So , if you want to ask : How much of a single surface is there ?
So you 've measured over and over again .
The more accurate thing to measure is that the amount of <unk> , the more , is very , very small .
So what 's the amount of ice that 's over there ?
The more you measure , the odds are the results .
The concept of the shoreline seems to be the natural idea of nature , in many cases , but in fact , it 's totally wrong . There 's no reason .
You have to think about it .
How good do you know ?
And what 's amazing about it is that it 's <unk> .
First , artificial landscape -- I 've invented it in the film .
We look at the opposite side .
They might be the mountains , maybe just a formula .
It 's really easy to do .
It 's been very glamorous , but now nothing .
Now look at this , this is a real lung .
It 's a strange thing .
If you take it on the hand , you know it 's very small .
And the size of the lung is very small , but it 's the size of the lung ?
That 's a lot of fun .
Some people say that a normal male is equivalent to the size of a <unk> .
Some people say , yes , five <unk> .
Not very much .
Why ? Because the size of the ice is very <unk> .
And the pilot , the windows , and the branches of branches , they stop <unk> , not because of the rules , but because of the physics .
If you have a big lungs , it 's made out of the <unk> , and what happens ?
So what 's the benefit ?
And so it 's amazing to be surprised , to get people excited about the structures of the lung .
I think my math , <unk> <unk> , helps a life - to - peer surgeon , and there 's a whole bunch of these structures , and there 's no GPS , but it does n't have the geometry .
So I found myself , in other words , for this kind of non - geometry structure .
And a surprising aspect of this is that this geometry often is generous .
Your equations are so long .
You take a number of times .
Sometimes it takes a time to repeat the same thing again .
And finally , you 'll get something like that .
<unk> <unk> is completely full , 100 percent .
Okay , <unk> .
The only part of the natural world is a digital , <unk> <unk> , from nature .
And the complexity of this <unk> is so complex , so that you should have a simple rule .
This simple rules is not a single explanation .
The <unk> Sea has to think about it .
I do n't know how many of these images are , they 're old .
I was very interested in studying them , but then my attention came to other phenomena .
This is another interesting thing .
One of the things that happened was that there was nothing to do about it , which happened about 130 years ago .
The mathematician started creating shape .
It 's a little bit uneasy , even in some way , because humans can invent nature .
<unk> , humans can invent the curve .
The curve is curve , and the plane is the airplane .
Oh , they <unk> .
A man named <unk> <unk> describes this curve , and it became a very interesting thing .
It 's very important , but it 's more interesting because it leads to the <unk> of the mathematics and the laws of physics and simplicity from the human mind .
So , I 'm very sorry to say that pure human brain actually saw something else .
So here I 'm going to tell you a little bit about the <unk> curve .
So it 's a story .
That 's a very mathematical moment in <unk> to <unk> in the world .
And at the end of the mathematics , I was a child and a student , which was an example of things -- the object , and I totally pulled them off with him .
I 'm going to describe some of the aspects of natural complexity .
So , in 1945 , a guy named <unk> <unk> introduced a number , and this digital figures was a mathematical joke . I found this number is a good measure .
When I first introduced it to my math , they said , " Stop . That 's only one one . "
I 'm actually not stupid .
Big <unk> <unk> understood it .
The interior is the algae .
He did n't know math ; it was n't mathematical .
He 's Japanese ; he does n't touch the West .
But his paintings had <unk> faces .
I talked about this can be a lot of time .
<unk> is also <unk> .
I read the book that Dr. <unk> wrote about his book . He understood what happened to me .
This is a <unk> maker .
One day , I decided to <unk> my career in my professional career , and I was trying to test myself .
How do I find a few dramatic discoveries in each person ?
And so I looked at these things called <unk> , and it just goes back .
And I 'm playing it for a while , and I 'll put it back .
And I said to my <unk> , " I do n't see anything . Can you draw it ? "
So he painted it , which means he 's going to be in the heart , and he says , " Well , it 's -- " Stop ! Get away . Stop .
I saw , this is a island . "
It 's amazing .
So <unk> , it 's going to be two or two .
I measured it , <unk> .
Again .
<unk> measurements , large <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : How do you prove it ?
My friend was 20 years old .
These three people have got an incomplete .
And they went together , and they found this quote .
So they 've got a mathematical award , and it 's one of three mathematical consultants , to reward people to see others , but people ca n't prove it .
And you always ask me , " How do you start ?
What makes you crazy ? "
What makes me <unk> as a mechanical engineer , a mathematician , and so on ?
So , very funny , I actually started studying the price of <unk> .
So I proposed this theory and I wrote about it , <unk> prices .
What you see in the left is the long - term data .
In the streets , you see a very , very <unk> theory .
It 's very easy , you can write a lot of books about it .
There are thousands of writing about it .
Now , compare it to the actual price of the real price .
What 's the price of that ?
These curves include the actual price <unk> and my <unk> .
The idea is that people have to be able to -- how do you say that ?
That 's a great job for 50 years .
In 50 years , people are a little bit harder , because they can do it easily .
But I did n't know , I 've heard me .
These two curves are <unk> . The standard <unk> , the blue , and the red one is <unk> the standard five - <unk> <unk> of the time .
<unk> is <unk> . So all the price research is always going to put them up .
" Oh , <unk> .
You do n't have a good <unk> .
<unk> . " In this picture , five <unk> is equally important .
In other words , <unk> should not be put on the side .
That 's what 's called the meat .
And if you do that , you have the price . If you ca n't get rid of it , then you can do a little bit of noise . But it does n't matter .
So , this is the curve .
Now , I talked about the last thing I called my name .
It 's a story of my life .
My childhood was in the middle of the war .
Because I think I might be in one day or a week or one week .
After the war , I met my uncles .
My uncle is a very famous mathematician , and he told me , " You see , there 's a problem , I 've got 25 years without dealing with people .
This is a guy named Doug Engelbart and <unk> .
If you can have anything new , you 're going to get your business . "
Very simple .
So I looked at the <unk> of tens of thousands of people , and I did n't find anything .
And then we came up with the computer . I decided to study computers instead of new mathematical problems -- for example , this is a new problem -- it 's based on old problems .
And I 'm called " <unk> , " which is a little bit of a <unk> in the dictionary , and it 's like a flat surface , where people are supposed to study . This shape comes out .
This shape is very complex .
The equations are hidden there , and it 's going to be released .
It 's very simple , very easy .
It does n't matter .
Now you put it together twice , twice as two magic pops .
I mean this appeared .
I do n't want to explain these things .
This is what it came .
How complex and <unk> , how beautiful shapes .
And this is what happens , and it 's all over , and it 's <unk> .
And so this is a major discovery that I found out of the shape of these islands and the whole shape of the <unk> , and that 's less than that .
So you get these amazing <unk> everywhere .
All this little equation comes from about five signs .
And then this one .
<unk> is because two reasons reason .
First of all , these shapes are so complex that people do n't realize that figures .
If you want them , you have to choose some system .
So my principles is always opening different colors , because some color corresponds to color , some colors .
complex .
In 2008 , I was in Cambridge .
<unk> a prize . Three days later , a pilot came out of flight .
Where did that come from ?
Obviously , from the alien .
So in Cambridge , he 's published an article about this article , and the next day , I 've got 5,000 letters , people say , " That 's just a big <unk> <unk> pattern . "
Okay , let me just end .
And this shape is only one of the leading exercises .
<unk> miracle is the infinite direction of <unk> rules .
Thank you very much .

In <unk> , bio - <unk> <unk> describes a series of stunning <unk> experiments from the <unk> animal . And he <unk> : Is n't it ?
biology , biomechanics , future , genetics , philosophy , science

Paul <unk> : Time to learn
We 're going to talk about <unk> , but that 's not what we 're talking about .
And what I want to talk about is that those are the things that are happening in our scientific , biotech realm , that 's the first time in history , we have the ability to <unk> animals , <unk> animals .
In the history of the Earth , we 've had three times the evolution of evolution .
The first massive recession is that Darwin 's understanding of Darwin .
And that is , you know , the biology of biology is in special biology and special ecology , and these environments live in that environment , to move through these changes , through random selection , to further <unk> .
And then the human face , by the way , is to create the second - scale evolution of evolution , which is that we change our evolution .
We change biology by creating our biology .
This is the second mass of <unk> , 15 years ago -- evolution trends .
By changing our environment , we have tons of pressure to promote our evolution .
In the experience of the agricultural society , it 's happening to the <unk> social community , and we 've changed our evolution .
Now we 're going to get into the third scale of the world , and the evolution of evolution has a lot of <unk> : consciousness evolution , <unk> evolution -- and we are actually doing a different <unk> and alter corn in our biology .
So I want to take you through a new journey of evolution and then to talk about some of the effects of what we 're going to do with our civilization , and also from this shift .
Now we actually have a lot of time .
We 've got the choice of choice from thousands of years ago .
If you think about the dog as an example , dogs are <unk> creatures .
There are no dog on the planet .
The dog is our <unk> to feed our lives .
But we have to use a very tough way to choose kids who have special characteristics to feed them .
We do n't have to do that in this way .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> and dairy <unk> .
They 're working on them now , and they 're going to be very quickly at the day , maybe you 'll eat <unk> in your local supermarkets .
This is the head <unk> , goats , <unk> .
And they made this cute little scientist , and they ended up eating it .
And I remember they said it turned out like a <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a photographer , <unk> <unk> , for trying to make sure that it 's <unk> and <unk> .
They 're getting used in some of the environments .
This is <unk> .
The largest cats in the world -- lions , tigers .
It 's much bigger than seasons .
This kind of thing , in fact , is actually observed in the wild environment .
But these creatures who made these <unk> used to feed <unk> and gene skills .
And then finally , most of your favorite , <unk> .
There is no change . They 're real creatures .
One of the technologies we 've done is to use genes , or genetic modification , for the gene , to feed the progress of genes .
And if that 's all of that , it 's a funny thing .
But some more powerful things are happening .
And the same gene that comes out of the <unk> , from the deep sea jellyfish , has combined since the surface of the sea jellyfish .
We all know some of the ocean <unk> .
Well , they 've already taken this gene now , and it 's the gene gene that flows into the animal kingdom .
This is normal cells .
What you see here is cells that vary in the dark color .
And when they 're able to use cells , they can also use organisms .
And they put it on the <unk> , and they 're on top .
Yves <unk> presents the orange one because a <unk> gene comes from the coral , and another one from jellyfish .
They used it on pigs .
They made it on the dog .
And indeed , they use it on monkeys .
If you can do it in monkeys -- although from the monkeys to <unk> , it 's a huge amount of <unk> for gene operations -- if they 're able to get it on monkeys , they might think they can make it work on human beings .
In other words , it 's possible to create a lot of human technologies in a long period of time .
It 's easier to find in night .
In fact , there are many states that you can get out of the biology of biology .
These are perfect . They 're <unk> and <unk> .
These are kind of the gene regulator into the yellow , green , red , and they 're actually in some state .
Another state of state is <unk> .
Nobody knows how to do this kind of creature .
There are no authorities in the government -- <unk> <unk> or food <unk> -- to control the <unk> of genes .
So some states decided to allow them , some state of state decided that they would n't want to stop them .
Some of you might know that food drugs are <unk> for gene <unk> .
The <unk> on top of it is <unk> by gene <unk> , using this kind of gene , the gene that we eat , and we 're going to eat it faster .
And now food <unk> made the final decision for whether you can eat this fish -- that fish will be sold .
At the moment you 're worried about it , most of the food that you 've bought in the United States , and most of the food that you 've bought in the country are already <unk> out .
So even if you worry about it , we 've allowed it to go into this country -- it does n't have any <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> reports .
These are the ones that are all the first ones .
In the next step , the first stage is <unk> , first <unk> -- a museum of happiness in the museum , which is an election , and it 's only a <unk> <unk> ; it just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> cats ; he 's just going to have <unk> dogs , because he does n't have a dog , but he has to <unk> by the same scientist , who had no idea of <unk> .
He actually is the first <unk> dog , and it 's a very tough job , because the gene of dogs are very powerful .
This is the town <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's an <unk> <unk> in Italy , <unk> the world , because a lot of the important players are <unk> .
In other words , let them become <unk> structures that are moved beyond .
But if you could <unk> these signs , you can also have the markings of <unk> penguin , and it 's unique to it to make it the next generation .
These are <unk> <unk> , the first <unk> of <unk> . And then finally , first of all the <unk> : [ <unk> ] Speed , <unk> -- <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> or <unk> .
And secondly , we 're starting to save <unk> species .
Now there 's also a role to the animal to create medicine from the body , and what we want to do .
This goat has <unk> -- this goat had been <unk> by gene <unk> , so it actually made the <unk> gene of <unk> gene .
And then <unk> pigs , the pigs of the <unk> Foundation , from South Korea , actually , in fact , they 're using these tools to create all kinds of drugs or other industries , and they want these animals to build these things , rather than industrial manufacturing .
These two creatures are created by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is about Asia .
One meat cell , body cells , extract out of a cow , and then she 's pregnant .
Same thing happened in <unk> , and it was a frozen chicken .
It 's in a regular body , and it actually creates a interesting biology problem .
We have two DNA .
We have DNA on our cells that everybody knows that DNA , but we also have the cells in our bodies , and it 's the energy supply of cells .
This DNA comes from <unk> .
So in fact , what we ended up with is not a <unk> cow , but a leopard or a cow who has cattle who have cattle , so there 's no cow DNA , and it has another <unk> DNA .
They 're actually <unk> , not <unk> .
This creates a problem , if we define biology , in the era of biological technology -- a question we do n't know how to fix .
These cute creatures are Asia .
What they do is they put electrodes into the <unk> and the brain , and in the head , it 's a computer tracking display .
Now , using <unk> , they can bring this creature into the lab and push them down to the bottom or to on the right .
They 've made a insect machine , or <unk> .
It could be better than this , or maybe it 's better than this .
This is a very important fact to the fact that beekeepers are a great deal -- the military is <unk> , and the project is <unk> .
These are the ones that have antennae on the wing .
And there 's one of these <unk> , and they 're able to fly around the lab around the lab .
They can make it on the left , to the right , they can stop it .
They could n't make them land .
They land on the ground to the outside , and then they closed all the equipment back and they get out of it .
But this is the nearest height of their land .
In fact , this technology has been so developed that this organism -- this is a pencil . This is the period of <unk> , and it 's the time that they 've made antennae and computers , so when this <unk> becomes a shot , it is already <unk> .
And the antennae is already in its body , and they 're just going to link it to their technology , they can become <unk> as a <unk> .
They can put a little camera on top of them or a few days to fight .
This is not just insects .
This is a mouse machine , or a machine <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
And again , it contains a problem with technology , electrodes , and there 's a camera in its head .
Scientists can make this creature on the left .
They can travel it into the <unk> , control its <unk> .
They 've created biology .
In <unk> <unk> , said , " Is this moral ?
We stole this animal . "
I 'll tell you a little bit about this .
And this technology uses the monkeys .
This is <unk> <unk> .
And he uses <unk> <unk> to watch their brain , and when they move on , especially if they 're exposed to activity .
Computers learn how to do it in different ways .
And then they link it to a prosthetic , as you can see , put arm in another room .
And very quickly , computers learn , by reading monkeys , to control the other room , doing anything in the room .
And then he puts a video monitor on a monkey cage that showed the monkeys , and it 's very fascinating about the monkeys .
A monkey realized what she did , and what did she do .
And then she 's going to move over the end , and then you 'll stop her <unk> and look at the screen to another room , to the other room -- that means that a monkey has a <unk> of three independent <unk> in the world .
And this is not just a <unk> let us use .
This is Thomas <unk> Thomas .
It experimented with two million , and six million pounds of neurons -- these are separate neurons in the chip -- to put them into the chip .
They 're going to be connected to the Web as a whole chip .
And he <unk> this as a railway model to run the mechanical machinery .
Now we have <unk> neurons based on <unk> tissue .
Finally , <unk> <unk> did a <unk> , independent brain brain .
This is the <unk> brain .
It 's alive , and the brain 's brain is filled with electrodes in a part of an organ , linking it to a brain sensor , put it into a <unk> -- and that 's that <unk> , which is the size of that brain , when you turn on the lights , it 's going to move through the light .
It 's <unk> .
Now we have a whole new <unk> brain .
Is it something that is <unk> in this particular way of thinking about it ?
I do n't know , but the truth is that it 's a whole alive brain that we try to keep it alive , and we try to keep it in our command .
So , we 're working on a stage where we can create life .
This is a mouse that 's created by <unk> <unk> .
And he <unk> this mouse , so it 's a little bit less human - <unk> in the gene , in its interior , with <unk> scaffolding , which creates the <unk> of the patient from the mouse .
In the developing phase of <unk> technology , <unk> <unk> exploded .
That 's where we 're in this process .
And finally , a long time ago , <unk> <unk> created a <unk> cell , and he 's a real cells , using DNA , which is a machine that can make <unk> chromosomes in another cell -- and it 's the same cells to replicate the first cell .
In other words , this is one of the world 's history of <unk> , and it does n't have a parent -- it does n't make any sense .
So , " <unk> <unk> proposed " the first <unk> of <unk> and it . "
You might think that life will become something like this .
But actually , this is not the case of the laboratory .
That 's the winner of the <unk> Lab .
This is a DNA <unk> , and there 's a tag on this bottom , T , C.
So we need to ask ourselves some questions .
As the first time we start to design , we can design organisms directly .
We use <unk> force . If we give us a responsibility .
So what do we do ?
Is it possible to create anything that we want to do ?
Can we design lives ?
We will decide whether we 're willing to decide to win and say , " Look , I want a dog .
I want it to be the head of the <unk> , the body body , maybe some wings , and let it <unk> it in darkness . "
Can you create biology to create their metabolism , blood vessel , the blood , and the other currents and other dynamics , to produce the drugs that we need and industrial molecules that can be used ?
Can we create the lives of life , to cause these animals to get rid of the freedom that we 're wearing ?
And then the final final step , when we 've done these technologies , are we going to start with the human body , and that 's what we might use ?
This is happening ; it 's not science .
We do n't just use the animal , and we start using a part of the body .
What we 're talking about is control our own evolution .
We 're starting to design the future of the Earth 's future .
It provides a huge amount of responsibility and not only the question of thinking about this problem and the responsibility for the <unk> of the problem .
It 's also a responsibility for everybody 's responsibility because it comes to the future where organisms live in this planet .
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> thinks that different colors are just about the <unk> of our bodies and <unk> radiation , and Charles Darwin had a different point of view , but she thinks it 's because he does n't have a American help .

<unk> <unk> invests for color
What 's interesting is that Charles / Darwin -- Darwin is a very , very glamorous person who has been surrounded by a world of dark colors .
In his lifetime , Darwin loves a lot of privilege .
His <unk> are rich .
His parents gave him a lot of support and care .
At the age of <unk> , he took off a little <unk> .
At that stage , he saw a lot of unusual things : plants , animals , humans , human beings .
And he looked at the <unk> of the beautiful community , and he ended up with his greatest book -- " species origin , " published 150 years ago .
And the interesting thing about this book , even though it 's a little bit of a <unk> , is the evolution of <unk> and human evolution .
" Human origin and history have become <unk> . "
At the beginning of a long period of time , Darwin really started to engage in human issues and talk about it .
From the small <unk> experience , with a lot of stories from the <unk> and <unk> , it 's one of the most important differences to the color of his skin , and that 's a major difference between the skin .
And he 's also interested in the importance of the skin .
And he knows that the people who live in the equator are often living on his equator , and it 's always a lot of human beings that are used to live in the middle of a lot of people 's lives .
So what does this mean ?
And indeed , he 's in the <unk> of the species .
But a few years later , in <unk> , he finally came up with his own idea .
One of the most <unk> ideas is , he says , " The difference between people is most important to people , and the color is <unk> . "
And then he said , " The difference between these dark colors and the difference is no connection . "
And he 's really <unk> the world .
You see the people who are different from different colors .
It does n't think that human skin and climate change is relevant .
And if Darwin has been good enough today .
If Darwin had a lot of good , it would be more good .
One of the wonderful things about NASA is that it 's created all sorts of things that are made out of all kinds of satellites , which is the interesting thing that we 're doing .
And in the last decades , there 's been a series of <unk> satellites that are introduced faster to collect the surface of the Earth .
This is the year of the <unk> of seven 70 , 70 percent of the Earth 's orbit .
These <unk> and the red areas are the largest areas in the world , the most large region of <unk> radiation .
And those are very young colors : Blue , green , yellow , always show the area of a little bit of <unk> radiation .
And what 's interesting about the study of human skin is that most of the regions in the northern hemisphere are focused on these fantastic gray areas .
This is something that has a profound impact on the evolution of human organs .
And Darwin does n't realize that , or not knowing , it 's the intensity of <unk> and the color of the body , the skin color in nature .
The dark color is the product of evolution .
So when we look at the brain of human beings , what we see is a beautiful <unk> of color , and we 're seeing this beautiful color that comes from the equator and comes up with the best color of the iceberg .
It 's very , very important to be the most early <unk> of human evolution , in Africa .
We called it " <unk> , " which is <unk> color .
We 're all <unk> of this amazing phenomenon , which is the most primitive , in two million years , with the <unk> skin .
But what happened ?
Let 's first see the relationship between the <unk> radiation and the Earth .
In human early evolution -- notice the equator -- we have a lot of <unk> radiation .
One of the most energy <unk> is that <unk> , it 's been buried in our atmosphere .
But there 's also no excuse to do that , but it 's not <unk> .
One of them is really important .
It 's full of conservatives , but at the same time , it also <unk> the production of the skin D D , <unk> D is the one that we need very strongly to help us , helped us strong , to increase the immune system , and other things are very important .
So in the equator , we 've got a lot of <unk> radiation , and <unk> -- we 're the beauty of our skin and our ancient <unk> , the ancient nature of the old nature .
And the amazing thing about this piece is that it 's in a lot of organisms .
It 's probably possible to have a billion years of <unk> on Earth , and once a process of evolution .
And since it 's so useful , why do n't you change anything ?
So at the beginning of the human age , especially for the first time in our first history of evolution in Africa .
It protects our bodies without destroying the destruction of the DNA , erosion of DNA and destruction , and <unk> the structure of cells and the manufacturing system .
So <unk> is really quite nice . And so we evolved a fabulous <unk> <unk> .
But then we started extending .
People started <unk> -- it was twice , but twice .
From home to home from our equator , from Africa , we start to move through large areas of the area , and the nearest step is exploring .
So what do they do when humans spread into other situations ?
The <unk> of the environment becomes extremely cold , and the intensity of a lot of <unk> is also <unk> .
So you can see that the changes in the northern hemisphere can look at it .
We 're still going to accept that .
But all of the <unk> are just going to absorb the atmosphere of the atmosphere .
In winter , when you 're shooting at <unk> , you might feel <unk> radiation .
But those are the ones who are <unk> , and it 's important to be able to build <unk> D.
So the people who live in the northern hemisphere are lost in most of the time .
This evolution has a huge impact on human skin .
And in order to make sure that the health of your health , these extended populations of populations are losing their <unk> .
Natural selection makes evolutionary evolution .
And so we can see that all of the beautiful artifacts of all sorts of <unk> are <unk> color .
And the skin color is not only about the evolution of only 250 , but it 's possible to evolve three times .
Not only in the modern age of our ancient lives -- the <unk> of <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> of evolution to evolution .
That 's a very long time to spread .
And over the last 10 years , the speed of <unk> is more rapid flow .
And here 's the beginning of the past , more important human <unk> .
Notice that these are moving across large distances , and people go from high - speed <unk> areas to lower <unk> , and vice versa .
But not all extension effects are autonomous .
In <unk> and 2003 , 12 million people in <unk> , because the fate of the Atlantic benefited from the area of high - income areas .
And it raises a lot of social phenomena .
But it also has a terrible impact on human health .
So what happens ? We 're all going to move .
We 're so clever that it 's a very clever <unk> of biology .
Unfortunately , we often do n't know that our skin has always been <unk> by <unk> that we live longer .
Some of the people who live in the dark are living in high - scale areas .
Some of the people in the dark matter live in low - <unk> areas .
This is all a profound impact on our health .
For people who have been careful , we have to be careful about the problem of <unk> <unk> , and the loss of <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> and doctors tell us that we need to protect our skin .
But they do n't have a lot of problems for people who live in the middle of a high - long age or long - lasting , long - lived <unk> .
And the problem that they 're faced with is the same serious problem , but it 's more <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> D <unk> is a major problem .
The lack of <unk> D is affecting the bones of the bone of human body , which is the beginning of a whole range of problems , and the <unk> of immune , or <unk> , is a <unk> health .
So what <unk> did is that one of the beautiful consequences of evolution in evolution and today is still affecting us .
The consequences of social effects are very , very profound .
We live in the dark side of the world , and the population of dark color and dark colors live together , but it has always been done since <unk> .
So how do we get to overcome this ?
How do we start understanding this ?
Evolution can help us .
And Darwin had twice 200 years , and we had the first <unk> , elected elected American presidency .
How fabulous .
And what 's significant about this is that it 's all important .
But we still need to think about it , and look at the difference between his skin and the Earth 's population .
And he 's one of the most <unk> people in the city , and it 's good to be a parent , a tribal form of <unk> .
And he was very surprised to have people who were very similar to people in Africa , like the population of Africa .
These people are easy to be <unk> , and once they 're exposed to sunlight , their skin can generate more <unk> .
They also have the dangers of <unk> D , especially when they 're <unk> , like him .
So let 's <unk> him with health , and also hope that he has a profound understanding of his skin .
And the most amazing thing about human skin is that the best part of the human race is , this is what we 're talking about about selection and evolution .
So when people ask you , " What evolution evidence ? "
You do n't have to have the case of the <unk> or the fossil record .
You can just look at your skin .
And I think , Darwin can appreciate what you do , even though it 's in his era , he <unk> the influence of the human skin .
But I think , if he could see the evidence of all of us today .
And he could be able to appreciate this .
And the most important thing is , he would teach .
You can teach this .
You feel it .
You understand it .
Put it on this room .
Take your skin with your color <unk> .
It 's an information .
Part of the evolutionary history of our race was written in you .
Understanding it is . It 's <unk> it .
<unk> : Yeah , it 's good . How good it is !
You 're a product of evolution .
Thank you .
<unk>
Over the years , research research shows a truth to the opposite of human intuition : sometimes , there 's a lot of choices that are much more happy , but even in choice , it 's also a fun study , which explains why they 're going to give us a sense of <unk> , and that might be the best of people who want to get us to <unk> the <unk> .
business , cancer , choice
<unk>
<unk> : Sometimes , it 's good sometimes for you to drive .
I want my latest portrait of <unk> .
In 2007 , it was five years ago , my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer .
Now , when you think about it , it 's not just the most powerful <unk> of the hospital -- the <unk> , my wife experience .
It was n't the first fear , when she learned about it , she had breast cancer , and she did n't have this disease .
<unk> experience in the experience of experience and pain , and what we need to do is to confront a <unk> and have a decision that needs to be done .
What do you need to do ? Are you doing a <unk> surgery ?
Is it because B is a breast B , so should you try to make a more radical approach ?
How about those side effects ?
Or do you need to do a little bit of a <unk> approach ?
These are the questions we have in our <unk> .
So you might ask , why do doctors do that ?
Some people would say , doctors do this , and they want to protect themselves from the law .
I think it 's a bit of a dust .
These are good doctors , and some of them are really good at the patient .
And they 're just following a long - term response , which is that when you 're doing decisions like this , especially a lot of important decisions , the best thing is to put everything in the <unk> , like sitting in front of a <unk> .
And we 're sitting on " <unk> , " and let me tell you , if you 've experienced the same thing , you 're going to feel very <unk> and <unk> .
And that bothers me .
And I think , if you should , <unk> a definition of the <unk> , " <unk> " , is going to push all of you on the hand , and you have to do it in your hand ?
Or is it a better result when we choose to drive someone in the face ?
For example , a <unk> consultants can become a doctor , and so on .
And since I studied the human race , I decided to do some research , and so I decided to get some information .
I 'm going to share with you today .
Now imagine you 're participating in my research .
And I 'll tell you what you need to do in this research , what you need to eat sandwich .
If you feel a little bit skeptical , I 'll wait for you .
And you 've got a whole range of questions that I 'll give you about .
The more you can answer , you have larger options .
So why do you drink this one cup ?
Why ? Because this is very typical .
Because you 're going to have a better solution to this problem , and if you think about it , your brain is still in two dimensions .
Right ? It needs to be right in the <unk> state , which is good .
And it also needs to be in <unk> .
No anxious , it 's going to help me .
Now <unk> is designed in design , and it 's called " <unk> design . "
And what I want to do is to turn you into two groups .
Imagine the blue here , and the people here are called " A <unk> . "
Now , what I 'm going to do is , I 'll do it for you , which is to give you two cow , and you 'll take you directly with a sandwich sandwich . You chose your <unk> .
You can decide what you 're going to do : OK , I decided to get rid of the caffeine of caffeine , and then I decided to get rid of it .
You 're going to give yourself your decisions , your decisions .
For the people who are people , I 'll give you two cow , but you do n't make decisions .
I 'm going to give you two cow , remember , I 'll give you a random experience for you .
And you know that principle .
So you feel that this is a special case , because in reality , when you sit down in the real world , most of the forces are all you trust , like a cavalry , and so on . So , it 's an extraordinary case .
Now you have to drink <unk> .
Imagine you 're cooking . We 'll wait for you .
We 're waiting for five minutes .
Now you have 30 minutes , 15 problems .
This is an example of your challenge .
Who cares ?
<unk> : Wow .
Okay , so <unk> .
Right , so if you 're right , you are also experts , and we 're going to make a difference with your strategy .
Because we 're trying to make a problem .
These are the problems of <unk> <unk> , because your first response is to say , " Well , you 'll be able to find <unk> and <unk> .
Right ? So these are based on your knowledge .
Because we want it to be challenging , and I 'll tell you why .
And here 's another example .
Anyone ready ? This is <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah , ooh , good . Okay .
Well , this is the same thing .
And you say , " <unk> , and then you 're going to try " " Keep " and try and get out of it .
Now , you have 30 minutes to answer this 15 questions .
And we 're trying to get these problems here , which is the number of questions that come out of the solution , whether you 're going to figure out how many problems , because you can decide that everything is better or better , or your outcomes , the answer to the problem ?
And in a series of studies , we 're together , you , called " passenger <unk> , " although your sandwich is a random bunch of problems .
And we 're also looking at another thing , and it 's a group of people who are not alone , but not in this mission .
No job , no <unk> , etc . .
How do you do that ?
We have two <unk> .
One of the time is that when you 're trying to get the answer to the problem ?
A lot of time - to - peer ratio is less than a Chinese population .
The other thing is , you 've got 30 minutes to answer questions , and you 're the whole thing , or is you going to give up ?
A group of people are even more likely to melt than B .
So , the people who do n't respond to the <unk> , and the answer is that the solution is less .
Now we 're going to think , how do we do that ?
And what is the answer to that , and that 's the result that " <unk> " is a good thing to show .
This is what happens to you .
And that <unk> is what you get to do .
Think about this , and it 's possible that it might happen in the <unk> investment , but it can also appear in medical care -- the result of the timing .
Whether it does n't work , you know what it is .
Right ? Well , the result is negative .
Remember , because this problem is challenging .
So this is actually a bad thing to do .
This will happen in medicine .
For example , in the early <unk> phase , it 's a very negative patty .
Right ? That 's also true for the market .
<unk> markets have been a negative experience .
In these cases , it turns out to be very specific .
There 's no good controversy ; you know whether you 're going to vote for this .
In other words , this <unk> , the negative , you have a happy <unk> .
You need to be responsible for your decisions .
So what do you do ?
You 'll focus on your next year .
And you say , you know what ? I need to choose the other one sandwich .
And this allows you to get your own choices , reduce your confidence , get rid of the solution when you 're making confidence .
<unk> you do n't accept this task , compared to the number of challenges , and the result is <unk> .
If you look at this , this situation is happening in medical care .
Right ? For example , a patient 's <unk> is <unk> .
It becomes <unk> , and the body does n't work , but it 's always been published . You might n't do it .
So , sometimes you need to confront the <unk> , and the negative , the same , allowing you to make a happy result , which is that you 're sitting in the face of the passenger , " <unk> <unk> . "
I started with depression .
And I want to end with the <unk> of optimism .
There 's been five years since now , and the better news , the good news is , to get a break .
So it 's a very good thing , but I forgot to forget one thing about her early early childhood , and my wife and I decided to sit down .
It 's the beginning of the heart , and it 's hard to think about her <unk> , so we have it today .
We asked the doctors to make all the decisions that we have .
Thank you .

The economists are <unk> -- <unk> von <unk> 's wish to build the first <unk> market in Ethiopia , and her plan is going to influence the risk of the world , to bring the risks to the largest food <unk> that <unk> the world 's largest food <unk> .
Africa , business , economics , food , global issues , technology

Yves <unk> talks about the economy of Ethiopia
<unk> knows that there 's a <unk> tree in the <unk> , on these beautiful mountains , and people decided to do a different thing . That 's the synthesis of happiness , not their GDP .
So why not ?
After all , happiness is not just a little bit of love , but the basic human rights .
So what is happiness ?
Happiness is free .
That 's where it 's going to be where you 're going , what do you get to do , and what to sell , who sells , to feed , how to sell it , how to sell .
Where do you come from ?
Who 's the everyday ? How do we build it ?
One of the ways that you 're chosen is by market .
<unk> markets provide multiple options , and ultimately invites people to be <unk> .
The great Indian economists , <unk> - <unk> , has taken Nobel Prize , because he proved that famine and food does n't work , but the ability to get food , or a person who plays the power of food .
One of the things that happened in 1984 was the largest crime in the world , almost a million people who killed the country in my country , and Ethiopia , Ethiopia .
Not because they did n't have enough food , but in the southern south of the country , there was no food to actually get the food or the <unk> , and there were no rights of food .
This is a point of my life .
And today , most of the poorest Africans are farmers .
And in general , most of the African farmers are doing little farmers in the area of land , and they 're very , very small , but really , there are very few farmers .
Africa is one of the most <unk> countries in Africa today , and that 's even true .
In Africa , there 's only seven percent of the weight of <unk> and Asia , and they have 40 percent .
Every <unk> of farmers in Africa was more than 22 pounds of coal , and they 're <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> density in Asia is about six times the size of the continent .
The research in Latin America is more than eight times higher than Africa .
The little farmers who live in Africa are n't so many choices , so much free .
His lives have been rejected by poverty .
As soon as he was arrested , with less poor crops in the middle of the town , it was the lowest cost of prices , because he did n't choose .
A few months later , she came back to the market , and it was the highest amount of money , which we called the <unk> -- the food -- but because she was going to buy the family .
And the real problem here is that the markets in the African village where Africa is going to develop innovation and entrepreneurial power ? And we know that power is true .
Another famous economist , <unk> <unk> , won the Nobel Prize , because she came up with a lot of malaria , but she was still poor .
That means that , in fact , farmers are <unk> , and as anyone else , they want money .
Now , we do n't need more Nobel Prize to understand that farmers want to get market in the market , and they also want money , as anyone else .
One of the things that is clear : at least we know that Africa is open - minded .
This is the business of the city .
Over the years , the world fought in Africa to say that the market needs to be <unk> , financially .
And that means that government is going to get rid of the business of business , and governments are actually leaving the market .
So what happened to the last 25 years ?
Can Africa be useful ?
Are our farmers becoming social partners ?
And I think we 're all in here , probably because we all know that , in fact , Africa is the only place in the world that 's going to continue to go to the next decade of hunger and Russia , where food is <unk> , and now it 's faster than 20 years ago , there 's no continuum .
Why do n't agriculture behave like what we expect ?
What 's happening in the West is what 's wrong with the Western Revolution ? And I 've taken 15 years of research in <unk> , and it 's been studied by a hundred years from <unk> markets , to try to understand where the market is going to be wrong .
For me , this revolution seems to <unk> the most important thing for me .
And for example , the agricultural market in Africa is extremely glamorous and not inefficient .
And what we learned from our research is that the risk of <unk> in the market , the <unk> of the marketplace and the Arctic , is very high .
In fact , there 's even a third of the <unk> in Africa to get the market to market .
There 's no progress in Africa , not only for the development of the road , as far as <unk> , but because it lacks that lack of markets , things like market information , <unk> and standards , and connections .
And so it 's so much that the goods are always doing a lot of trade in a small range of areas , where people are aware of and trust people .
And so , with corn - consuming corn -- and I 've calculated that from farmers to the farmers , it 's going to require four , five to five . Every time -- I see this happening in the entire village in Africa , and it moves .
And I thought that was strange .
And then the police came to me and said , well , I really understood that it was like this , people knew that they got the amount of goods and quality .
This is actually the amount of <unk> that <unk> , for example , is the ability to <unk> the price of prices and <unk> .
And this is also the cost of a fee to this .
And I calculate the business of the city of <unk> , which is only because there are no levels of scale and standards , and the market news news , so it 's going to go through the time .
And that leads to a very clever <unk> .
For most of the violent farmers of Africa , it 's a group of people who come to market , almost <unk> , a little bit of information , and they do n't believe that their product will have some kind of needs for the next market or the nearest local markets , or they know that the entire market market will not be much better .
We 've seen the risk of risk , the world 's worst <unk> .
In Africa , the small farmers are the first ones to withstand this risk .
In fact , in my view , without any area in history , there are no areas where farmers are going to pay for farmers like Africa , like African farmers who have gone to Africa .
In my opinion , there are no places in the world that are building this risk of risky farmers in Africa today .
In Ethiopia , for example , <unk> changes a year .
This market is <unk> , and it 's not only how much it is to invest in high - cost technologies , which is directly affecting technology , for example , the <unk> of modern seeds and <unk> .
To give you a example of this , the farmers in 2001 -- 70 percent of the cancers in Ethiopia , there are <unk> cities .
And yet , because the market system creates 80 percent of the <unk> <unk> .
It 's made of <unk> farmers who do n't have any profit .
We can <unk> , in 2002 , 30 tons of corn , no longer .
Less than six months of <unk> , seven months from 2002 , Ethiopia came up to a severe food crisis , and the size of a year in the year is the threat of death .
One of the things that happened was that there was a year in ice , and in the past , the last time of <unk> , farmers decided to infiltrate the flow market , not using <unk> .
This is a cruel example of <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> .
But it 's not just happening in Ethiopia , but in the entire world , again , there 's a recession .
I 'm not going to talk about it today not to complain about what it is .
And I 'm here to tell you here , changing it .
This is not the Africa that Africa has been paid to be paid for the rest of the world , not <unk> the <unk> of the other year .
Africa has learned , or it 's still about trying to learn -- despite the progress -- markets do n't build and development .
In the ' 80s , people were very popular in the 1980s , and they talked about the price .
There was a huge amount of books about this , and the major thing about it was to put government into market .
We now realize that the market has to be <unk> , not just by price , but also investing in the right building and the appropriate institutions to create the marketplace .
And when that happens , we know that we can see the <unk> of Africa in Africa , as anything else .
About three years ago , I decided to leave my comfort job , not to do the worst economists of the World Bank in Washington , but back to the place where I was born , the Ethiopia , and the end of Ethiopia .
And why I do this is easy .
By understanding , learning and trying to engage and try to convince people where you 're wrong with civil wars in Africa , I think it 's time for time .
And I 've been inspired recently in Ethiopia recently and leading a very exciting new project , which is building the first <unk> of Ethiopia .
Now the idea of <unk> is not new .
In fact , in <unk> , <unk> - <unk> <unk> and farmers united across the river and <unk> the town , and trying to build a better cure .
And in Chicago , it 's the most famous meme in the world now .
And at the end of Chicago , it 's also why we 're working with our farmers in the same way that our farmers are participating in .
In the <unk> of the United States , the farmers used to bring corn into large rooms , and go to the corner of Chicago .
And once the goods of the bladder , if you do n't have the <unk> , the price suddenly goes off , and farmers are going to sacrifice the most important loss .
And in fact , farmers are even going to get rid of the <unk> , and even more money , it 's going to take a lot of money to the farm to farm .
People need to avoid this intense risk and a significant amount of damage , whereas corn , corn and <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , building the foundation of <unk> .
From here , the greatest innovation of the market comes out , <unk> and <unk> does n't have to come up with a lot of people , and they do n't need to use it , and they can be able to do corn - consuming labor , or a fair cure .
This means that corn consumption can travel through a long distance , or even travel over time -- to do 18 months later .
This is the core of the United States , the central state of agriculture , and also Chicago , from a local town to international markets , <unk> markets .
Now , to look at the <unk> of the past century , we tend to think of goods as the West , the American state of state - state , and the coffee , as you know , is the price of coffee in the southern world , which is , in fact , <unk> <unk> , all of these things that are in southern countries , there 's a group of people who have organized <unk> .
But it 's changing .
And we 're also looking at this thing , and this is based on information technology , which is a transformation in the developed market .
In the last century , you can see the Western <unk> of the West , and it 's the United States , the American world of America , only in the past 20 years .
Similarly , this is in India , and it has a lot of <unk> , for example , with <unk> farmers in the last three years .
This is a reduction from cheap <unk> , and they 're highly connected to the market , to bring them into market .
China in China , three years ago -- which was in Hong Kong , in 2004 , to the second World War II , the second World War II .
Now , in Ethiopia , we 're also designing the first group of Ethiopia goods that are <unk> .
We 're not trying to pretend that Chicago or India is the model of India , but according to the demand of <unk> , it 's the same thing with small farmers .
So , " <unk> is the Grand Canyon of the Ethiopia of Ethiopia .
We 're creating systems that are good for all markets , it 's <unk> , trust , productivity , transparent , <unk> little farmers to deal with the risk that I refer to .
The design of Ethiopia is a design that we put into a distinctive element , and we 've launched the <unk> , or we 're called " <unk> <unk> . "
The fundamental foundation of <unk> is based on the whole ecosystem , enabling market to develop .
This is one of the things that we 've been working on in the last decade of Africa -- that 's what 's called <unk> .
A donor came to the market , and another person who 's going to go ahead and continue to refine the scale or move the range of <unk> and the standards , the other people who are trying to make information and communication , but the other people who are <unk> <unk> .
And the way we decided to do that in Ethiopia is to think about the entire ecosystems that happen to the whole ecosystem or the entire trade .
That means that <unk> will spend a trade system , and it 's going to be a <unk> sound , because we think , this country is n't ready for the whole thing .
But at the same time , we 're going to do something about the world that does n't have any <unk> , and that 's the place where you 're in the village .
And so , farmers and small <unk> can come up with our <unk> centers , and we call the <unk> center . People do n't have to buy computers or to figure out how to do it , or so they just need to look at it .
At the same time , it 's a very important thing to do with this market , and we 're designed to have a little bit of innovation , which is that this <unk> is going to spread around the country .
<unk> , we 're going to run a interior system to make sure that the amount of money can be done in front of the day , so therefore , basically we are building trust and honesty .
Obviously , we 're working with our partners , and when we develop this <unk> of <unk> , our foundation is also the foundation of the <unk> and the laws -- a whole market for the entire market .
So , in fact , our statement is going to take the church back .
What 's really important is that <unk> will spend a market station for farmers in the country , to farmers who are willing to pay attention to the fact that it 's going to work in real time , and by doing things like pump - to - peer technologies , directly with the sun .
And that 's certainly the relationship between farmers and the market .
Farmers that used to think about local , meaning that he or she could only go to the nearest local markets , average , eight and 10 kilometers away , and they did n't know anything about the market , they had no idea what the price of the U.S. markets were in .
And they started thinking about the country , even international markets .
They 're not starting to make the decisions of the commercial market , and they 're making decisions , according to the information .
And they come to market , and they know how much <unk> they get to get .
So all of this has changed farmers .
It will change the way that <unk> <unk> .
It 's going to stop that they 're doing simple , controlled trade - ups , allowing them to think about how to go from the area of gravity to the areas that flow from <unk> .
Can Ethiopia be that way ?
It seems overwhelming .
But this will create new opportunities .
We believe that this foundation needs to have powerful political help , and we 're going to engage with the <unk> and the information of the relationship between <unk> , but the actual laws of <unk> .
We believe that change is <unk> here , and we can do it completely .
<unk> is a market market in Ethiopia , and it 's going to arise in the next eight months .
Our final <unk> in the last century is our president to declare that this is the most important economic recession for the worst economy .
We believe that risk is high , but it will be more high .
<unk> can be a <unk> - <unk> farmer .
The Asian markets in Ethiopia are about two billion dollars .
And we expect to be in the next five years , if Ethiopia could be able to make even 40 , 40 percent of the markets in Asia , but only for 25 percent , the values of the market .
Ethiopia 's agricultural markets in the South Africa are more than 30 -- and actually , in fact , Ethiopia is the second largest corn of corn <unk> .
So , potential we have .
We 've got it .
Our commitment is all .
We think we have the values of success to change farmers 's choices , to expand our agriculture , change Africa .
And so we found that our joy and joy of happiness .
Thank you .

Yves <unk> asks the <unk> of bacteria and a very surprising <unk> -- to <unk> the project of <unk> , and in this case , he 's going to describe this with this bold plan .
Africa , architecture , innovation , biology , design , sustainability , water

<unk> <unk> : Building architecture
It 's a very interesting lesson to participate in this conference , because this is a meetings that has n't been seen , and I 'm going to show you a creative recommendation on the continent .
And this is the size of the Chinese Great Wall , so it 's going to become a really neglected architecture .
But it 's not glamorous , or it is almost impossible to unseen , that is bacteria and <unk> .
Now , as an architect , we 're being rejected by the problem .
But I do n't believe that architecture is a problem .
And that 's why I show you a <unk> , and a answer to a architecture .
This <unk> is <unk> .
And my answer is a shot of a bacterial and an <unk> building , and it will <unk> the whole desert .
In today , sand is an incredible material , and it 's full of beauty .
It 's very simple and complex .
<unk> is violent .
It <unk> <unk> , but it has <unk> glamorous glamorous <unk> .
There are thousands of <unk> in the world .
That 's a climb process .
When rocks had disappeared , <unk> was born .
Some of the founders of <unk> formed the rocks .
As rock Lessig , new <unk> form .
Some of them will be large , and it 's a massive <unk> .
From a certain way , the static mountains became the flow of moving ice .
But the land is dangerous . There 's a reason to explain why .
It 's beyond the surface of a third .
Some of those are <unk> , and everything else is completely covered .
We found that we found <unk> .
This is what this is called " desert . "
This is the closest area of <unk> to <unk> .
And that 's where , in the early days of <unk> and early ' 80s , the drought <unk> three million people to raise food taxes , and let 's have the lives of the food chain , which is about <unk> people .
This kind of disaster is <unk> back .
But it was rarely noticed .
In our increasingly increasing media culture , <unk> is so slow and difficult to report .
It does n't look like the tsunami or the future : Very few kids and <unk> houses .
And yet , <unk> is a major threat to all countries , about 110 countries in the world , and 99 percent of them are affected by it .
It 's a huge threat for tens of thousands of people , especially in Africa and China .
And it 's a problem that we have a lot of people who are human beings from our <unk> diet .
So we 've got climate change .
We 've got drought , high - speed <unk> , food systems , foods , water pollution , famine , threats , purity , war and crisis .
If we do n't look at it , we 're going to wake up on reality .
So what 's going to happen here ?
I tried to try to find the answer to the <unk> state in Nigeria .
This is the ice that moves over the head of a year in the ' 80s .
It 's almost a regular <unk> every day , and they 're going to kill their house .
I 'm in this -- the second one -- and the <unk> <unk> . That 's a little village .
In 1987 they have to get rid of this village because a big dunes is <unk> it .
So , they had a room in the room with a whole village in a room .
This is where they 've been in the village .
It takes about 10 minutes to go on the top of the ceiling , and that 's why they have to stay a safer place .
That 's the expansion of <unk> <unk> .
If you happen to live in the desert , you can almost calculate how much you 're going to get your kids out , and your house and the life , as you know .
Now , diving on top of the sand , we have about three percent of us .
But if we want to stop <unk> , those extreme environments are good .
After four years ago , 23 African countries founded <unk> <unk> .
An amazing project , which was the beginning of the first project that grew up a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in Africa .
If you want to stop the ice switch , you have to make sure that you can stop the <unk> from the ceiling .
And there 's a really good way to do it , which is to use some kind of <unk> .
<unk> or <unk> are bad .
But there 's a problem with the rest of the community , and the people in the area , they <unk> the tree .
Now , besides <unk> , they do n't have to get rid of us .
My favorite rock of what I call the <unk> of three things .
It increase the surface of the sand dune , and it 's filled with the <unk> .
It provides physics for the <unk> of the tree , and it 's also creating a space that creates space .
If people live in the green <unk> , they can help care about these trees , protect them from human and natural forces .
We can find that somewhere in the sand .
We started galloping , and we started <unk> from inside the desert .
It 's almost a little bit like a <unk> building .
And what we need to do is <unk> , and then we <unk> the sand , <unk> our buildings .
We can do it with both hands to help us .
The wind blows the <unk> into our buildings , from our building .
But now , you might ask me how to make a sand ceiling ?
How do we put it together ?
And the answer is , maybe you can use these guys , <unk> <unk> , a kind of mixture of microbial tissue from the wetlands and the <unk> .
And it took a bunch of <unk> , and she could use them to make a <unk> .
And this image from the United States will show us this process .
So what you 're going to do is you <unk> <unk> in a pile of shops , and it starts <unk> the air cycle .
It 's produced by a chemical process , which is a natural wing , and it 's the natural atmosphere , and it 's going to put the spray together .
It 's about 24 hours of <unk> .
I learned this from a professor called <unk> <unk> .
He did this experiment in <unk> minutes .
And in this , I played this crazy scientist 's role to this <unk> in London , trying to try and try it .
So what about the project ?
I do n't look like a economist , but I did a -- I made a little paint -- <unk> <unk> -- looking for a hundred dollars per year .
We 've got to use 60 dollars to buy bacteria , and then you do n't have to spend a lot of money for bacterial oil , which is about 11 dollars per year .
How do we create something like this ?
I 'm going to show you two options .
One of the first ones is to create a balloon that 's filled with bacteria , and then it 's <unk> it with sand and she 's going to say that the bacteria goes into the <unk> , and you can say that it goes into a <unk> .
So for a few years , we <unk> that part of the desert .
The second choice is <unk> .
We put it into the ceiling , and we create a primitive bacteria on the surface .
And then you get rid of the ice ceiling , and it 's a microphone that we 're almost able to create whatever shape we want .
So , we have a way to make the ice into <unk> , to create space in the sand .
But what does it look like ?
Well , my architecture <unk> me some excited , and it 's a kind of <unk> , it looks like this , which is a model .
These are <unk> structures that I built in <unk> .
And I realized that if I put them up like <unk> , they can give me a good space for me , whether it 's <unk> or anything .
Now , part of the range , the structure of these structures is obviously the <unk> of nature . These bacteria are made .
I think it 's really the creation of creation .
There 's a couple of things that are going on here .
We saw that <unk> <unk> came to the desert , and it turned out that if you liked , you could say , " <unk> . "
Some people are worried about this continent that will not be reduced , that bacteria will kill anything .
That was absolutely wrong .
This is a natural process . It 's now in nature . Once we stop to feed bacteria , they will die .
So these are the architecture of the building structures in the desert itself .
Start with <unk> equipment from <unk> .
And it 's possible to lose a third of the world around the world .
It 's almost a period of time in the population of food , which is almost a disaster .
It 's honestly that we 're <unk> the desert .
And if you do n't have anything else , I want to start a discussion .
But if I 'm going to make a wish in TED , I hope it can be constructed , and start building this in the Great Wall , which is very long , but the city of the desert is building the <unk> itself .
It 's not only limited to trees , it 's more connected to all countries .
And finally , I want to show you an animation of this structure and give you a <unk> .
<unk> said , " There 's no building in the rock , anything that 's covered on sand , but we have to make sand as a rock . "
Now , a lot of the details of this project , even further , had political , ethical , moral , economic .
My design -- I 'm going to get you into the <unk> -- very difficult and challenging .
But this is just a beginning .
As <unk> said , this is sand .
I think that 's when I 'm going to make sand . Thank you .

Yves <unk> : Building the blueprint of the <unk>
My name is <unk> -- I 'm a farmer , and it 's a technician .
I was born in <unk> , and I lived in America now .
I started a team called openness ecology .
We found that 50 percent of the most important machines that we think are modern - life -- it 's a vital thing to do .
And then we decided to create an open - source , development - based project , anyone who has a lot of money to build and maintain these machines .
We 're making parts of the global village .
Let me tell you a story .
When I was 20 years old , I found out that I had a useless encounter .
I do n't have any useful skill .
This is the world that I offer for my choice .
I think you might call it the <unk> patterns of the consumer .
So I was building a farm in the <unk> economy .
I bought the <unk> -- and then I did n't feel bad .
I 'm paid to make -- then <unk> .
And I continued to persist .
I know that I need to use the real <unk> of sustainable farms and professions , cheap tools that exist .
I need the tools that are solid , remix , efficient , manage , <unk> , low - cost materials for the local , rather than <unk> .
I found that I could n't create these tools .
So I did .
I 've done testing them .
And then I found that the increase in <unk> could also achieve a smaller machine .
So I published three three design , publishing videos and video methods , and I put it in <unk> .
And then comes from all the people around the world to create samples of new machines .
Now , we 've completed 50 samples of eight samples in the machine .
Now this project is starting to grow independent .
We know that open - source tools are successful on knowledge and creativity .
And also the hardware starts to mature .
We focused on hardware because hardware is affecting people 's lives .
If we could lower agriculture , architecture and manufacturing , we can trigger huge amounts of potential .
It 's not just about developing countries .
Our tools are made of farmers in America , and the <unk> of the American , entrepreneurs and engineers use .
And we found that they were very excited about this , and they could start building companies , the parts of the building , organic <unk> and <unk> the energy of <unk> .
And our goal is to build a public design center , and it 's also the whole thing that makes a good civilization .
I was in a day of a <unk> tree .
And I 've had six months of strike in the day of my day , using six days of the ice that I had on my feet .
And this is just a beginning .
If this idea really is really <unk> , it becomes a profound effect .
The <unk> of the production of <unk> , <unk> ecology , a new culture of culture promises to transcend people .
We 're all exploring using openness to use open hardware technology to create a better world .
Thank you .

In this fiery talk , coral corn shrimp shows the astonishing state of the ocean : barren storm , <unk> , pollution , pets reveal the same thing . <unk> images and data provides <unk> .
fish , green , mission blue , oceans , science
<unk>
<unk> Jackson : How we <unk> the ocean .
I 'm an ecologist , mainly the solid coral .
And my research worked in <unk> , and I went out of the Gulf of ice .
And it 's a lot of fun after that job .
I mean , someone paid you to travel around the Earth 's world 's most beautiful place .
That 's my job .
And then I ended up in <unk> , and the coral reefs are actually the most rare for me in the <unk> <unk> .
And this photo is very interesting , and it shows two things . First of all , it 's white , because you can get so close that you 're going to get very close to it , and it 's the early ' 80s and the ' 70s , which is white and early .
The other thing that it shows is that there are these beautiful corals , <unk> , who ca n't see it .
Ninety - eight percent of the coral reefs in the Bay Area are the most successful researcher in the world , focused on the coral reef .
And we were the best ones .
There were people running from Australia to study our coral reefs , because now we 're running to research their reef .
Scientists are growing in the normal state of coral reefs , and it 's based on the coral reefs .
And then , after 1980 , came up in 1980 .
I moved around with half the labs .
<unk> : <unk> .
It 's about 25 to 50 ft .
<unk> coral reefs disappeared , the new island formed us , and we said , " Oh , we 're very clever .
We know that <unk> is happening . "
We published a newspaper in " The magazine of Science , " which was the first <unk> of the coral reef .
We 've made predictions about the future .
And the reason is that <unk> seals , the last ice <unk> died .
There 's a few months after the ice that died within a few months .
So that 's the same coral , 15 years ago , this coral reefs today today .
There 's also a huge amount of coral reefs associated with large corals and lots of algae and <unk> .
This is exactly the story of the Middle East , and it 's more powerful than the global coral reefs .
This is my <unk> story .
All of us have similar stories of <unk> stories .
Hundreds of these stories are very difficult to <unk> any emotional emotions , because the situation is increasing .
There are more reasons why it 's going to be a <unk> , like a hurricane that has been <unk> over the course of a season , but the situation is overfishing and pollution , pollution and climate change .
So I want to jump and talk about three things .
We hear about the extinct extinction .
It 's hard to imagine that 250 times , some of them tell the world that three <unk> period is for control control .
And <unk> was raised most of the time .
And there 's a winner of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and " <unk> " is " almighty , " which is very dear to the importance of our <unk> and conservatives .
This is a <unk> - and - peer - old ratio in the late 80s .
That 's just the beginning of a series of events that come from a large range of different forms of <unk> , from the <unk> species , where you 're still on the world .
This may n't be easy to understand because you can buy a cheap fish in the U.S.
You should read that tag , look at it from <unk> , but the fish is still very cheap .
This information is hard to <unk> , and I think a interesting way to talk about <unk> is because people love to get out of fishing .
It 's like this .
And what 's shown here is the biggest fish of dead fish people who have spent a lot of money to get out of the boat and get a boat to <unk> , and a place where there 's a big amount of beer in the neighborhood , which is a <unk> of Brazil , so many of them <unk> a whole bunch of <unk> and <unk> -- and it 's the largest thing about the <unk> fish that 's really excited about this fish .
Okay , so that 's the same thing about the theme of the ' 80s .
<unk> fish is the size of the fish .
70 percent of the weight of dead fish is about 250 to 300 pounds per second , and if you want to go out of this , you can almost <unk> a fish .
It tastes very <unk> .
There were less money on the money that people were doing in 1950 , less than <unk> .
That 's all everywhere .
It 's not just fish .
The <unk> seals are two big machines .
We 've spent 20 miles long .
There 's 100 to 200 million <unk> of <unk> .
We use <unk> use of <unk> , and the size of a hundred million pounds goes into a huge amount of ice , which is released from the sea to capture fish .
You can think of it as a <unk> city or a forest , because everything is <unk> .
This habitat is absolutely incredible .
This is a picture of a typical picture showing the state of global warming .
And you can see the <unk> on the bottom , and you 'll see that you 're going to see it once .
There was an ice cream and a coral reef , and it was the <unk> of the fish .
Now the <unk> of the soil has been <unk> from the sea to the Arctic , and the areas that have been silenced by all the forest history of human history .
This is what we 've done in the last 100 to 150 years .
We always think about oil spills or conservatives , and now people are often talking about <unk> .
All of these are <unk> , but the dangerous danger is that it 's a huge amount of change from the whole ecosystem .
I just want to mention two weeks to talk about two <unk> species from the species .
This is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> called " <unk> . "
There 's a whole story about this , and it 's the story .
It 's really <unk> .
And it was completely <unk> from a aquarium of <unk> , which is completely used to the <unk> aquarium .
It 's really beautiful , and it starts with a long - term <unk> of biology , which is <unk> <unk> .
And I do n't know how many of you remember the film " <unk> " -- that 's the plants of <unk> <unk> .
It does n't have a little piece of <unk> , but it 's a crazy growing creature who has been growing almost almost all the ocean .
We have n't found anything about it , and we 're trying to try and find ways to figure out solutions , but that 's what it is .
Now we look at another alternative <unk> from the overdose .
Yves <unk> makes us use artificial <unk>
<unk> : One of the reasons the government is <unk> .
It 's the bottom of the river , and it 's about the plankton - growing cells that grow across the East , the <unk> of the globe .
But since we did all the <unk> and all of these leopard fish fish , they did n't have biology , so they 're not going to die until the natural plankton , which is unprecedented .
And after death , it 's <unk> , and it <unk> it , which means that bacteria will <unk> it .
And in this process , they get rid of all the oxygen in all of these oxygen , and they 're forced to do a completely terrible environment that does n't land completely .
And what we 're going to do is we have a microbes that controls the bacteria , and the jellyfish , you see , in your mailbox .
One of the high - tech businesses in the mirror is a jellyfish fishing , and look at your right - hand ratio and see your right hand , and there 's a <unk> .
Even on the island of <unk> , we 've had a place where there 's a container fishing cannon .
Another way of doing this kind of thing is that we often refer to a lot of the <unk> ice lines , which is <unk> <unk> .
This is a picture of the photo .
I 've talked about it as a lot of times .
On the left , the photo on the right is the image of the <unk> , and the bottom side is a picture of <unk> and Mexico .
What you see here is the entire Gulf of Mexico , and what you saw is that a solid <unk> can kill the fish , which is the beautiful little creature on the bottom right .
In the corner , you can see the black lining <unk> rising to shore .
That 's the same creature .
And when it comes down to shore , the wind in the Arctic goes into the air , and all the hospitals around the atmosphere are in the air .
That 's the weekend in Florida .
I 'm in Hollywood with a friend of mine , and we call it Hollywood - <unk> .
And I said , " Okay , so imagine you 're in a film called " beach " because all of the <unk> <unk> are going to stay in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> to clean their security in <unk> . "
These are all people who do n't have any money on the ground because the islands are no longer heaven . "
This is <unk> .
This is when I was in France last year .
This is <unk> <unk> in the West , the <unk> .
And the reason it makes so much attention is that it 's extremely glamorous than it is , because there 's a little bit of a farmer at the bottom of the sea , and you can imagine that the invasion of <unk> is dead .
There 's a war between farmers and <unk> , and the final result is <unk> in the polar bear .
And of course , climate change we all know about change .
I think the most fundamental picture is that the Arctic ice cap is burning ice cream .
Think about thousands of people who are dying for finding <unk> .
There are Yves <unk> right there .
And I think this is a little bit <unk> , and it 's floating across the coast of the Empire State Building .
The governments around the world are serious .
The military of the Arctic around the country is <unk> about it .
There 's no way of thinking about how many countries have <unk> across the United States and Canada , and so on .
Of course , the Arctic is <unk> .
Other effects of climate change -- this is coral miles . On the right .
So many big coral reefs .
They should be brown .
So what 's going to happen is that the corals are <unk> , some of these tiny algae living inside the interior .
The algae generated the coral reefs for the sun , and consumed by the algae and protect them .
But when the temperature hits the algae , it ca n't make a beer .
And the corals say , " You have a <unk> , you 've got a ticket . "
And so they <unk> them , they die .
It 's not all dead ; some people die . There are more people who survive , but it 's a bad news .
Let me try to make you feel like you 're going to go through the road , and the next morning in Europe or North America , you wake up in the morning -- and you 've found that 80 percent of the trees are already catching light in your head and there 's a <unk> inside of you .
And you go back to home , and you find that North America and Europe are already catching their leaves .
And then a few weeks later you saw it in the newspapers , and by the way , it was dead .
And that 's what happened to the <unk> , in the El Nino of the agricultural phenomenon , and it happened in a area where the city of North America and Europe had died of a coral reef .
But the real fear is that all of these seals , pollution , climate change does n't happen in vacuum - change .
But because there 's something called the positive feedback associated with <unk> , it 's much greater than local sum .
The biggest scientific challenge for people like me thinking , is that we know how to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
I mean , because we still save it .
But what does that mean ?
We do n't know .
So what do you mean in the next 20 or 50 years ?
It does n't have a fish , except for some smaller coat , it 's a dirty tree , all of those things , and so on .
There are <unk> areas of death , and then they start <unk> the T - <unk> , so we can imagine that the <unk> of the world .
You do n't want to eat the fish , because it 's a diet - <unk> game game 54 .
Sometimes you get <unk> , and sometimes you do n't have a <unk> .
There is no market .
But what 's really afraid is that the <unk> of the physics , the chemistry of <unk> and <unk> .
And when the ocean goes into the sea , sea ice becomes more difficult , and the ocean becomes more difficult .
We call it increasingly <unk> .
And it turns out that all of the nutritional fish that are responsible for these big <unk> fish fisheries , California , <unk> , Peru , and other parts of Indonesia and places that I want to do .
At the same time , the surface is <unk> , and the ocean becomes the desert .
So the question is : How do we do that ?
We can do things for all sorts of things , but ultimately , we need <unk> .
This is not a fish ; it 's not pollution ; it 's not change .
Rather than ourselves , our <unk> and our demand for growth and we ca n't imagine a different world that we live today .
The question is : Can we respond to this ?
I 'm going to talk about the future of life and human dignity depends on the way we make reactions .
Thank you .

John Hockenberry spins John Hockenberry through a joke about aliens , medical , time , space methods tell a perfect , perfect <unk> .
entertainment , humor , love , physics , science

John <unk> : <unk> <unk>
You all know that story .
In the summer 2010 , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> psychologist and the micro - <unk> Foundation , and some collaborators , who are hungry , ask them questions : " Where are you going ? "
So , obviously , this is the message that they 're sitting there .
And he had to explain that he was n't talking to them .
He was speaking with space - speaking speaking .
And you see , it 's going to happen in the <unk> of a couple of years of <unk> , in a few years .
And it turns out that nothing , nothing -- it 's just a weather balloon , a floating balloon that 's <unk> the balloon .
And yet , Americans have already been silenced , even in the famous famous scientist .
The <unk> of <unk> , the bad things I 've written , is that the universe is so extraordinary that there is something else that is in the universe .
And the universe is so ancient , unless we 're the first species of evolution , we now have some evidence that there are some evidence in the world .
However , we 're lonely .
" Where are everyone ? " <unk> asked , he ca n't answer his colleagues .
And then I went through this <unk> logic to tell you , and <unk> <unk> , God , the possibility of God -- and then you know , you also know that <unk> is <unk> alone .
Now , I 'm not a scientist .
I never coined the atom .
Now , I 'm probably going to argue , technology 's speaking . Any cuts from atoms .
Anyway , with <unk> , I 'm going to point out that <unk> <unk> may not look at two possibilities .
One is alien , maybe very , very close .
Probably , I 'll say , even on other planets .
Another possibility -- it 's possible that it might be an alien .
Think about it .
And in the world , one of the Japanese scientists , and all of a sudden , had a radical new technology that could change a world . And is n't it so easy to change human history . Is it easy ?
And is n't it a little strange , and he does n't ask any money ?
And he asked only one thing : two health of health ?
And of course , that 's not true .
But it 's pretty weird .
And if <unk> is a aliens , why do n't you try to convince him to persuade him , it does n't exist ?
For the interview or <unk> , they think that the alien is <unk> and <unk> before , and they have the <unk> to live with us , looking at our evolution , to <unk> us from the world -- if you believe that this thing is going to take us into the pyramid and bring us to the back of their <unk> .
This is the opposite theory that nobody believes you can think .
Even in my life , I 'm very difficult to explain -- some of the things that are very , very glamorous , and it 's really amazing , so hard to think about what 's going on in our lifetime , but the relationship that they 're struggling with .
And for other things that you 're going to talk about , I 'm really passionate about it , and I 'm telling you .
One : <unk> <unk> in 1980 .
That 's a summer , and it 's called " <unk> <unk> . "
I went to <unk> with my parents .
I 've been a severe <unk> injury in 12 hours of <unk> , like the art of the film .
So the rest of my <unk> , basically , was sitting in front of a little house , and the sun was walking outside of the night , enjoy the <unk> sun , looking at the sky .
And I 've seen what ? star , satellites , Swiss , <unk> -- <unk> air .
The kids come to me occasionally , and they come up with me to see , their neck immediately is <unk> , so they leave the <unk> and get somebody else playing .
I 've been very good at <unk> , but I do n't really get any better , so I 'm still a man who has spent on the universe .
Here 's what happened here .
One old birthday was on the street .
I think they have <unk> , and they feel they 're in the date , because he 's wearing a yellow <unk> <unk> .
It 's not a night in the late night , and the woman 's wearing a pop - up , <unk> from the surface .
I remember , for example , they 're very high .
And they <unk> , and this man came up to me and asked me , " What are you looking at ? "
And you have to admit , this old man is very similar during the date .
But even funny -- I realized that in that time , as a child , they stopped .
And this old man who stops his girlfriend at a precise question to a child , watching a joke .

And this is his girlfriend .
" <unk> does n't exist , " she said .
" No stuff . "
And they are <unk> .
I bet .
The streets are <unk> .
I ca n't hear the sound of the ocean .
<unk> stop .
I do n't know why they 're starving .
And I looked at their attention , and I felt so weird that they 'd take a rubber mask ?
What 's on the couch ?
Have they had a big , <unk> candy predator ?
What do you do ?
This is a <unk> gesture , and he draws his voice .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> -- " Be careful . "
And then they turn to the end .
And that old man chased his hand into his <unk> , <unk> women , and left me with one person .
Now , you can think of this as a simple <unk> -- a strange <unk> between humans .
Maybe it 's just <unk> , but -- I know what I saw .
Two : In 1984 , the Brooklyn TED Fellows .
I went to see the movie " <unk> ceiling , " and I saw it from the surface -- I realized that it could n't be -- but it was true .
This is <unk> play . Nature .
And I 'm hooked with my friends , and he 's sitting on my left hand .
I 'm asking my question on the right .
She had long , frames hair , blue bars .
And I remember , she was a little bit injury , a little injury and <unk> .
I think she 's extremely high .
I was <unk> <unk> , and I thought she should be the Grand Canyon , but I never saw him . She did n't go to school .
I do n't know what her name is .
She sat with a man like her mother , and they 're talking about fiction .
They 're all <unk> , Mother and girls -- that 's not uncommon .
They 're talking about the most powerful role of the ideal , the big <unk> .
And it 's more <unk> .
And she went to me and asked me , " Do you expect this film ? "
At first , I 'm very embarrassed because I 've never seen novel fiction .
I 'm just one of the movies of a desert star , and it 's now .
But she asked a lot of questions : Nothing really is , as she did n't mind , like she just wanted to talk to me .
I do n't know what to say . I just say , " Yes . "
I do n't even slow down .
The film began .
I do n't need to remind you that the film is David <unk> , in all the role , treaties and <unk> .
There 's a <unk> called " <unk> <unk> , " which is a big pond , and she 's <unk> this huge pond to life -- and he 's going to have his ability to <unk> time and space .
It 's never going to leave the ponds , or anyone in the world .
And he thought , in his world , ugly and sexy are <unk> , he 's going to spread through a kindergarten radio , but never get them .
I mean , I love them against <unk> .
Okay , but you think it 's my diet ?
No .
When you finish the video , everyone 's got rid of the <unk> .
Except a girl .
And when I walked out of her , she did .
Maybe she does n't think it 's like this -- she thinks she wants to do it .
And when I say it 's funny , I can only say that this is a planet that 's a habitable planet , and they call them <unk> - <unk> , " The brain provides a ridiculous , <unk> memory that goes into the pyramid .
I 'm certainly happy , so I do n't have to go to her .
I 'm happy to see her .
Three : 2011 , <unk> .
In the end of the century , <unk> <unk> wrote that Ben <unk> describes the experience of <unk> kidnapping .
There are some strange phenomena , which is called " <unk> <unk> , " and suddenly it 's suddenly realized that he does n't remember anything about 10 years ago , even <unk> , <unk> .
This is what happened when the aliens grabbed his <unk> to him .
This book became the first <unk> book book book ever ever .
This image is made from Ted <unk> , and the images come from a certain point of view .
It 's a very nice movie .
Remember in <unk> , I went to Singapore -- my girlfriend , we decided to look at the movies .
I remember , film shows a lot of detail .
One : <unk> <unk> plays by <unk> .
Two : [ <unk> ] <unk> is the rubber cord .
Three : There 's a very long sequence of <unk> covered with <unk> films to make <unk> <unk> .
Four : <unk> is coming in the <unk> of the city .
<unk> : All of you said , " The movies are <unk> by communication . "
So where did that come ?
A Buddhist event ? What 's the matter ?
Think about it . Yeah . The answer is : did I have a girlfriend ?
How do you do this ? When did it happen ?
And I remember that I went out and suddenly realized that this was true , as we walk down , thinking about the same problem .
Now , I 've never seen it .
Four : <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
A few years later , I talked to this woman , and we 'll call her " <unk> " -- we travel across the east coast .
We live in ancient <unk> of the ancient temple zone , and in small hotel , we 're going to zoom in on the roof , looking at the door of the <unk> and see the <unk> .
What ? What do we do ? Is it ? Anybody will do this ?
We went to the beach .
<unk> ? I 'm not dreaming .
Whether it 's <unk> , we go to Portugal , and this is thought , <unk> .
And I was struck by <unk> , and I ended up with the dog 's dog , my reputation , who I took a long Portugal clinic .
You can make a difference .
In the last day in Portugal , we 're trying to go around the beach to move around to the left .
<unk> is a very nice little city , and she says , she 's going to go through the tent to join the bus .
Will you glide with me ?
I touch it bad , and I said , " I do n't go . "
And I remember the face of her mother 's eyes .
This is a woman who has grown up in her face , and she 's on her face and she 's got a chocolate .
It turns out that our skin is filled with chocolate , right ?
She 's in the eyes of the blue <unk> , and finally .
She laughed .
A <unk> alone goes into a unfamiliar country , and even no sign language , itself travel , travel <unk> and boat , to a boat that does n't know where the beach is .
And I love her , when she comes to the strange scale .
I 've got my thought .
I 've got my " <unk> <unk> , " and I suddenly have a lot of time , realizing it 's going to happen , but she does n't go back .
I feel upset about her .
Now , I 'm not going to die .
I do n't know where the beach is ?
And I did n't call her because it was in 1991 , and there was no reason for that .
And I realized that there were only two consequences of this day : Beatrice came back to the small hotel or she never returned back .
I can only sit down .
I do n't look at the sky , but it 's going to be the end of the street and the <unk> of the street and the little <unk> that are growing forward .
And I look at the dynamics of the planet , and it 's much more promising that they can make me see your face .
And at the moment , in a <unk> million people , I really appreciate the depth of the universe .
People came out of the day .
Five young people -- they 're all happy to come back to their home .
One of them was called <unk> , and he asked me what I did . I explained to him .
And he said , " Do n't worry . " He was certain .
But he does n't agree , because he sat down to me .
The next two hours , they 're waiting for me to wait . They 're going to talk to me about it , and I 'm going to talk to my attention .
Two hours later , they give me <unk> .
We 're not alone .
And this is the beginning of <unk> , and I went around and looked around the street .
<unk> <unk> : She comes back .
She was laughing , she did n't know why I was .
People do n't understand , they have a lot of <unk> . They 're thinking about it , and they 're going to come back to the room , let 's go back .
In the absence of <unk> , it 's been called a doctor 's doctor called " The ' 80s . "
And even now , 15 years later , we get married , and I 've been looking at her , she 's still in room .
And I think you also agree , it 's probably going to be hit at her , <unk> kidnapping , or <unk> , but I will always love her .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
As a consequence of the world , climate change , purity , <unk> , Tim Jackson , brings us to how to stop the financial crisis , and start investing in the future .
development , economics , green , poverty , sustainability
<unk>
Tim Jackson on the talk about economics
I want to tell you a little bit about the <unk> of the hope of our hope .
It 's not just us , but it 's still a long period of people around the world .
I hope that 's really important .
In fact , the CIA 's hope is in <unk> .

And the irony is , despite the fact that we have <unk> from money and economic growth .
But our economy has been so vast , so we 're now on a dangerous situation where it 's a hostile situation -- flying energy energy , <unk> , oil spill , and the only past 20 to 30 years , the last 20 or 30 percent is the economic recession .
The economy , of course , is not a precise <unk> of hope , and we 're trying to find out the <unk> .
So we fell into a trap .
This is a moral dilemma , a growing truth .
We ca n't live with it ; we do n't have it .
<unk> this system or destruction this planet . That 's a hard choice . This is not a choice .
We do n't have the best way to do this , actually , for ourselves , and technology and productivity and more efficient .
Now I 'm not anti - functional .
Sometimes I think we 're smart species .
But I think we should be able to look at numbers and make a reality .
I want you to imagine a world , two billion people in the next two years , all of the Western forms of Western Western life , West Western life .
I want to ask a question -- we 're going to raise two percent of their revenues per year , because we believe that there will be growth .
And I want to ask that question : Are we going to get much faster ?
How clever we need to have ?
How much technology do we need to do in this world ?
And in my image , on the left , there 's the state of what we are .
This is the limit of economic growth and the intensity of the economy .
This is about 30,000 degrees of carbon .
And I 'm going to show you that we have to have the opposite of the right side .
This is a high - speed improvement , and it 's a little bit more <unk> that we have in the industrial history .
We might be able to do that , maybe maybe -- who knows ?
We 're going to do a better form of change from the atmosphere , and that 's exactly what we need in this century .
But we should n't forget our ability to forget whether we 're not going to get rid of it ?
So I want to spend a few minutes on the system to work .
This is some complex , and that 's what I do .
I 'm going to try and do that , and I 'll explain it a little bit .
It looks like this .
There 's a company for family production -- that 's what we 're going to offer for our income , and it 's better , because we can consume these cars more .
This is called an economic cycle .
It looks a little wasteful .
And I just want to emphasize one of the most important qualities of this <unk> , which is the purpose of investment .
Now , investment is only about 40,000 percent of the current economy , but it 's a very important role .
And what it does is it <unk> more consumption .
It 's going to be in a couple of ways -- <unk> , that will be <unk> and encourage us to buy more things .
But I want to focus on the role of investment , looking at innovation , new things and consumption .
Joseph Savage is called " <unk> . "
This is the process of creating new things , to try to improve the health market , the consumer markets , consumer goods , new consumers .
And this is what it is , because it shows the promise of human beings .
We love new things -- no doubt about anything -- but also new ideas , new adventures .
But <unk> matters , because , in every society , it 's been studied by a language , a kind of a form of <unk> languages , an <unk> language language -- we use it to tell each story -- the story , for example , how important we are .
The <unk> of identity , <unk> consumption from this new language .
Now , all of a sudden , we have a <unk> structure that uses social logic -- economic systems and we merge together to grow growth .
And this engine is not just the economic value ; it <unk> its material resources through this <unk> , and in fact , the desire to drive , actually , is really a desire to drive .
Adam <unk> , for the first time , talked to us about the <unk> of life .
<unk> : At his time , it means that <unk> T , today , you still need a T - sharing , but you need to mix the drive , and you have to organize the car , the <unk> , to the computer , for a number of two - year - to - a - half years , which is driven by a lot of <unk> .
Even if we do n't want them , we have to buy them because it 's going to fall apart .
To stop it down to the last 20 or 30 years , we expand currencies , increase the license and the <unk> , to make people sustainable to keep the separation of things .
And of course , these expansion are <unk> .
But -- I just want to show you some data here .
It looks like this , essentially , that these seals and <unk> are just the U.K. .
This is the <unk> , 15 percent of the time . You can see here in here , it 's going to move up here .
It 's over three years of GDP .
Meanwhile , people are <unk> .
These <unk> , the net net , in the late ' 60s , is <unk> .
This is people increase the debt , their consumption , only for the game .
It 's a strange thing to say , more precisely , the story , using a simple term .
This is a story about our story , and people are convinced that we do n't have the money to do something that does n't need to make a fuss about what can not be done .
But before we put ourselves in despair , we might say , " Well , what do we do ? "
Are people like this ?
Is it really this way ? "
Almost immediately , we actually have a lot of <unk> .
The first is economic change .
After the economic recession , what do they want to do ?
They wanted to be <unk> . They want to be in the future .
They want to consume a lot more .
But <unk> is a false point of view from <unk> .
It 's called " <unk> <unk> " -- it 's slow to slow down the economy .
The politicians kept asking us to increase more <unk> , even faster than ours , where we 're able to <unk> the economy , and we can continue to keep this economy .
This is a <unk> , and it 's <unk> and human beings .
So here 's another one -- completely different : why do n't we do what we need to do that we should be doing what 's going to happen to the climate change , and it 's very , very simple to be able to get to change the amount of energy , the high - efficient lights , which is <unk> our house , <unk> us ?
These are things that reduce carbon , <unk> , conserving our money .
But the truth is , though they have perfect economic importance , why do n't we do that ?
I had a few years of my view of this .
That 's a Friday afternoon , Descartes p.m. , in fact , we 're going to move a new home -- we 're moving a new home .
And I ended up trying to do some kind of <unk> , and in the windows and the hull of the window and the window .
My daughter , when I was five years old , helped me with five kids in the age of eight .
And we kept doing a few moments later , and she went to me and said , " This can really hold the mountain ? "

And you can hear how the brain works .
And these , very interesting , in the <unk> of 40 miles north , in the West , outside the <unk> .
And who knows the climate 's climate .
But in fact , the <unk> of the kids could n't get me out , because it made a lot of sure why we ca n't do this clearly .
We 're going to take them to the top of the mountain -- to bring kids to buses in buses , trying to avoid the YouTube email and work in food , looking at food in a few hours , in the <unk> of <unk> , from a couple of hours of television , depending on the high - <unk> television rate , and a night at the end of a day , <unk> <unk> .
What is it ?
" What is the purpose of the consumer ? "
<unk> <unk> was written in a research article about poverty .
" It 's " she said , " went to help make social worlds and find a reliable place . "
That 's a deep human face for our lives , and it is a completely different view of this economy , which is far bigger than that .
So who are we ?
Who are those people ?
We 're the ones who come up with fresh , <unk> , selfish ones ?
Or do we actually have the wonderful <unk> of the <unk> in the harbor , right ?
And this is a <unk> that has one <unk> between the consumer behaviors and altruism .
These <unk> <unk> the roots of evolution , so it 's fair to fight a particular environmental -- fight .
But <unk> is essentially the nature of our evolution .
From our view may be more interesting , it 's another way of looking at things and traditions of new things .
The new thing is that you need to make yourself rethink .
Traditional effects are <unk> for stability and <unk> groups .
So , suddenly , we 're looking at a map of human food .
And that 's suddenly the challenge of this thing .
What we do is we create economic .
We 've created the <unk> , to keep us happy , encouraging the soul of people who are n't paying attention to anybody else .
Similarly , the answer becomes clear because it 's not , therefore , about changing humanity .
It 's not , actually , about openness .
It 's about openness .
It 's about allowing ourselves to call our freedom of our own freedom , <unk> and human soul , to <unk> the fragility of the <unk> .
So what does that mean for the economy ?
What would the economy look like if we look at the understanding of the human mind , and if you look in their minds , they use these human minds ?
It looks like a little bit of a community in the last five years of community service , the rise of the United States in England , and some of them have developed a lot of ecological and social objectives .
I 'll just show you this .
It 's a network focal search engine .
The Internet engine works through sponsors to get money to benefit when you search .
It 's also in the same way .
So here we can do it here . We can type a <unk> .
Okay , Oxford , that 's what we 're going to do . Look at what 's going on .
And so the difference between <unk> is that , in the same way , it 's also this way of getting productivity , but it is going to be 80 percent of the income distribution in Amazon .
We 'll do this .
We just click on the site of <unk> .
If there 's a guy who 's going to work in this economic despair , this is a website that can look at it .
So what 's going to happen next is the sponsors of sponsors , and then the amount of money that we 're going to offer is that 80 percent of the income will be protected .
It goes from a place where a profit is going to lead to ecological resources .
This is a different company in a new economy .
It 's a form of form , if you like , <unk> 's altruism -- maybe it 's probably .
Whatever it is , regardless of the new economy , we need economies to do that , in fact , to bring investment into the center of a <unk> , and to change it .
It 's just now that investment will continue to be <unk> and <unk> to consumption .
<unk> has to become a different <unk> .
<unk> to become , in new economy , protect and nurture our future .
It 's a hybrid .
It will invest in low - scale technologies and <unk> infrastructure .
We need to invest in , in fact , a <unk> idea , which provides the ability to <unk> .
And of course , this task has ordinary matter .
This is going to be a non - <unk> , if you 're talking about people , and they do n't have food , clothing and clothing .
But <unk> is clearly known as well .
It has social and psychological objectives -- family , <unk> , commitment , social life .
And it also requires investing , investment , for example , in those , we can connect the place where we 're able to engage , and the workplace , the halls , our parks , <unk> , libraries , places , offices , all the places where the <unk> are in a very nice place , to think about " <unk> " in the context of <unk> .
A investment -- investment , ultimately , just a basic economic concept -- it 's a relationship with the future , a collective , and a common future .
We need that relationship to <unk> , to regain hope .
So let me go back to this kind of hope , and people are still trying to take a chunk of money every day to get a plate that 's going to take the price of a plate .
What can we offer ?
Obviously we have a responsibility to help them .
Obviously we have a responsibility to create space - scale space in the most poorest countries .
And this is obviously the obvious thing that we 're going to have to achieve , unless we can redefine the true meaning of these rich countries , a higher <unk> and a much larger pattern for development .
So this is not just a <unk> of the West .
In fact , a philosopher of a African philosopher named Africa wrote me , in " <unk> <unk> , " which is about the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , " My existence is because of your existence . "
<unk> is a common effort .
And it 's the bedrock of <unk> , and its foundation , I 've tried to show you , has already been there .
So this is n't about the development of the development .
It 's not <unk> capitalism .
It 's not trying to change human nature .
What we 're doing here is to take a few simple steps for the right economy .
In that economy , we use a much more reliable , more practical way of looking at what it means to humans .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : It 's going to move on the stage , quick , very quickly .
First of all , economists should n't be quite surprising , so you have to have a lot of money on this <unk> .
Can you think about it every <unk> solution ?
I mean , you can think about a politicians in England saying , " GDP per capita this year , good news .
We 're actually happier , and this country becomes better , our lives become better . "
Tim Jackson : That 's obviously not what you 're doing .
You do n't have news for the news .
And you 're going to tell you what we 're going to do .
How do I solve the politicians ?
Actually , I 've seen some .
And when we first started doing this , politicians should stand up and go out and get out of the way , <unk> us , <unk> us .
In fact , in the past decade , we 've been doing this -- partly because of the financial crisis and some major economics -- people talk about this world in the world .
Chris Anderson : But that 's essentially the <unk> of the police , or only a few Muslims ?
Tim Jackson : You must have firms . There must be civic society .
But it needs political leaders .
This is a strategy , in fact , the politicians themselves are stuck in that challenge because they 're <unk> .
But actually the way to think about different kinds of management , different police , create space for civic social and business , is absolutely crucial .
Chris Anderson : And if someone wants to convince you that we can do -- what is it ?
Tim Jackson : I always want to know that you 're going to go down to the end of the century , and it 's going to reduce the problem from the atmosphere , and the problem is that the environmental diversity of the ecology has to do something about the surface of <unk> and water , and it 's the <unk> of a water that does n't want to go to the water and do it in a sense that they 're doing something like the fluid , which is <unk> with water - and - <unk> <unk> .
If you can convince me that we can do this , then , yes , I 'm willing to choose that two percent .
Chris Anderson : <unk> , Tim , thank you very much . Thank you .

And in the Gulf of ice oil , <unk> seals , and said that Ground Zero and <unk> are actually a <unk> , but <unk> the entire thing is that it 's going to be the real center of the whole thing : <unk> oil - consumption , she shares a bold plan to get to the fact that the United States is approaching the timeless value of oil .
disaster relief , energy , environment , green , oil , sustainability
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : The chemical structure of oil
I want to talk about the political structure of oil spills , and why it 's important , the <unk> whales , but why we need to keep focus on focus .
But before I talked about politics , let me talk about oil .
This photo was taken out of the <unk> of Alaska , and I was visited in Alaska when I went to see the U.S. foreign convention that they were burning .
Now you can see a few stars , you see some ice ice , and you 'll see two <unk> in the <unk> .
They 're really good at catching up .
This is actually a very abstract thing about oil for us in the United States .
We are four percent of the population population ; we 're killing 25 percent of the world 's population .
We do n't know what oil is , until you test it . Until you see this stuff , you understand that it 's going to melt .
This is when it 's burning .
And it goes " <unk> . "
I urge you to find the opportunity to see the oil ticket , because you 're going to never have to listen to the political scientific scientific surgeon .
It will <unk> your retina .
This is that retina is being <unk> .
Let me tell you about oil .
Oil is corn molecules .
It starts from very small molecules , and it 's a carbon - <unk> , four <unk> -- that is methane .
And those are the ones that have the same amount of carbon .
You 've heard about <unk> ; they 're highly depressed .
And then comes back to these huge , rich , clunky molecules that have hundreds of carbon , and they have thousands and thousands of <unk> , but they also have the <unk> and the metals in their side .
These are called <unk> ; they 're the ingredient of conservatives .
They 're very important in the oil spill .
Let me tell you about the amount of oil in the water .
This is the <unk> of the oil that has a lot of fun .
Oil does n't absorb , oil .
If it hit , oil spill is a completely different story .
The other thing is that when oil is exposed to water , it spreads .
It spread into a very big thin thin , so it 's very difficult to make it happen .
What 's going to happen next is that the material material of the light is <unk> , some <unk> migrate into the ceiling , killing the eggs and some fish , and <unk> .
And then <unk> <unk> -- this is what 's going to be done -- asphalt are all filled with <unk> , like <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the number of <unk> in the water , and it makes it hard to deal with it .
It also makes it very glamorous .
When the <unk> boat goes off in Spain , the size of the Arctic is floating into the surface , floating in the sea .
The difficulty of clean things is incredible .
And each one goes to the water .
And when oil and water are moving over the same way , it is a continuum that does n't prevent .
The first time the consumer is faced with oil supply .
They would have " I found it ! "
So I 'm going to tell you a little bit about the origin of political developments , because it 's important for understanding why this summer is so important .
And nobody woke up and said , " Wow , I 'm going to put some <unk> into 12 molecules in <unk> molecules , and my gas is <unk> to work . "
No , they want to be , " Hey , I have to go to the gas .
It 's very upset . These oil companies are fundamentally different .
I do n't make money for them .
It 's <unk> . "
And that 's what we 're doing in <unk> , in fact , is <unk> by <unk> our anger .
You might find a lot of <unk> , including this , looking for <unk> .
I talked to engineers about the engineers , and it 's designed to reduce our anger , because we 're born <unk> .
Look how bad it is .
But in fact , what I 'm talking about is that most of the American people assume that the price of gasoline is a memory , rather than the world of <unk> .
But what 's bad about is that we do n't know what to consume , because we 've designed this system , and if you want to find jobs , first of all , there 's a car that can run and maintain this job , to get a gas drive device .
It 's really ridiculous .
Another <unk> thing is that we 've bought gasoline and we 're doing something else .
This is the U.K. Oil <unk> <unk> .
It 's green ; it looks like a green <unk> .
Now you think , " Why are some of the things that are so strong to convince people ? "
And the reason is , when we buy fuel , we 've got some <unk> .
And we 're very upset about that one .
Not standing here , bought the gas ; the one on the other , we want to do something green .
We <unk> the <unk> of ourselves .
And that 's kind of interesting . It 's really ridiculous .
But actually this is why it 's beyond the oil .
As a part of the energy policy of energy , we do n't talk about how to reduce the weight of oil .
We talked about energy . We talk about <unk> cars .
We have n't been invented yet .
So , <unk> is part of the oil , and it 's also important to tackle oil spills .
Oil politics is a very moral audience .
And the oil is like a big octopus , and it involves engineering and <unk> and everything , but actually we think it 's moral .
This is a picture of <unk> , and you can see here , there 's some <unk> bears .
Some of the reporters saw these ice , and they said , " This is a dirty business . "
But they also see people who do n't make money .
They 're not farmers , they 're not going to die in the land .
This is <unk> new species .
At first , the moral problem of this is that there 's a lot of fun in it .
And then , of course , this is John Jones .
And what 's about John D is that he enters the chaos of this chaotic country , and he 's going to become a <unk> company , a company .
This is very scary . You think Wal - Mart is a terrible operation , and imagine what this is going to look like in the ' 60s or whatever .
This is also what we 're dealing with for oil .
But what 's really amazing is the journalist 's Prime Minister <unk> , and it goes into the grass of the Rockefeller cord .
But in a lot of different ways , the <unk> came to us .
One of the things that 's going to be said about <unk> Bell is that she said , " He has a tight nose , ya .
No anesthesia .
And he <unk> his eyes on his eyes , and he 's filled with <unk> . "
So that person still persists with us .
I mean , this is a very widespread -- this is part of our genes .
And this guy is here .
So , you might like to know why we 've got a high oil or oil spill , and we 're going to send these CEOs to Washington , to <unk> them , trying to suppress them .
This is what we 've been doing since <unk> , when we asked them to ask them , " Why are the ugly managers ? "
We seem to think of the entire oil industry as an ancient <unk> .
We try to look at it from moral perspective , not from one law and Finance .
And I 'm not saying that these people do n't answer questions , I just say , when you look at them whether they have a group of <unk> , you 're actually not looking at the way that they 're going to have the same thing , and you have to make the law , or you start to deal with the <unk> of the oil in the world .
So I said this is a <unk> .
But this is a good ally , very powerful , as you 've seen recently .
And what 's important about oil spills is they have a strong political argument .
I mean , the photos -- this is from the <unk> Oil spill .
This is a picture of some birds .
They 're actually influenced people .
<unk> , oil spill , made the right environmental movement of the <unk> .
And it came to <unk> .
It 's also <unk> the state of the National <unk> <unk> Act , clean air conditioning , beans .
All of the things came out of this period .
I think it 's important to look at the photos of the birds and understand what happens around us .
<unk> , we 're standing in front of the <unk> .
And we looked at these pictures , and we realized that we were in the supply chain .
These are the ones that we 're going to do in the supply chain .
And then we look -- as <unk> , we have a " moment " moments .
That 's why the oil spill is so important .
But we do n't have to be able to focus on the focus , and it 's also important to focus on attention .
We really need access to problems , and problems .
And the last two oil spill we 've dedicated to tackle some of these symptoms .
We 're not passive , but very passive .
So we just came up with the <unk> of the East and the West to the West .
We stopped <unk> in the Arctic , but we actually did n't have to lower oil .
In fact , consumption is increasing .
The only way to reduce our consumption is that the price is higher .
And as you can see , our death rate is <unk> , and we 're very expensive .
We only had two percent of the total oil oil <unk> in the world .
This is another thing that leads to other things . In <unk> , Nigeria , or Nigeria -- it 's about the size of the <unk> -- about twice a year -- tens of thousands of miles per year .
This is like <unk> oil spill , and when we <unk> from those non - <unk> environments .
This is the same thing about <unk> ice cream every year .
We know that oil spill , because we 've seen what 's going on here , these people are alive .
There are thousands of people who have been involved in this year every year , and there are two major areas that are worth about oil , and it 's all about oil .
These people , if they live in the United States , might probably be in this room .
They could have <unk> or <unk> , and they were entrepreneurs . They did n't want to do what they did .
This is actually another group of people who are working on us .
Another thing that we do , because we have to rely on demand , but to play a trick .
One of the big oil programs in this area is where oil companies are responsible for oil .
The United States is paying attention to the U.S. bank , and the World Wide Web , and Exxon 's Law .
This is a huge <unk> problem .
And I was there .
And we went through this very black path , and there was a guy who came out of the green <unk> . I said , " Ah ! This is . "
And then there was a guy who came out of a moment and came out and realized that it was important .
They have their own personal military army .
But at the same time , <unk> becomes more stable , we 're not paying attention .
We paid these sacrifices in April per April .
We do the same thing with <unk> <unk> to the ocean .
This is <unk> . This year we had the oil launch in Iran .
At the time , the U.S. was starting to expand , and we were n't paying for <unk> .
We do surgery in April , and we ca n't even calculate the cost of these <unk> .
There 's a place where it 's going to depend on the oil that 's dependent on oil , to support our consumption of consumption , which is not part of the <unk> .
Now , what 's happening in the Gulf -- as you can see here , this is about gasoline and oil .
It becomes so unpredictable .
It does n't have a lot of <unk> in the Arctic , but it 's also a bird - protected civilization , but it 's supposed to be a bird protected .
And every time you buy gasoline , half of them are actually in the coast , because the fumes actually has about 50 percent dead and lots of ships .
So people in the Gulf are essentially governed by a <unk> environment .
And finally , the families in the United States are also <unk> .
On the other hand , the price in the Arctic is not very high when you think about oil , but in other words , it 's the fact that people have no other transportation option , which means that they pay for a lot of <unk> , and most of them are in a <unk> car .
If you look at some people , they have two dollars per year , two kids , and they might have three or more jobs .
They 're actually spending more money in the car and prices than they are on tax and health care .
Same thing happened 50 percent .
The cost of oil is a huge amount of money in the U.S. economy , but it 's an enormous benefit of the family , when you 're going to think about it .
So I 'm going to tell you now , how do we do this ?
What about the law ? What do we do ?
<unk> is , we need to get away from those <unk> .
We should get away from <unk> .
We should return to those molecules .
<unk> is , but we need to focus on the molecule .
And one thing we need to do is we do n't have to deceive ourselves to think about ourselves , and we can have a green world .
We need to focus on less oil .
Now this image you see here is the <unk> of oil in the U.S.
It 's going to come from here -- useful stuff . These are useless things , it 's called wet energy , which is called the <unk> energy .
You can see that the waste is much more practical .
One of the things that we need to do is that it 's not just suppressing our transportation rate to make them more effective , and we have to stabilize our economy .
We need more fuel .
For example , we have a insurance system for a year in the last year , and it 's the equivalent of three miles of people who have spent three miles of people who have been able to do this for a ride .
This is actually encouraging people to drive more miles .
We have rewards on <unk> policy . There are all sorts of strategies .
We need more flexibility .
We need to make the price better for fuel .
We need to combine the <unk> of <unk> every year , at least 50 years per year to improve the state of people in the classroom .
And whether you can have more effective cars , or create a market - sharing market , that 's what we need to do .
We need to make all this stuff , and you 'll find more about this .
This policy is called " <unk> , " which is <unk> . "
Same content in <unk> .
All the important thing about this is that we 're trying to engage in the face of the <unk> , and think about who we are , in a special moment , where we have the entire link between the link .
If you look at the political risks in the United States in America , it 's like <unk> .
And I would say one dollar per gallon is a little bit expensive , but I think if we start with three cents per year in this year , it 's going to increase the amount of time that you go from the hospital , and then , nine cents a year -- and we 're trying to get people to be able to keep the flow of consumption in two and a half .
Let me show you how it works .
This is a swimming gas , assumed , 10 years later .
The first thing is , in this <unk> , a more <unk> American budget -- a penny .
You do n't feel like you 're going to feel helpless .
And there 's a <unk> tag here , and it 's very similar to what you see on the <unk> box .
And what it said is that every 15 percent of the <unk> in the state of National <unk> is the cost of health care per gallon for health . "
There are many .
<unk> -- you can see that you pay a lot of health care in town .
And also , expectations is that you start interacting with this huge system .
At the same time , there 's a number of other things that you can <unk> to get more information , or a different car , whatever you 're going to do is actually reduce your dependent on oil .
And according to the whole policy , we can actually reduce the oil on the Atlantic -- or in the winter .
That 's a three - mile per day .
But for doing this , one thing we have to do is we need to remember that we depend on hydrocarbons .
We have to focus on molecules on the molecule , do n't do it because of <unk> , there 's no green possibility .
We need to go seriously seriously , to reduce our current relationship with these <unk> and molecules .
Thank you .

Yves <unk> lists two and " <unk> of the American <unk> " -- on the show of Afghanistan and <unk> , showing the astonishing effects of television .
culture , entertainment , global issues , poetry , politics
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : A <unk> of paper
And I want to ask you about three people in the world ?
You probably have the first one .
I do believe you 're all , " <unk> <unk> . "
You might n't know that <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , and she 's the founder of " <unk> " -- that 's not the end of the whole world , but it 's not only in the entire world of the world .
This is a game that allows us to create and break out the original Greek poetry , and it 's a tradition of a traditional <unk> poetry .
<unk> <unk> is also a final project , and she 's participating in what Afghanistan is singing .
And before I proceed , I know the word " England " is the <unk> .
But the point here is to say , I 'm going to tell you that I can use these <unk> players who are involved in text , and how they change their <unk> .
I 'm going to give you an example of the <unk> of Afghanistan and the Arab world in Afghanistan , and they change the way conflict is n't derived by the West , but by <unk> the languages of <unk> .
It 's all about play .
We 've got to look at Afghanistan .
We 're going to see " Afghanistan in Afghanistan . "
We 're going to date .
We have to look at Afghanistan .
These are all handmade .
In Afghanistan , people are not going to see this show .
They do n't have a television .
It 's all over the street , and even in the public , there 's even one side .
But it 's not just about just looking at this simple , because part of that is the Grand Canyon .
People are participating in even the winner , and the volunteers of the political elections are the ones who do n't want to support them .
They 're also sold to themselves .
And of course , some people are just <unk> from the part of the area , but not completely so .
Because it 's all from different tribal communities .
It 's all about <unk> , especially for women .
And one of the founders of <unk> had two <unk> of <unk> .
One of the founders of <unk> is the chief <unk> , from a very conservative area .
She told us , in " <unk> of Afghanistan , " she was told that her friends were n't going to say she did n't want to go to the government .
But at the same time , she said that she knows that there 's a lot of <unk> consultants who voted for her .
<unk> <unk> is also the founder of <unk> , which is <unk> - <unk> .
And I had to say , her husband started to support her .
But her tribal community and family does n't support her , or her family .
But when she started the competition , they started to support her .
It seems to be the values of competition and <unk> .
She 's participating in playing .
<unk> poetry is about women and women .
Just by showing you , by the way , from the <unk> of men and men , you 've got a lot of young people who have young women in the world , and the audience has a young audience , or the audiences .
And you might think , " American American <unk> " will make a difference .
But it 's not true .
And by the way , through the form of traditional culture , the Jews , in fact , managed to <unk> the attention of the <unk> of people , <unk> , and dance , poetry and music .
In Afghanistan , in the Taliban <unk> , the <unk> music has been introduced for several years to introduce their traditional tradition .
They were singing their willingness to <unk> in Afghanistan .
They 're also starting to learn how to accept failures rather than their failures .
It 's important .
In the end , an exhibition in the form of a word of American American <unk> is called " fighter . "
In the show , people say <unk> , and they 're voting .
There is a lot of young people who are very young , but they 're not going to travel in president , but they 're going to make a difference .
To me , the potential meaning is to see how to influence reality .
Thank you .

When he went down to the Arctic , he would never wake up when he did n't wake cold cold , and then he heard about the <unk> <unk> -- a whole <unk> of <unk> ice -- that 's not only a new amount of swimming .

Yves Behar on the <unk> of <unk>
Last year , when I stood up here , I was talking about the ice in the Arctic .
And it happened to me three years ago , like yesterday .
I remember that I was standing on the edge of the ice , and I thought , I think I would never see this place on Earth .
The water is very black .
The temperature of water is <unk> degrees centigrade , <unk> <unk> .
This is the ice of <unk> ice .
And then a thought in my head : if this <unk> problem , I spent time on the underside of the mountain that 's going to happen to the bottom of this high - wing <unk> , which is a high - speed bottom to the bottom ?
And then I asked myself , I 'm going to take this idea to my <unk> .
And you can get me out of this cold water , and then the only way to climb up for four kilometers is to listen to my iPod , so I 've heard about all of the song , I heard all the songs , from the <unk> opera to <unk> , to the edges of <unk> .
This was a swimming dive for 18 seconds , but it was 18 days .
And I remember that when I came out of the boat , I looked at my finger and I watched my fingers really like <unk> , because -- you know , the cells of our bodies were <unk> -- and then I was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And I did n't have a moment when I went through the flow of water , and I never had to swim in the <unk> water .
So that , last year , I heard <unk> and <unk> -- because of the ice that melts in climate change .
I heard this ice , <unk> .
This <unk> was formed for a few years ago .
And then these <unk> left here and left this piece of ice .
And so I believe that I 'm going to have to go to see what I 'm going to see in the Earth .
There are only 20 billion people in the world -- a third of the population of Earth population -- <unk> water .
And the speed of the world has developed this speed , and the ice provides -- because the changes of climate change -- so it 's so fast , I have a very shaky threat threat .
We 're in China . We 've got China ; we have India , Pakistanis , Pakistan , <unk> , all countries .
And so I decided to go through the <unk> , and how the Earth was going to land after a <unk> <unk> .
I do n't know , you have opportunities for <unk> , but it 's a test .
It 's about 28 percent of all the equipment that goes up to the <unk> -- I 'm not only projecting my legs , and there 's a crew team that 's going to wrestle with the world .
This challenge is not only about <unk> .
What I want to do is , I think , swimming in the sea of <unk> <unk> .
So <unk> heaven .
It 's very , very <unk> . You have a parachute .
You feel a person who 's going to get a little girl in your mailbox .
That 's not the worst .
And the worst thing is that this year they decided to do a <unk> in <unk> .
A lot of <unk> in <unk> , and then they decided that they were going to get rid of all the flesh and then put them up .
And when you want to do something , some of the things that do n't have done , in fact , fish are <unk> . In <unk> <unk> , there 's no fish there . When you try to try and do these things , then you can see that these bears are going to be a little bit more powerful , and you 're aware of it more .
And then we went through this path .
And then there 's a huge <unk> on our right hand .
And then we 're looking at the ice that 's going to see ice vessel ice cream ice cream .
And then we get to one of the <unk> in <unk> , and then I started to prepare myself , as usual , that it would be very difficult for swimming .
I take my iPod , I heard the song , and I 'll give you a little bit of <unk> -- but it can control me with the water -- and then I <unk> my water .
And I was trying to <unk> , and I had a lot of problems at the beginning , I realized that I had a huge problem .
I ca n't breathe .
I have <unk> .
And then I started <unk> , and this caused me on water .
And so it 's all happened so much -- I do n't know how to do it -- but I 'm not going to die .
But luckily , the water <unk> , I can jump from the atmosphere and eat the other eating .
And I said , insisted , struggle , insist .
I went to <unk> six feet , and I got rid of the boat .
But I do n't know where to go from the ground to the quickest speed of the atmosphere .
I heard about the most important way you could die .
I never heard this nonsense .
That 's the most terrifying feeling you 've ever experienced .
I took myself off my <unk> .
And my <unk> grabbed me , and then we 've lost the fastest speed of the speed -- in astronomy -- to us .
And there we sit down and we sat down , and then we 've got a little bit wrong in the <unk> .
And then my players told me .
And they say , <unk> , you have to have a <unk> change if you want to finish this swimming .
You have to forget everything in the last 12 years .
And you 've got to learn what you 're learning in the U.K. , about the speed of <unk> and <unk> , you have to sit down .
We want you to spend two days on the hill .
spend a little while to think about it .
We want to spend two days on the hill . Do n't get wet , but slowly slowly <unk> .
You do n't need feathers , but use it .
And remember , do n't get <unk> .
It was time to go swimming .
So we went back two days later to the airport .
I 'm standing on the edge of the lake , and then look at the <unk> -- she 's the most beautiful meme on Earth -- I think it 's like this .
And then I <unk> this ice .
I could n't tell you when I got to the other side of the lake , I felt good .
But I was studying two very important lessons to two , very critical lessons , and I 'm very grateful to tell my <unk> .
And the first thing is , no matter how to do it , it does n't mean what the future is .
And the same thing , now , before I do something , I asked myself , how do I have an attitude to success .
And then to think about climate change , which is , <unk> and all sorts of questions -- ca n't be because we 've lived like this , so that we have a long time to do this for long - long long days , and not because of that population growth , it means we can do it like that .
<unk> signals .
When I was born , the population of the world is 35 billion .
Now there 's a <unk> billion , and we expect to have 90 billion .
And here 's the second lesson here , <unk> change .
And I 'm here to come here today : how do you make a <unk> change in your environment , and how to ensure that our grandchildren can live in a safe sense of insurance , the most important world ?
And then I asked you , please , come from here , and imagine what you 're going to do . How radical change can make a huge difference .
There 's a lot of these sorts of statements about these changes , and they 're talking about it , but it 's just impossible to look at it , because if we take control of it .
So thank you very much indeed .

Susan <unk> on life in life
Okay , let 's start . First , who 's I ?
Everybody asked me what I did , and I always told you .
" I 'm doing hardware , because that can be done directly .
This is a recent event in Silicon Valley , and I 'm going to tell you what it is .
And I was really stupid .
And I should say something else .
And then I think that I can say that if we look at 100 years , we 've seen a couple of questions about all sorts of problems , and the big problems are clean and clean , clean energy -- and this is a little bit more <unk> and much more open and richer and so forth .
It 's not saying that we 're going to ignore software or information or computation .
That 's what I 'm talking about today .
I 'm going to tell you how we make things and what we 're going to do .
If you 're a coach , TED will give you a lot of <unk> in front of you , and you have to do it , do n't do that , you 've got a big set of forms that you might like to make a huge amount of content , which you can think of as a future .
That 's the word for the future , and I 've always been nervous because , in fact , you 're absolutely <unk> .
And I was a very clever colleague of mine , and I said , " What if you want to talk about the future ?
My colleague 's <unk> is a brilliant guy , and he says , " The future is great .
It 's better than you can imagine .
We 're going to have the ability to <unk> the gene for the cells , and it allows you to think about it .
Maybe you think that it 's a little bit romantic , but we 've got a lot of big progress on these sorts of things , which is possible .
This is not my work . That 's my good friend .
It 's called the standard <unk> .
It 's developed by a group of groups of <unk> and <unk> , and other people who are very , very , very nice .
What they do is they think of life as a programmable system .
Indeed , you can think of proteins as well as possible .
So this idea is really interesting .
This is a <unk> . It 's a very simple computer .
This is a <unk> helmet .
Or from the computational perspective , it 's like a light switch .
A great student in Switzerland made this thing in a biology .
This is also a competition in the last year of the <unk> , and the student came from a <unk> program for bacterial programming to make sure that bacteria could feel like the light or the hull , or <unk> .
This is really interesting because it means we can use something like <unk> , like " <unk> for <unk> . "
It 's a very interesting trend that we 've lived in the world , and it 's an irrational world that is <unk> , but I think , I 'm going to work in a way that I 've been working on a journey , like Neil <unk> who taught the form of <unk> and function .
I 've got six years of thinking about this , but I 'm going to show you the quality of art , which is a cartoon of the art of science , and this is an artist named <unk> .
That 's what I did with a very nice book called HyperCard <unk> .
And there 's a lot of <unk> in the MIT MIT , and so many of you have been able to describe what I do at the time , but for this book , he does n't need a page . It 's our morality .
And he 's a very interesting kid , and this is his sister <unk> , which is what he is doing right now , looking at the <unk> of his career .
In fact , you can use the programming , to self - assembly , so he comes from the chocolate , and he starts to change the <unk> of <unk> water and <unk> .
From the theory , if you have enough effects , you can make something fun to create a very complex structure .
He 's very interested in three - dimensional complex structures , right now .
That 's what I 've been thinking about , because it 's the way we 're building things .
This is a <unk> , which is essentially a lot of light , a lot of <unk> material released .
It 's on the side of a 65 <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> on the right .
It 's a huge coat of coat <unk> in the ocean .
And it 's about the diameter of the 20 <unk> and it 's a complex 3D structure .
We can also use a lot of other things for the computer to build a three - dimensional structure of <unk> <unk> .
And the truth of biology is that it 's in the context of the ecology , and this is a <unk> that is actually an <unk> , actually , a supercomputer who used to replicate DNA .
And those <unk> are the other functional computer that helps the protein to make proteins .
And I 've been trying to think of a very interesting thing about <unk> <unk> , whether the physical material can be used ?
Can we design that machine ?
Can we make complex 3D structures in a credible <unk> system ?
Because the <unk> system has a good advantage , like more high - speed <unk> , and so on .
That 's how my job is to build a system that can replicate self - replicate .
It 's a little bit like a computer - old computer .
These are <unk> computers .
These are five - channel dynamics .
And you can see that there are three types of light switches switches .
In the natural state , they do n't negotiate .
But if I do that , they can actually replicate self - replicate .
Let 's start with white , blue and blue , white .
They 're called <unk> , and they 're able to replicate , from one to two to four .
So we 've got this system of self - replicating systems .
It was originally a dad named <unk> <unk> 's dad .
And he did a lot of research in the ' 80s , but so many of his theories about logic , because we went to the digital computer revolution , and we 've seen it again .
And then I 'm going to show you a <unk> process of <unk> , which is limited to <unk> .
These are the green ones that you type of green and green , yellow , yellow , green .
We put it on the table , and we put it on the table .
And so , a lot of scientists are scared of this game , and if you look at a long time , it feels like you 've seen a plate of chains from the ingredient .
We 've seen the bits of glass .
But why do you make glass safety ?
Because the <unk> of biology is , you take a linear <unk> cell , and it 's very easy to replicate it , so you can fold it into complex 3D structures .
So I think we 're going to use a mechanical system with <unk> , and what do you do ?
And what you see here is that we can take a two - dimensional coat B - y page -- it 's based on the basis of <unk> .
And what we 're trying to do is to create very simple principles , because we do n't need to rely on numbers .
So we can do something more like a smaller chip .
So you can do that as a form of basic materials to make something more complex .
And I 'd like to show you a little bit about this video , but I 'm going to just show you a little bit about it .
This is the picture of the <unk> building .
Each color has a different <unk> database that can be simulated structure .
If you understand a little bit about knowledge , you 're going to feel very comfortable , because it can also evolve for any three three - dimensional structure , and actually , I can draw a dog and turn it into a <unk> , to make sure that I could have three dimensions to be <unk> .
It 's a very interesting thing that happens when you look at the world .
The whole universe is a <unk> machine .
And so I thought , well how do you think about the laws of physics ?
How do we bring materials to the problems of the fabric and the problem of computation ?
It 's not just about the end , but it makes the structure and the mechanics , and the machinery itself becomes the computer .
When you understand this idea , we can see a lot of problems in different ways .
And if the universe is a computer , then you can think of this as a kind of an architect .
You give it some conditions , like gravity , density , etc , and so forth , the universe gives you a perfect <unk> lens .
So the same kind of thinking can be used to tackle other problems , like five to 10 million people in the world , ca n't buy it .
Can we create a machine that allows it to be in any place where people need to , in the fastest speed of the speed that people need ?
This machine is a machine that you really need to give you some <unk> .
For example , <unk> is the <unk> lens .
If you 're <unk> , you can make <unk> chips .
And then you put it on top , and it 's going to require another process .
In fact , if you have two input data , the edge of the edges and the pressure and our pressure can be able to stack the entire <unk> of human beings , which is 12 to eight percent per day .
And then I <unk> it into the <unk> .
I 'm going to work on <unk> .
This is a couple of minutes of <unk> .
Put it on top of the <unk> , and then you fall up , and then you fall out .
I saw this video , but I do n't know whether it 's true .
<unk> came out . This is a very old one , and we have the new prototype , actually , in the two days of <unk> , which allows you to see the truth .
After the lens , we put it on it .
It would be the next year of <unk> <unk> , a lens shaped by a lens .
And you 'll see that it has a very small amount of pain .
And when I rotate from the side , you 'll see that it 's <unk> , and we 're able to create the physical characteristics of the system .
This is a way of thinking about the structures of structures and structures that can enable other things .
This is what I did in my friends 's friends .
I talked about rope , you think very complex .
When it comes to an <unk> , it looks a structure .
A different <unk> will bring different structures , and you can add <unk> fibers into a sensor .
So this is a rope that can perceive <unk> , and you can know that the amount of <unk> is the size of the rope .
When you start looking at the world , then you 're going to do something about the computer .
And now I would like to add here .
I 'm going to tell you some of the stuff that I 'm thinking about .
What I 'm interested in now is that if you look at the universe as a computer , how do we create something normal , and how can we share things in the way that we make things work ?
A lot of people have talked about the fact that there are many people who are focused on a problem , exchanging each other , with collaborative problems .
And as a person , we 're all going to move through the linear <unk> , unless we do it in a linear fashion , and we still do that .
And that means that you do anything , or whatever you make , and you 're going to be able to see it in the early ' 70s , looking at this thing and show it to the most beautiful way to show this .
Their product is the best <unk> .
So I thought , how do we make things that we engineered ? Are people like this ?
And I think that 's all about the idea of <unk> .
Now , Patricia <unk> talked yesterday about how I can let everyone participate in design the process of design .
And if you look at the talk of <unk> Smith , she 's talking about how to get MIT to go to Haiti to help people build their community .
I think we need to re - redefine and think about structures , materials and things that make information into reality , and how we can develop a better way to do things in other people .
Now I do n't know how to do it , but I think many people are trying to think about this problem .
So the question is that this is <unk> ? Is this <unk> path ?
There 's a lot of fun .
And maybe I 'm going to tell you a little bit about this , but if we go back to this cartoon , I think that the future will become very common , from biology to materials , and I hear Bill Joy 's talk , which is very surprising . It 's a real theory of Bill Joy
They 're wanting to invest in the <unk> , but we 've seen this new <unk> .
How can we look at real information and <unk> to really think about the world in different ways ?
But it 's a very interesting view .
I might have a little <unk> .
And I thought I 'd like to -- I think I 'll do something extreme , I 'm going to tell you something .
I 'll show you that video .
This is a <unk> of a 3,000 square - meter diameter that can be <unk> .
And it 's a very different view of the universe .
This is <unk> designed by <unk> .
Why do you do this big <unk> ?
It 's exactly the size of your family .
That 's because you 're very quick to get a boat .
And I 'm also doing this in some friends .
This is another point of view -- if you give me a abstract language , it 's a structure that is defined by the universe .
You can do it like <unk> , but the calculations of physics allow it to be a very strong atmosphere .
And it 's really interesting that the speed of the boat is so interesting to the future .
<unk>
How do you get the resources in the city to save the future of the world ? <unk> <unk> demonstrates some of these very characteristics of community - based green forms for us to expand our needs .
architecture , cities , collaboration , design , energy , environment , green , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : The future of tomorrow
There is a profound debate about climate change and becoming more robust , because we know we need to pay .
We know that , in fact , the people who live in the developed world need to engage the work of <unk> .
And so there 's a little bit of that , and it 's not just a priority .
And when we look at the real problem and the big problems , it feels a little bit wrong .
When the tricky problem is , we 're trying to figure out how to find a simple solution .
I think this is what we 're doing right now .
We see emissions rising gases -- they come from our galleries and <unk> and so forth , and then we say , " Well , the problem is that they 're burning from fossil fuels , so it 's going to be a solution to the fossil consumption .
Now , no doubt , we need clean energy , I 'm going to show you that if we think about changing climate problems , then we actually let ourselves break into problems of problems .
And the reason why we live in our lives is fast .
That 's not the news for us .
But sometimes we 're hard enough to remember <unk> .
We 'll have about 80 billion people in the world -- maybe more -- people live in cities .
We 're going to become vulnerable to <unk> species .
In order to provide enough energy for the <unk> of 80 million people in the city , even in places like cities , we have to have a lot of energy .
Maybe we do n't need to be much more clean .
So if we 're serious about how to talk about climate change , we need to find other ways of dealing with other solutions .
This solution is possible , actually , because all the city we built is the opportunity .
In large ways , the city itself is trying to determine the amount of energy they use .
We tend to think of it as an act of behavior -- and I chose to turn this out -- but in fact , our community and the city is already determined , and we 're going to use a lot of energy .
I 'm not going to show you a lot of graph today , but if we look at this piece of paper , it can show that many of the things that we need to understand -- that is , a very simple fact , if you look in the city , the transit is directly connected to the state of <unk> , and it 's a big amount of energy rising into the cities and the <unk> .
And the other thing that they do is , of course , the higher part of the density is that low emissions -- if you think about it , it 's not hard to understand .
We 're basically going to have different ways of doing what we want to do .
We walked out of our hands , and we walked into our <unk> and the cars went into the road .
And usually we use glasses to achieve our expectations .
But when we live in the normal community , we 're going to see that , of course , what we need to do is , of course , things are all around us .
Because the most green way of traveling is that you do n't need to travel <unk> , our lives are much more green .
<unk> communities , of course , completely impossible .
Some of the places that are doing something like this are developing a whole new dynamic , and if you understand this job , you feel that it 's great , but most of that , we 're talking about the city of a city that we have .
So what we 're more interested in is the <unk> development : that 's the kind of thing that we have in the building and the development of things that are developing .
Cities <unk> : That 's the kind of space that we 've used in the city , and we 're using different kinds of new space and use .
<unk> , we realize that we do n't need to increase the density of the entire city .
Instead of adding cities to one percent of the average average , we did n't have one .
We can do this with some specific density .
You can think of it as a couple of filaments of <unk> , and it 's going to be the total density of the whole city .
We found that when we 're going to do it , in fact , there are a couple of things that are very special in the same area where you have a very big region .
And now we might find a lot of density , but still , their car is actually , in fact , when we put people together in the right conditions , we see a <unk> effect , and when people slip into a place where they think it 's <unk> , they 're going to make a difference .
This is going to save a very very , very significant amount of energy , because it 's just the beginning of the <unk> of the <unk> change .
This is the production of cars , <unk> , all parking lots and lots of <unk> .
When you 're able to solve all of these components , because some people do n't use any kind of equipment that 's going to be 90 percent of the traffic in the entire year , it 's the cause of <unk> .
That 's what people estimated .
In the world , we 've seen more people who are getting more people who are getting <unk> .
And people think that what you think is that you have a dream of dreams becoming a passionate community .
When you use that way of communication , you can see that , in fact , our life will have more choices .
Some of you have options .
This is a map of the <unk> , and it shows from my arrival , in 30 minutes .
Some of you are walking , and it 's not glamorous .
This is a map of Google .
And I asked how to <unk> the big <unk> , and it tells me how to use <unk> .
It does n't show that it 's a <unk> or a walk or a walk .
But technology in the <unk> tools are starting to arise around us .
And as we just heard about how we 're just going to learn how to put information in those non - verbal tools .
In these wireless tools , we 're learning how to put information into these markers and <unk> .
And what we found was that we thought the key to production and consume is to create a lot of products that actually did n't make us live in the extreme environment .
And what we 're looking for is that we hope we want to make things maximum .
My favorite example is trillion examples of <unk> , and in sitting in the seat ? <unk> ?
I have there .
<unk> <unk> is used by six or 20 minutes , depending on who you ask who ask you .
So what we do is we buy these , actually , thousands of hours of drill rate , and then they 're doing a couple of holes on the walls , they put them in the wall .
Our cities , I 'm going to show you a lot of skill for you .
So we try to figure out the new way of using these capabilities -- for example , it 's cooking or <unk> , and even when the <unk> -- we might find that , actually , we 're going to find a lot of service that we need to be able to use the service , which is very clever , that we need to use it .
In fact , even space itself is becoming a service .
We found that people could be able to do something like this .
And the buildings become places where they 're going to join .
So we 've got new design tools that help us need access to energy equipment -- like <unk> and <unk> , and so on -- becomes a mechanical installation .
We make maps of the building .
<unk> dust to heat through the surface of sunlight .
In fact , when we take these design , we found that the cost of the building is 90 percent is 90 percent of the time .
It also brings another <unk> effect called " <unk> <unk> , " which is very simple , if a building does n't need a lot of money .
And the cost of architecture is more than less than before .
Now , when we 're going to cut the goods consumption , we cut transportation , and all of these things are great , but there 's some things that need to improve .
If we want real <unk> , we need to think about something different .
There 's a solution here .
This is a logarithmic campaign , and it 's about how powerful they are .
They think that a sustainable city has to be <unk> by the green city .
So we have this kind of thing .
So imagine this .
These are really good ideas , but they 're missing a lot of important things that are n't very important at the bottom , and the system behind behind is the system .
So , for example , they do n't use the rain to reduce the water .
<unk> <unk> .
What they do is they have a green foundation , which is also the bottom of the <unk> , and it 's also used to use the water , and it can also be used for life .
And if you go back to the ecosystems around us , the river bears around the globe .
And they 're thinking about the willingness to deliver flowers to pollinate neighbors so that the bees and the <unk> are brought back to our cities to our cities ?
Even if they 're able to use resources , meat , <unk> , etc , they go back to the soil , and they do it in the way that we use cities to make carbon .
And I want to tell you all that it is n't just what they 're being used to use .
Because now , the way our economy works , like Paul <unk> says , " <unk> future resources in the future , <unk> GDP . "
If you increase over 90 billion or a half billion dollars or tens of billions , it 's just a six billion people who live in the world , and if people are still living on this planet , they 're going to be very quickly on this planet .
But if we think about it , I think we can have something that is not just the city of <unk> , and we have a infinite possibility .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
Stephen <unk> shows the speed of the <unk> of modern violence in the world , and even though it does n't look very glamorous , Iraq , Darfur , coastal areas , but in fact , now , we 're in a world of peace .
business , culture , global issues , media , violence , war
<unk>
Stephen <unk> : You eliminate kindness
This picture is taken in the <unk> camp of the 20th century , and the perception of our perception is that we have a new understanding of what we 're seeing in our own environment and our era .
In the 20th century , we 've seen the most <unk> marriage of anesthesia , <unk> and <unk> , Rwanda , and so on for seven years , even 21 years of <unk> in the 21st century -- and we also see the <unk> of the romantic century .
These events cause us to think about the state of violence , and maybe , in the early world , people are still doing that .
And I can give you a example of a few years ago , the Boston world , in Boston , and the author of <unk> wrote " Though the Indian difficulty , they 're not going to face the war , but they do n't have a lot of war in their neighborhoods , not in both sides , even in two tribes , which are not <unk> by the form of war , even in two tribal <unk> .
We know from the TV and the books , and it 's a curriculum that teaches the story of the book , " You know what the truth is , I 'm going to give you the evidence for violence , in fact , where our ancestors are in the world , but the amount of violence in our history is probably the most likely that we 're in .
And in this era , in the ' 80s , the history of the Iraq War , it sounds like a <unk> , but I 'm going to show you the fact that the truth is that it does n't happen .
In the West , obviously , from the U.K. and the Holland , it 's in the <unk> .
Let me show you a little bit about the amount of power to measure the way that they 're going to get to work in 1984 to tell you about it , and until a thousand years ago , it 's been taken in a whole range of years , without <unk> behavior , but the <unk> , the state of the world , has been viewed by the fact that the <unk> of modern <unk> -- which is the best evidence of looking at the modern world -- the way that <unk> <unk> is looking for the contemporary <unk>
This is the chart of his <unk> showing that male men are dead in some <unk> and died .
The red line is the probability of male death in the face of other people who died from the <unk> <unk> and the Amazon forests .
It 's about 60 and 15 percent of the people in the face of others , and the bottom line on the left - hand side , the blue line , which is two years of data in America and Europe , has twice the world 's data . If the military deaths are <unk> , there are two billion people who die at the twentieth century .
And the same way that we 're going to see the early civilizations of the ancient civilization , in the Bible , and we can see that the moral principle of our theory are called <unk> , which is called " <unk> <unk> " -- who said , " Well , they 're <unk> the <unk> of dead women , <unk> all the women who have gone to the face of <unk> . " In the ' 80s , you 've got to get rid of what 's going on with a girl and a child , but if you
You can find four or four signs in the Bible .
In the same way , in the Bible , there are <unk> ways of being <unk> for example , such as <unk> , addiction , purity , <unk> and <unk> .
Now , let 's zoom in on the vertical axis , looking at the data for the <unk> .
Even though we do n't have the evidence from all of the wars in the modern world , we 're just going to have a lot of evidence about the evidence that the human society is in the history of the human society , and it 's been <unk> .
For example , anything that has been documented , or <unk> , is the <unk> <unk> methods , and now only let you get a <unk> violation , in the past possible , <unk> and <unk> .
There are hundreds of thousands of miles across the world , and there 's no way of being in the world , and it 's <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and so on .
There 's a long list of <unk> <unk> : For example , <unk> bread , and , of course , the <unk> of Iran is a moral force , which is <unk> , but perhaps the most powerful example of the way you 're going to have the " <unk> " , " and the ' <unk> ' behavior in the air , it 's <unk> in <unk> .
So what do you do about the <unk> ? That 's because a lot of <unk> reveal <unk> .
<unk> , in the <unk> of Europe , <unk> in Europe to find the amount of <unk> that he can find , the rural village , and the Arctic , it 's the same data that has all the data on the history of the world .
And he was using a lateral , <unk> , 100 percent of the deaths in every year , which is a little bit less likely to go down every single year per year -- less than seven , eight or eight years , and then in the ' 50s , there are sub - Saharan Africa who says that ice force has a certain sense of morality .
But it 's a reduction in <unk> data , at least two orders of data from the <unk> of the <unk> century .
And then the next decade is observed .
And according to some kind of data , data in <unk> , from 1945 , in Europe and in North Europe , and even in the South Africa , there 's a relatively rapid decline in war rates . In the world , wars between the World War II .
As you can see , death rates from the <unk> war in 1950 , 10 years of war , every year , despite these wars .
Even in 1984 , it can also look at the decrease of violence .
Since the end of the Cold War , civil war is rarely happening at least <unk> , and indeed , the data from the World War II is 90 percent , even in the late ' 80s , there 's a little amount of separation between the <unk> .
This is the <unk> crime <unk> , and it 's about 50 to 60 years of <unk> in the ' 50s and ' 60s .
In Japanese , if you 're in this , thank you very much .
So the question is , why do n't you have a lot of problems with this important problem ? Well , I think so many reasons .
<unk> is even more <unk> . " In this world , it 's better than the <unk> of the 16th century , and " <unk> " in the world . "
There 's a cognitive illusion : we understand the more you know some of the things , and you 're more easy to do .
We read the <unk> of the paper every day , which is much more powerful than the impact of our memory , than many people in the bed , the market and the markets , there 's no way of saying , " It 's going to be more better than just saying , " They 're getting better . "
In <unk> societies , we do n't talk about the <unk> of the community , and we <unk> some good things in the West .
And of course , our standard change is more powerful than the changes of our behavior , the <unk> of the violence and the cruelty .
And that process is probably going to continue , but if it 's more powerful than the current criteria , things are more <unk> than they 're looking at the history of history , and so , now , we 're groomed -- and if there 's a hundred - year - old <unk> , you do n't think that a few hundred years later , it is , if you have a couple of years of treaties , they do not think about the evidence that the <unk> are going to be <unk> at 10 minutes .
So , why is violence down ? No one can really answer this question , but I have to tell you about four explanations , and I think , <unk> , the first explanation is that the <unk> of the world is the " <unk> " -- and that 's what <unk> <unk> is a <unk> ; it 's a good thing , because , you know , there 's an <unk> in the middle of his neighborhood , which is , " It 's <unk> . "
He saw a <unk> <unk> .
They were thinking , " I do n't want to kill that person , but he might kill me .
Maybe I 've got a chance I had to kill him , even though , he could n't even kill me , and he might think that I was killing me before he killed me .
And the hunting of the hunter - <unk> people , usually , to think of themselves as being killed and kill their neighbors .
Now , a way to solve this problem is by <unk> .
You do n't have to attack , but you 're going to show you that if you 've been dumped , you 'll be <unk> .
And the only thing that came to suggest is that it 's called " <unk> , " so it can only be possible in the paranormal situations . To make it possible , you have to get rid of all the matrix , but it 's a <unk> loop .
Life became a channel to show " Family family . " <unk> solves the solution , " which means that if the legal force of violence is a single democracy , it 's a state of <unk> <unk> , and then a country can get rid of it , because a nation - <unk> is going to kill other people because it will be <unk> by the <unk> of the other .
And it could be able to break yourself into the <unk> of your own <unk> , so therefore it will cause a state of peace to peace in the next slide , and in front of the slides , you do n't see the same amount of the rise in Europe .
That 's a little portrait of the <unk> theory .
And to support it , we 've seen the amount of <unk> that we see today : in the <unk> region of the country , <unk> , the Japanese , the <unk> , the streets and so on .
And the second explanation is that there 's a lot of thinking about the common thinking of life .
At the early days , when the <unk> and the Grand Canyon associated with a very normal person , people do n't have a lot of money for people to die or die , and when technology and economical benefits are more powerful , people have a higher amount of <unk> in life .
political scientists have been arguing about this .
And the idea is that the concept of " <unk> " and " play " is in the book of Robert <unk> 's book , " The Book of <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> says technology has been <unk> by the game of play , and humans are often <unk> to allow goods , trade and ideas in many ways .
And it turns out that other people live longer than death , because the reason for violence is that violence goes down , and one of the reasons why I think we do n't have to bomb Japan is one of the reasons why they 're building my influence . "
And the fourth explanation is that <unk> <unk> is written by philosophers , and he suggests that evolution tells humanity to human beings . Unfortunately , in <unk> state , we 're only going to use this ability to <unk> his friends and family .
And in <unk> people thought that they were waiting to be waiting , but in the history of history , what was going to happen in history is to see , it was spread from the village to <unk> , extending into the country , expand to the state , spread across the world , expanding the <unk> of other species , and the question is , if it 's really important , that 's what drives it to a <unk> species .
There is a whole range of possibilities in this sense that Robert <unk> thinks it 's a <unk> <unk> .
The miracle of the Golden Rule is : the more you have to empathize with other people , more and more , you 're more aware of your benefit , at least in a place where you want them to listen to your interests , and you ca n't say that I 'm standing in the middle of that moment , which is the universe , because that 's the place that you 're standing in in that moment because you are sitting in that moment .
It also is possible to expand : according to the history of history , <unk> and reality , the reality of the real magic and the literature , that allows you to incorporate the lives of your life , and to realize that your own life is <unk> .
And because of the reason , the rate of violence has profound implications . It needs to say , " Why do you have war ? "
Because we 've done something about what we 're doing .
Thank you very much .

Chris Anderson : I love this talk . I think a lot of people in this room will say that <unk> -- and that 's what you 're telling you , Peter <unk> says , well , the <unk> of the world , because it 's a little bit more <unk> .
<unk> : Very optimistic . This is the theory of <unk> theory , allowing us to enjoy the benefits of collaboration , and I think it helps us think about what 's going to happen to other people who are terrible , but you think , when you read something , they do n't think that they can make sense of what they 're doing with the other person , which is , in fact , that it can do something that is <unk> to empathize .
CA : Very good , Steve , I hope everybody 's going to hear this talk next year . I think that 's important . Thank you very much .
<unk> : That 's my privilege .

<unk> is a serious problem in the Congo , where aid goes into this country , and it 's not enough to use money or less , why ?
Africa , business , global issues , military , philanthropy
<unk>
Amy <unk> : In Congo , <unk>
I 'm a marketing Carter , and I 'm working on international modification .
This year I spent a period of time in the Congo , which is the second largest country in Africa .
<unk> and <unk> are only 300 miles per gallon .
That 's a dangerous place .
In the decade , there are 500 million people who die in wars .
But the war is not the only reason the people live .
There 's a lot of health .
In fact , HIV is in adult adult business .
It 's not a big ratio , but it 's a hundred million people in the middle of a country .
<unk> infrastructure is very <unk> , so it 's only about 25 percent of the population .
This is also why <unk> institution provide free or less .
So I spent a lot of time with people who talk about <unk> , including <unk> .
She 's running on a hotel .
It just goes back to midnight , so it 's not an inclusive place .
But it 's a place where audiences and their clients are <unk> .
It 's hard to get rid of <unk> .
He says it does n't need a need .
This is not surprising because it 's only <unk> people .
Joseph and <unk> runs a <unk> , and they say , despite the amount of money they serve for free , they do n't have access to money , but their customer does n't buy the logo .
They liked no branding .
I 'm curious about this as a marketing person .
So I started looking at marketing .
The foundation of the candidates are focused on three questions , three reasons , thinking about smoking , fear , economy , loyalty , <unk> .
They have similar names for <unk> or <unk> .
And what they 're doing with <unk> <unk> is that we 're HIV - AIDS , and we put it into this box , which is who 's giving you the <unk> wives , or the husband who tells you to protect them or keep it safe .
These are n't the things that they want to buy .
So what are you thinking about ?
<unk> !
They sell private companies in these areas .
They do something different .
It may n't have a lot of difference , but it 's different .
And some of the <unk> targets is a huge <unk> of design .
And this is inspired me to think about the <unk> of the church , and it 's about knowing who your customer is .
Unfortunately , their clients are not working on these people who are now jobs .
These are people who are leading people in the back .
But what if we really need to get rid of the spread of AIDS , then we 're going to think about the people who need it to change the behavior of it -- marriages , young women -- thinking about all the people who have a living .
So the question : what 's the important thing you 're going to do is you do n't want to think about who you are and who is to make them change ?
Maybe this could save their lives .
Thank you .

In the summer of this summer , Hans Russell <unk> his magical data data to break the <unk> of the developing world . A renewed mating and China and then aid the world for the new world , and aid it .
development , education , medicine , productivity , science , technology

Hans Rosling : Let 's make data .
I 'll talk about you .
Look at your <unk> and my data ?
If you do n't , one of them needed to upgrade , right ?
When I was talking to my students about the world , I hear them talk about what they 're talking about . They 're going to talk " We " and " them . "
And then when they go back to the class , I ask them , " What do you say that we are " ? "

" We learned in college . "
So what is the definition ? "
Everyone knows , " They said .
But you know , I 'm telling them to do this .
So , a girl said , very smart , " This is very simple .
The West is a huge lifespan in a poor country .
There is a short lifespan in the developing world . "
I like this definition because it allows me to go to my data .
There you have data .
And you can see that this is the size of the family . Every woman has one , two , three , four children in this room .
In here , it 's the length of life , and 30 , 40 , 40 , 50 .
This is the world that I have in the world .
And this is also about the <unk> .
Men and women decided they could create a small family , whether they 're going to care about their kids , and their lives .
It 's about the <unk> and the Kitchen , and if you have <unk> , water and food , you can survive .
The students are right . It 's not the world 's existence -- the World Wide world is here , a group where they have a big family and a very short lifespan .
And then we have a group of countries that are Western .
They have smaller families .
And then you see what 's going on here , that 's in the world .
The developing world uses <unk> and water , vaccine .
And all of the developing countries are used to use <unk> .
There 's also a part of the United States who helps to make decisions and investing .
And you can see that all of the families in the world are moving up to the two kids , and they move to 60 to 70 .
But there are many countries here .
And then you can see it in Afghanistan .
We have <unk> . There is Congo .
So we have a country that lives there .
So my question is that all of my students are not born in the year of their teachers .
And when we do , we 've seen this in the world .
Over the week , I was in Washington of Washington , and I could see , even in the United States , there was this wrong concept that they did n't realize that Mexico , China , is richer than America .
Look here , when I move them forward .
There we go .
They 're <unk> . This is Mexico .
These two societies are like the same .
And what you 're seeing here is that the global health account , however , is less than five percent of the population .
This great country , Mexico , the problem is a huge weapon from the north , across the border , and so they have to stop this , because , you know , they 've got a strange relationship with America .
But if I change the <unk> , look , here , I 'm going to put everybody out of it .
This is income . I can put it here .
And then we 'll see a completely different picture .
By the way , I 'm teaching you how to use our website , <unk> , and why do I <unk> this ? Because this is a free device in the Internet .
And I finally put it back in 200 years , and I can go back to 200 years .
I can find the United States here .
And I can show you other countries .
Now I have a million dollars on this <unk> .
Every one of America has 2,000 dollars .
And life expectancy is 35 to 40 years , and it 's the same thing with Afghanistan .
And I 'm going to show you what happens to the world .
This is n't learning history , but in universities .
You can look at me a minute , and you 'll see everything .
You can see these brown bubbles , and those yellow ones are the American , they 're getting richer and more healthy .
Now this is a billion years ago when the rest of the world goes back .
We started . That 's the big flu .
That 's why we fear flu , right ?
We remember it still . Life rate .
And then we came up . Until we 're independent .
Look at you here in China , there 's India , which is what happens .
You can notice that we have Mexico .
Mexico and America is not exactly the same . But they 're very close .
And in this 200 years , to look at America and China , it 's very interesting because now I 'm in Google working on Google , trying to get the software software on Google .
Because it took a lot of time on the time , and my son and wife spent time to develop this .
And my reputation , in <unk> , was learning .
So my two different opinions , you know ?
My son , the tiniest part of the church , in China , has a long idea .
At the end of the month , he had to develop success in <unk> , or six months of development .
Or Google is very <unk> , so he can have a year or two .
But in China , what you 're looking at is the generation of generations , because they remember that 100 years of history , they 're going to return back .
And they remember the beginning of the last century , and we called it <unk> .
But in <unk> .
And he ended up calling health to China , and then you die . And then it 's starting to start this amazing improvement .
Is n't that weird ? This is the United States beginning to increase the economy , and slowly slowly change .
And yet China is going to be very healthy , because they 're using education , nutrients , nutrition , they use penicillin and vaccines .
This is the economic development of the continent , and there 's a economic growth .
So for me , a public health professor , you do n't feel weird about these countries .
Because what you see here is this flat world of Thomas <unk> , right ?
That 's not really true .
But those are the high - income countries that I 'm going to tell you about the <unk> of the developing world .
Because for all the time , the developing world is like the American history of two parts .
And the last part of the project is about the president , Obama . Another part is what 's going on in the past . When you bring from the beginning of the <unk> era to <unk> .
Because from Washington to <unk> , this is what we call the developing Revolution .
We can actually go from <unk> to <unk> , which is the entire world . That 's the right approach to the city , and we have entrepreneurs , but we also have <unk> countries .
So how do we better understand this ?
Well , one of them is to look at the distribution of the income .
This is the distribution of population distribution in the world , from one dollar , which is where you start to eat .
These people are hungry for sleep .
Here 's the number of people .
This is 10 dollars , no matter whether you have a public or personal health system , and this is where you 're going to start to serve your family , for your kids , to provide school schools . It 's <unk> .
This is East Asia . South Asia is this <unk> .
And this is the change in the world .
It 's changed like this .
How do you see how to grow up ? You see the amount of revenue that goes into the Asia ?
And then it goes here .
And here 's my projections for the future , but I have to stop my brothers , because ...
That 's what the world will do .
And it will remain like this .
But the usual thing is that we have a world that ca n't be separate .
We have these high - income countries in this country as <unk> , and we have emerging economies in the middle , giving us the foundation of money . And we 've got a trillion dollars here .
Well , the cost of our aid is to come from these places . In the last decade , they 're all <unk> .
And here we have a trillion countries , and there are plenty of entrepreneurs .
This is the state of war in war , like Afghanistan , <unk> , North Congo , Darfur .
These are all happening at the same time .
That 's why it 's so difficult to describe the developing world .
Because it 's a very different story .
That 's why I recommend that we can look at it in other ways .
There 's a huge difference in the country .
I heard you 're in the area .
Here you have sub sub - Saharan Africa , South Asia , East Europe , Canada , Eastern countries , Eastern and Western Europe .
This is <unk> percent of GDP .
This is health and children , and it does n't have to be in Africa . And it 's also surprising to Africa .
But when I separate them together , as I divided them into the National <unk> bubbles , the size of the bubble .
You can see that <unk> and <unk> are completely different .
There 's a huge difference in sub - Saharan Africa .
When I separate the other , it 's the Middle East , East Asia .
You have different sorts of different areas .
Eastern Europe , Latin America , and <unk> countries .
We 're here . We have a divided world .
We ca n't divided them into one part .
This is the beginning of the <unk> era . This is the National Academy of Washington .
This is Lincoln who 's extending them .
This is <unk> will get into the country .
And this is the United States today , right here .
We 've created this country .
It 's now about understanding how to change the world .
And I think I need to make a talk .
And that 's where my job is , the world 's other countries , to try to raise a lot of money for the United States , for <unk> health research .
Many people do n't realize -- it 's not a joke .
It 's really serious .
In this 25 years , since the U.S. government Foundation , we have a very good measure of child mortality , and this is what makes us think about the world .
And this U.S. government , which is doing the biggest effort , has n't done a lot of social useful facts .
And the Internet provides free data to the world . Thank you very much indeed .
The World Bank is in a very nice amount of light , using government and malaria to <unk> data , and then they 're going to sell them for a little bit of profit , which is very inefficient .
But people who work in the World Bank are the best .
They are experts in their heads .
It 's just that we hope we can expand our international plan to solve the international problems .
When this comes out of the data , the United States is the best one .
And that 's not just the mouth of the <unk> of Sweden .
I do n't go to the money , not .
I 'm going to show you what happens to you and what we can do with these data .
Look here , this is the world .
The income here , and then children die .
What happened to the world ?
There 's been a decline in the last 50 years since 1950 , since 1950 .
This is the state of the National Assembly <unk> .
We have a increase in the income .
These are the blue countries associated with <unk> National <unk> .
And we continue . But we still have , of course , in the Congo , and we 've got some of the poorest countries here .
<unk> million people , as we heard today , a new solution .
How fast does this happen ?
Okay , four <unk> of <unk> .
The U.S. government is not using the <unk> of four <unk> of development .
But the important sponsors are <unk> us to measure it , because that 's the only child that we can measure .
We often say that every year we 're going to get four .
Let 's see what Sweden did .
We used to fast fast social progress .
We 're in , 1990 .
In 1990 , Sweden was there .
Same child child mortality , Germany , despite the fact that they are low - income .
They 're beginning to start doing good , they 're going to protect them .
They give kids the vaccine . They have better water .
And they reduce child mortality , and they 're going to die per year . They defeat Sweden .
In the next 16 years , Sweden is also true .
In the United States , Sweden was in Southern Europe .
Go ahead . Again , the U.S. is there .
They have safer water , they give poor food . They kill malaria .
<unk> : They 're much faster than the Millennium <unk> .
This is the third opportunity in Sweden , against this Brazil .
This is the great social progress in Brazil , in the last 16 years , and they 're faster than Sweden .
That 's the world .
<unk> income countries , those emerging economies , they 're in Ramallah .
They 're developing the city , and they get better help .
This is in the <unk> .
And they said , " That 's unfair , because these countries have vaccines and antibiotics , Sweden .
We have to do the same time . "
Okay , I 've got Singapore . I was born in the year .
<unk> percent of children are twice as well .
That 's the most tropical country in the world , a <unk> <unk> .
And we started doing a little amount of time .
But they started building their economies .
They start to invest in social investment . They get rid of malaria .
They have a very <unk> health system that <unk> America and Sweden .
We never think they will win Sweden .
These are the green countries , all over the developing world .
These are yellow classes that are going to start .
These are red countries that do n't do , and their policy needs to improve .
Not simply <unk> .
We really need to find a way to support these countries .
We have to respect the developing world .
We also have to have a unified foundation .
This is a population of income , and this is the poorest of the country .
That 's Africa .
The size of the bubble represents how many people are infected .
You can see the tragedy in South Africa .
About 20 percent of adults are infected .
Even though they have an extremely high income , they still have a huge amount of infections .
But you can also see Africa in the bottom here .
There is no bigger epidemic in Africa .
There 's a number of other people in Africa , five to 10 countries .
And there 's also a very high amount of <unk> .
And I 'm going to show you one of the best countries in Africa , which has the most active economy and a very good mailbox .
They have a very high levels . They 're falling down .
But not so far . Because there is the <unk> of the urgency , so it 's not going to die .
It was n't easy to see . That was the war .
Because here , in Congo , there are wars here .
Here , in Zambia , there is peace here .
But there is no economic recession . There are more <unk> .
If I separate the income in Tanzania , Tanzania are more <unk> than people who are poor than poor people .
And every country is different .
Look at some <unk> in Kenya . They 're very different .
This is what you see .
This is not uncommon to poor poor people . It 's a special situation , probably in some countries in the country , in South Africa or in Africa .
Do n't say that Africa is Africa . Do n't do it .
This is the place . And it 's in every place where it 's going to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to end here . This is a billion billion people we do n't know about poverty .
These are the people who have no mobile phones , or they have n't seen the computer , or they do n't .
This is called <unk> disease , and I spent 20 years in Africa .
This is because of the <unk> of famine , rapid processing <unk> .
This is the equivalent of <unk> in the 1930s .
This is very similar to other nutritional diseases .
It does n't get rich people .
We 've seen it in <unk> .
This is in <unk> , and this is also in Southern Canada .
You never heard this disease .
But <unk> people have a lot of people .
This impacts the world .
In the last two years , in the <unk> region , there are 2,000 people who have paralyzed .
This is an illegal <unk> . From [ [ ] ] <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There 's now no economic problem there . They have a larger problem .
And in a week , the first time , there 's four open lines of Internet Internet .
Do n't worry about the amount of money between the emerging income and the high income countries in the middle of the world , and in peace , in <unk> countries .
There 's also a billion people in this room .
We have to have the concepts of the developing world and the development of the developing world .
We need a new attitude . The world is <unk> . But , but it 's not a thousand years .
They were still poor .
That 's not sustainable . This is not a glamorous force .
But you 're going to continue to get one of the most important powers of <unk> . It 's a very glamorous one .
And at this point there will be a very key role , not the American , but the world .
So you have a very tight name , National National Movement , this is not National <unk> .
It 's the world departments .
And we 're going to give you a look at you . Thank you very much .

Robert <unk> explains how " <unk> and <unk> " is how to interact with collaboration and cooperate , and how we should use it to save the world today .
cooperation , culture , global issues , war
1693
Robert <unk> on dealing with psychology
I have about 18 minutes to convince you that your history is a direction -- like a <unk> . It 's a good thing to do .
So before TED came to the TED conference , there was no moral talk -- the Muslims did n't have the <unk> .
It was n't going to be in Europe .
<unk> have n't won the Palestinian Israeli Israeli / Palestinian conflict .
And I said , well , if you get invited to be invited , I think God does n't have <unk> , and I might say , " Can I say something else ? "
But I was <unk> , okay , so I could just try and try it .
And I have to start to remind you that I 'm interested in a worldview , and it 's hard to understand , even if it 's a <unk> .
And when I say , " I can become optimistic , and I think , I try to make a sense of optimism on this thing , so -- -- that -- if " <unk> " is not <unk> , it 's the most optimistic thing you can get here .
I 'll try everything .
First of all , the history of history is not going to be a lot of <unk> .
So for example , we 're going to look at social structures very clearly , obviously , more complex , more complex than the last 10 years .
In fact , this trend trend , in the beginning , is the <unk> of <unk> , which is the legitimacy of cultural <unk> .
The origin of life , from a cell cell beginning , and then the cells are <unk> .
And they 're going to end up with each other , and they 've got more <unk> and more complex than a form of social interaction .
One of the magic things happened to be a new kind of evolutionary process : culture evolution .
But even more amazing , this evolution of evolution is consistent with evolution -- more complex complexity .
<unk> evolution is <unk> .
Many of you have heard of the word " culture , " and yet , I 'm also concerned about technology , and we start with a small <unk> .
<unk> , until somebody said , why do n't we <unk> the <unk> ?
And this is a huge deal of people who are much more conservative .
Another example , TV game .
It looks like a lot of great things , but technology is a continuous process , so we 've got <unk> , we have powerful <unk> .
Technology evolution is also a rapidly acceleration , so 250 years later , we have this .
And there it is .
I 'm sorry -- this joke is cold , I just want to find a way of thinking about <unk> , and I thought , " <unk> can help . "
The <unk> of the world , the <unk> , projected the secret of <unk> .
First of all , let 's look at how social social systems evolve today .
At first , it was a complex , hunting and hunting village .
And then this is the chief social community , the <unk> -- <unk> , in the temple , appeared that agriculture , it 's a lot of military groups that have a military population .
As the invention of writing , the city emerged , and this relationship seems to be a little bit more <unk> , but I 'm really like the evolution of a single type of coat organization that I 've told you , that the organisms are evolving today .
I have to say that social organization is no longer political <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to China .
We saw the same social properties in <unk> , even though it 's different . There are many countries .
But obviously , all sorts of organizations and institutions are beyond <unk> .
This image shows the Earth as well , and I think it 's very beautiful .
<unk> a <unk> .
Now , I 'm going to explain " <unk> " and " effects . "
Think about some people who have n't seen read data , in zero and 54 , <unk> , a winner .
Not zero sum , this relationship can be won .
Like in <unk> , usually 47 percent is always zero , but you 're in the middle of the mailbox , and you have to stand up at the same time with you , so you interact with your <unk> and play .
You always do n't know , <unk> .
In terms of economics and kindness and openness to <unk> .
And what I want to say is that <unk> and openness remained part of our life .
In the age of human hunter , there are no zero and openness - to - peer technologies , but as technology progress , new technologies are evolving , and it 's going to depend on non - zero and openness - <unk> .
In order to change this probability , social structure change , to ensure that we have this kind of <unk> , the city that you know about , and you 're not familiar with non - zero and openness - play , you might not realize about safety and play .
For example , when you 're on a car , how many people in the continents are spreading in this car ? These are the people who are <unk> and play .
And obviously they are .
In some sense , this is actually a very , very <unk> worldview , because when you 're talking about <unk> , what you think is the end result , and that 's good , but it 's not so optimistic , but it is also it that 's not true .
First of all , it does n't have the presence of <unk> wars .
And there 's a deeper reason why , because <unk> and openness , it allows you to result , or whatever it is , or whatever it is .
It ca n't compromise the final result .
So , what do I have to do with the whole thing ? The answer is , first , the first one , I think people are always going to get a lot more <unk> outcomes , and I think that a lot , in non - zero and conservatives , is right .
In this case , there 's an amazing <unk> , which is very encouraging , and it 's really encouraging me : that it has a moral dimension , it can see the moral level of morality .
<unk> money , the people who are in the Greek , thinks that other Greece will be waiting for them to do it , and they 're going to change the way that the moral Revolution .
It 's only about <unk> people who are waiting for them .
But this is at least a progress -- it 's a little <unk> for the bank , and today , this progress is even bigger . I think , most people in this room , all of the people who are going to recognize the world , but most of them are <unk> , because they 're all <unk> .
You should be able to read <unk> , and then you can understand how it 's a revolution . This idea is n't accepted , I think , because the human population , hundreds of years ago .
It 's a difference to justice , race and religion , and it does n't work . If you ask me , why I do n't support the bomb , if I say that because of the Japanese , it 's half - <unk> .
There 's a kind of <unk> and relationship that we do , and I think this relationship is really <unk> us to respect each other , because other people are related to the benefits .
I think this is a moral formula for <unk> .
Unfortunately , I 'm going to sit down with the <unk> <unk> company , and it 's not too much known to understand other engineers , but I suppose , in <unk> , you do n't hear a lot more about race , because , at the end of the day , the people who sit up in the world , they 're not saying , well , there 's no economic <unk> -- and I think that in this sphere , it does n't want to be <unk> in these people , so that it ca n't be the
When we go into a global institution , we have to confront morality .
That 's fantastic .
Now , go back to the museum of <unk> .
Well , you might be wondering , well , the moral dimension of history -- but how to explain the conflict between different civilizations ? First of all , I 'm going to take a look at the relationship between the Muslim world and the <unk> , and if we look in the world , it does n't have to be more powerful than the West , but if they 're more happy , there 's no more <unk> than that .
So this is a <unk> and <unk> .
This mechanism , because of technology , this <unk> and <unk> , will be more powerful than the negative .
They 're the fate of the future , and they 're going to make a difference to negative pain .
I call it <unk> effects .
<unk> <unk> are probably going to be much more powerful in the United States , and there 's a lot of <unk> violence to the U.S.
And I think this is probably possible for me to continue to accept -- because that 's why the <unk> of technology , biology and nanotechnology are still used to be used in <unk> .
We often hear new technologies in the military .
And what I 'm particularly interested in is that this <unk> will cause a feedback cycle for us .
And my idea is that terrorists have gone ; our response is too big .
And we 're not so comfortable with terrorists , which is that it enables us to be more <unk> , and we can make <unk> terrorists .
And when we 're <unk> , our response is much more important , and this is the human nature , a vicious cycle .
And you can call the positive effects of negative emotions , and I 'm really afraid that we should n't use that word , even though it 's a term .
So let 's call the death rate of negative emotions .
And I 'm going to say that once this effect is happening , it 's the West , the Western world and the Western world .
So what do we do ? First of all , we 're going to do something more than <unk> control , or whatever it is .
And I want to tell you a little bit about how it 's going to be the whole planet , but I do n't think there 's no way to do it .
I think the new moral change is going to start .
I think different groups -- different sorts of <unk> , religion , anything that has a different population , and they will reduce the behavior of the <unk> .
All right , I have to admit that I 'm a little bit boring to me .
And I was like , " Why do n't you do that ? "
But I 'm going to show you that I have no choice .
<unk> evolve .
The <unk> of the world has to get less , because the world is so unpredictable .
It <unk> , but I 'm still going to maintain myself , even a lot of <unk> .
That means -- -- Thank you , thank you . That is , remember , I tell you all the moral benefits of self - interest .
And when people are connected to each other .
And when you 're more interested in my interests , then , well , I 'm absolutely <unk> for you . This is morality , and it 's a moral drive . And we 're going to do a lot of <unk> .
And we 've seen this change again .
So these two aspects -- people notice that this is relevant , and they 're going from their own benefit -- to try to see the moral effects .
And so this is why I 'm going to increase the risk of <unk> , " <unk> " and " risk " -- that 's worth happy .
That 's all I 've done . All right .
I never call myself " <unk> <unk> . "
I do .
All right , moral evolve , right ?
What do you do ?
And my answer is , all of us .
We come from beginning to start . As a American man , our kids have 10 years , 20 years of security , and the beginning of my mind -- I 'm personally <unk> -- trying to understand why the world stops us .
I personally think this is a very important project .
And basically , this is a smaller exercise for a moral <unk> .
Because the people who want to understand these different sorts of people -- these people are just the alien -- they 're going to think about a strange way of thinking about it , and in this strange sense , it 's a big achievement , you have to <unk> their experience with you .
It 's true to understand , " Ah , I 've learned .
And so when they feel ashamed , I feel like a lot of fun . " That 's real understanding .
And I think you should be able to understand this .
And when you hate each other , it 's particularly difficult to do , right , because nobody 's willing to be trying to figure out why people hate you .
And I mean , of course you want to know why , but you do n't want to connect with each other .
You do n't want to acknowledge it , right ?
You do n't want to say , " OK , well , I understand why , why a person in the environment would hate me to hate the country . " And I think we have to adapt a whole range of things , but I 'm going to talk about it , and I want it to be <unk> .
It 's only to understand why they hate us , we can make them hate , right , when we use this moral force , to really understand their humanity , they can learn what they 're doing .
That 's the first step . This is what it takes for a long time to accomplish .
Some people know that , you know , a few days ago , I 've been documenting by the National Movement in the country .
And what I did was I was <unk> , and I said , " <unk> <unk> . "
The good news is , at least the <unk> people are Annie <unk> .
And if you have a little bit of that , you 've got to look at it .
They 're not glamorous . They try to understand terrorists , causing a certain sense of compassion , allowing it to become more difficult .
But I think that choice is not going to understand , it 's a much bigger mistake , but we ca n't get soldiers to kill terrorists .
And I do n't really care about it . So -- I mean , we have to do something more much more comfortably , when we 've succeeded -- then , <unk> and <unk> will be accepted once , and we 're going to get into a new level of levels that will go into new levels .
<unk> , saving , higher <unk> , save the world .
If you look at this word in the Bible -- we 've been familiar with the way that compassion uses the uses of compassion -- save violence -- it 's actually a interpretation of the term .
<unk> in the Bible , the most primitive thing , is to save social systems .
" The Lord of the <unk> is our <unk> , " " he 's <unk> the Israeli . "
Now , the whole planet is a social organization , so I suppose , if I say I can give you the good news , you can save the world .
It 's hard . But we 're going to try and try , because we ca n't get it anymore .
Thank you .

Martin Ritchie and you talk about psychology , psychology is a professional , and can also be between the <unk> of the patient , in the study of disease , where modern psychology can help us ?

Martin <unk> talks about positive psychology
When I was in the United States of psychology , people were trying to train me how to deal with the media , and I 've done this experience in CNN that I 'm going to talk about what I 'm going to talk to you about today .
And the editor of the <unk> show us 10 reasons that I 'm going to tell you about 11 .
And the people in CNN found me , and I said , " <unk> professor , you can not talk about psychology .
We want to interview you . I said , well , okay .
And she said , " But this is CNN , so you can only tell you a little bit about it .
And I said , well , what can I tell you ?
She says , " A word . "
And then the camera <unk> , and she said , " How do <unk> <unk> innovation evolve ?
Okay .
Stop , stop that .
We should make a little difference .
So I can tell you a couple of words , and I 'll see , you know , two words .
<unk> : How does the <unk> evolve ?
" No . "
Listen to me , Dr. <unk> , we know that you do n't adapt to this media .
We decided to give the foot .
And you can say three things here .
<unk> <unk> : How does psychology evolve ?
That 's not good enough , but that 's what I want to talk about today .
I want to talk about why psychology is good , bad and psychology .
And I also want to talk about technology and design , because this field of development is similar .
So why is it about psychology ?
Because in the last 60 years , psychology has created a disease model .
And 10 years ago , I 'm going to tell you about the door , and I tell them about my career , they 're going to die from me .
And because they think , well , the goal of thinking about psychology is to find out where you have problems .
Now if I tell people my career , they think so quickly .
Now , the <unk> of the state of psychology , in the U.S.
And now there are three types of <unk> that can be treated with these two .
Another thing is that a scientific field has developed a research disorder .
We found that we can measure the <unk> of depression , apathy , <unk> .
We can engineer mental <unk> .
We can understand <unk> <unk> .
We can look at some of the people in a long - term <unk> , like a number of people on the gene , and we want to know the role of functional and adaptability , that we can separate in this mental experiment .
The best thing is , in the last 50 years , we 've invented medicine and <unk> .
And we can do it with the <unk> control experiment , and it 's going to take a lot of work out of it .
And the result is that , in the last 60 years , psychology and military research really can reduce pain .
I feel very proud , I think .
But this also brings bad things like this .
One is the moral psychologist and the architect of <unk> as romantic , <unk> us to think of people in front of disease .
We forget people are going to make choices .
We forget people are responsible , this is the first cost .
<unk> lose is us .
We forgot to improve normal lives .
We forgot to be happier and more <unk> , more powerful , smart , <unk> .
They did n't study the genius .
The third problem of disease models is that we 're trying to help alleviate people , we turn to <unk> damage , and we do n't think that they 're going to move forward , <unk> , positive interventions .
That 's bad .
And because of that , Doug Engelbart , Michael <unk> , I 'm going to go to work on this area called " positive psychology , " which is three targets for three goal psychology .
The first is that psychology is not necessarily about paying attention to the values of people .
It 's not just about trying to refine harm , but it 's also participating .
It should be interested in the best of life .
They 're supposed to be even better at looking at the lives of the patient , " <unk> , " and " <unk> . "
We want to make positive psychology in the future for the past 10 years , as a scientific outgrowth of what makes life possible to make life better .
Research has found that we can measure different forms of form .
Every single one of you can go to the site and do all kinds of happiness and test all the happiness tests .
You can look at yourself , and you can see , you know , <unk> , happiness , " <unk> . "
We 've created the standard of <unk> and <unk> , and we 're dealing with the strengths of human beings and the benefits of the human mind , their definition , the way that they 're in their roots and their <unk> .
We found that we could find a relationship between positive effects associated with <unk> activity and the brain activity .
I 've spent a lot of pain in my life , and I always want to know a little bit about the difference between the people who have a different amount of pain ?
We asked about six years ago .
How many people who are happy with people ?
It turns out only one difference .
They do n't seem to be more religious , and they 're not even better than others , but they are n't even more successful than anyone else , or their lives .
The only difference they do is they get very good .
They do n't like to go to <unk> mornings .
And they 're rarely impressed .
They have a lot of friends in romantic romantic love .
But careful , these data is just connected to each other , rather than <unk> , and their happiness is a <unk> happiness .
And I 'll tell you , that 's not enough .
From <unk> <unk> , people were in the last century .
From all sorts of ways , it 's about 120 percent of what it means to make people happy .
We can be able to calculate the <unk> that we 're going to do , and we can study the <unk> of these interventions .
And that means , what do you really need to get really happy to raise happiness ?
And I 'll tell you about the results .
In <unk> people , people who do n't reduce pain in pain , they need to be more happy to make people happier .
And I do n't use the word " happiness , " but I 'm going to ask the question that we have to <unk> happiness .
And I think there are three different kinds of happiness that they 're looking at because they come from different sorts of interventions , and people are able to have one of them .
The first is the synthesis of happiness .
In this kind of life , you do n't have to get more emotional emotion , and you 're not able to increase the skills that those emotions are .
And the second is participating , and you 're trying to work and work with kids , <unk> , kid , leisure , time .
And she talked about this life .
The third is something that is meaningful .
And I think it 's easy to talk about three years of life .
The first is the life of the music , where you have the joy of happiness , and you 're not able to get happier , you can zoom in and learn happy skills in time and in space .
But the life of happiness has three people who are interested in this , and this is the place where the positive psychology is <unk> .
The first is that the first time you can feel that you feel about 50 percent of the variation in the gene .
So Matthew and I , in the other hand , are using people who are more <unk> , and 15 to 20 percent of them are going to make people scaling up the range of <unk> .
The second knob is that they can adapt very quickly to adapt .
It 's like <unk> <unk> , and it 's 100 percent of the crap , but there 's no noise .
<unk> , as I said , is hard to change .
So let 's start talking about the second life .
I have to tell you about my friends , <unk> , that you know that positive psychology is n't just about understanding the happiness .
In the early age of 30 , the two in the <unk> is the first one in three different areas .
It 's about 20 years old ; he 's a <unk> .
It 's not about 25 years old , and he becomes a <unk> - <unk> company .
The second is dance : he 's national champion .
But in third aspect of love , love is completely lost .
And that 's why he 's very obsessed with people .
Yves bears .
When he was eight years old , they said , " No , no , you do n't have a ticket ; you do n't wake up .
Luckily , there 's enough money to ask about the best of the better psychology and think about five years of <unk> <unk> , trying to figure out what 's going on .
But you ca n't find it .
In fact , <unk> is grown up in New York , and he 's playing football , looking at rugby games , watching the <unk> of the football game .
<unk> : Is n't that happy ? I do n't think he was happy .
It 's about 50 billion people who are interested in human emotions , and I think that 's one of the most happy people I 've ever seen .
And he did n't feel very happy about it , because most of them are very , very good .
When he was in the morning at the end of the day , when he went to the U.S.
When he started <unk> , it seemed to stop , until 10 days later .
This is <unk> <unk> , which is very different from the regular happiness .
When you 're happy , you feel happy .
But Michael told you what it is , and you ca n't feel it .
You 've got a lot of music in your face .
You 're very focused on attention .
We think that this is the characteristics of <unk> .
We also think that it 's a good thing to do , and that 's what the biggest benefit you have .
Well , there 's a <unk> test that goes out of your largest five .
And then it 's going to try to form more and more of it .
Your job . Your love , your commitment , you have a way of doing .
One example : I 've studied a <unk> <unk> in the store .
She does n't like this job .
She also read university .
And her biggest advantage is to be good , so she 's very hard to let everyone meet her day .
She was obviously paralyzed .
But she was doing her best to work on her work .
You 're not smile .
You do n't look at <unk> <unk> .
You do n't cry for <unk> ; you get more <unk> .
This is the second path , the first path is <unk> .
The second path is " happiness . "
<unk> is meaning .
This is the most glamorous part of happiness .
And as the second path , the meaning of what you 're going to know is that you have to understand where you are , and to use them , you 've got to find a sense of commitment .
And I talked about three lives of life , and the life of happiness has to be meaningful , people who want to know that there is something to change our lives ?
And the answer is , yes , a few examples .
We do it very well .
And so what we 're doing is that the <unk> works .
We have a random amount of <unk> on <unk> , and we use all sorts of interventions .
Think about what 's going to happen , what we 're trying to do is to introduce a lot of happiness to live in life , and one of your mission to be able to design a good day for your careful and conservatives .
<unk> up the next panel , a good day of <unk> and <unk> , to increase these happy <unk> .
We can prove that so happy that happiness is really improved .
Another intervention is compassion , and if you want to , please join me .
eye eyes .
And I 'm going to remember you a little bit about an important direction to change your lifetime , and you never have anyone who has n't heard of it .
You have to be a <unk> person .
Now , good , <unk> .
And I want you to find one person out there .
And you 've got to give you a note to this mission to call them a $ 300 person who says you 're going to sit and visit them , and do n't say why , you know , they 've read a little bit about it -- everyone 's <unk> <unk> .
One week later , after a month , three months later we tested this , and we found these people getting happier , less depressed .
Another example is the actual date of the <unk> , and we 've found that the best advantage for them is that they 're very important in the test , but then we 're designed to design a single evening for them to be able to do something that can be <unk> .
<unk> is a method for charity .
This is a way to do that , because many of you are already struggling with charity .
Anyway , I do n't know what to do with my test in my university , and I 'm going to give them a little bit more interesting .
You 'll notice that when you do fun , pleasure quickly quickly .
And when you 're dealing with people who help others , happy feel longer .
These are the examples of the positive .
And the second thing that I want to say is that we 're very interested in how much people are optimistic about their lives .
This is what we 're looking for .
And what we 're seeing here is the interaction of three different sorts of lives that you have in your life ?
And we studied tens of thousands of people in the 15 <unk> , and we want to know , right ?
Turns out that result result .
Research shows that the <unk> of happiness is fundamentally affecting our life .
It 's the biggest influence of what it is .
It 's a huge achievement for participation .
And if you 've been involved in engagement and meaning , pleasure can be <unk> .
It means that if all of you have all sorts of lives , there 's a whole range of life .
Instead , if all of you do n't have life , it 's much more than anything .
What is the same thing that we 're going to ask now is that the health care lives , the productivity , or whether it 's the same thing ?
Do you know what productivity is in a company , <unk> and purpose ?
Are health and joy and values ?
We have a reason for all of us to think .
And Chris said that the last speaker had the opportunity to hear the <unk> that he heard , and I never had a <unk> party .
I 've never seen this very impressive show of presenting music .
But I found that psychology is very similar to the question that technology and entertainment and <unk> face .
For example , we all know that technology and entertainment and design can be used as conservatives , and they do that .
We know that technology and entertainment and design can be used to reduce pain .
By the way , the lack of pain and the creation are the difference between the <unk> and the difference .
When I was 30 years ago , I thought , if I had the ability to get rid of the risk of depression , the anger of anger , I 'm happy to get them happy .
And the truth is , it 's not the best , it 's the best part of the patient .
But they 're in their hearts .
In fact , the skill of happiness and happiness is the skills of <unk> , to find sense of meaning and low pain skills that are different .
And I think that the same thing is in technology , Entertainment and design .
That means that three forces can be used for people to increase people 's happiness and play .
But if you get happy as me , you 'll find happiness that happiness is not just about <unk> -- that 's not enough -- the meaning of life .
<unk> tells us that design and entertainment and technology can also be used for meaning and purpose .
So , for example , in the concept of <unk> , the <unk> of the space of space - to - art is that we can use technology , entertainment and design and increase the human happiness on the planet .
If technology can increase the lives of the next decade or 20 years of life , people are happy to participate in life . It 's good enough .
If the entertainment is increasing , and the joy , the happiness , it 's good enough .
And if you do that , you can do a lot of fun , and that 's what we 're doing with the rest of the world , and that 's all we do . Thank you very much .
<unk>
In this particular talk , journalists <unk> to rethink the question of African problems -- <unk> , civil war , wars , despair and despair , all kinds of opportunities in the continent .
Africa , business , development , global issues , investment , philanthropy , politics , technology
<unk>
The other ones are looking for Africa .
And I 'm very , very happy , so that these lights are very noisy , and they 're on my ceiling .
And so I 'm honored to be honored and creative , creative people .
I 've heard about three people 's talk before you think about what happened ?
And every one of the things I want to say is that I have n't seen anything that can say .
But in my <unk> , there 's a saying that if you lose a license , it does n't say that it 's going to leave the tree .
So , since I 've had no excuse to say a little bit about me .
We 're in a very hierarchical age , because the other conference is in Berlin .
This is the eight - year - old <unk> .
<unk> <unk> suggests that the way to deal with the African problems is to continue to save Africa that is similar to Africa .
Unfortunately , I do n't believe it 's a priority .
First of all , <unk> is <unk> .
It 's the largest Swiss and France , but it 's only about two percent of the GDP of their GDP .
And in the average country , the foreign aid of the country has gone up to 90 percent of their GDP -- 15 percent , so that 's a unprecedented fund from a wealthy country to poor countries .
But what I want to say is that there are two things that we need to talk about .
This is how the Western media reported Africa and those aid .
By playing despair and compare images of the world , it is a real real theory of what Africa is .
And yet , media does n't tell us all the truth .
Because despair , civil war , famine , despite the fact that we 're truly part of Africa , but these are n't all true .
And they 're just part of it .
There are <unk> countries .
There are only six countries that have a civil war that says , " Well , media is just saying this six or six countries .
There 's a huge opportunity in Africa , never reported in reports of despair and despair , so that the West , the Western media , has brought them to their audiences .
But those stories are just <unk> compassion .
Ask compassion , pray for them .
And the result is that the history of Western Europe is established by the <unk> of Africa .
And the idea of this idea is to think of a state of despair .
What do we do ? We should be hungry for hungry .
We 're going to send people for sick people .
We need to have <unk> to save people who are struggling .
In this process , Africa has lost its own <unk> .
And I want to say , well , the important thing is to recognize that Africa is really <unk> .
But there 's also a lot of <unk> .
We need to retool Africa in a lifetime of despair , which is called <unk> , and it 's called <unk> - <unk> .
We redefined it to a hope of hope .
All of the people who care about Africa are going to look at this test , not a reduction .
It should be a social test .
Once we have to exchange these two concepts , if you say , " Africa , they need <unk> . "
For the poor people to go to the <unk> , the people who get hungry to get people to get to the civil war .
All of these did n't fundamentally solve because of the fundamental problems of Africa .
You send people to school , and they sell them , you do n't give them .
The cost of stability is the fundamental value of <unk> , and stability comes from a trade - effective opportunity or a stable job .
Now , we 're starting to talk about how to make a wealthy challenge , and the next challenge is to be a social remix .
It 's an entrepreneur , and it tells us that they 're always the <unk> of the world , but the 16 percent is not real entrepreneurial .
But they can also be entrepreneurs .
So what should we be doing ?
We need to use money to make money .
Support to the private investment in Africa , whether it 's GDP .
<unk> <unk> , because knowledge is the part of the value .
But what about the international aid organization ?
They took money to the foundation , and they spent a lot of money on the base , and they 're going to feed .
The whole continent has become a kind of fight and a struggle for interest .
Ladies and gentlemen , you can tell me your neighbor , your friends and the advertisers .
It 's a prescription by the passenger <unk> of the other person .
How many of you have heard of this .
How many of you have heard about a nation - by - a - <unk> and brave <unk> ?
All right , since I did n't see somebody on the hands , I said that .
<unk> : Yeah , I heard the word " <unk> , " which he knows there .
Which country ?
<unk> : That 's a <unk> of <unk> , and I 'll tell you .
<unk> can only give you an opportunity .
How can you grab this opportunity to become an advantage to your personal capabilities .
Africa had a lot of opportunities .
But most of us do n't pay attention .
Why ? Because the <unk> of our lack of <unk> and policy laws to help us benefit from our relationship . I can give you an example .
And according to <unk> <unk> , it 's a great opportunity to get Africa to Africa , a good opportunity for <unk> goods to Europe .
My <unk> , Uganda , had a chance to <unk> five million dollars into the European system .
We do n't <unk> the <unk> .
We went from the Brazil to get five million tons of <unk> .
Secondly , for the second time , this <unk> of broccoli is a country that has a lot of resistance to the <unk> , which is <unk> beef .
There 's no country in Africa , the most successful country of Africa .
So what I want to say is that Africa is fundamentally <unk> and other countries building a efficient relationship , because it does n't have good relationships and policy structures .
And all sorts of changes have required to support the development of sustainable institutions and to improve efficient institutions .
How do we do that ? Why do n't help me ?
You know why help help be a good thing ?
Because all the government needs money to keep it .
Think about the laws of law and advertisers need money .
<unk> military and police to maintain law and order , it needs money .
And because of most of the authorities , what most governments need is that they really need to use military <unk> .
And then the political activities require money .
Why should people go to support their government ?
And that 's because governments can make a good job in Africa , in many African countries .
The truth is , there 's no government in the world , except for a handful of people like <unk> , it 's used to be used for force .
A lot of countries in the world need to make their <unk> <unk> .
And the government , the authorities , they need to provide <unk> - sharing , road , building hospitals and clinics .
How a government of government depends on whether it 's going to get more money from the people , so that they 're <unk> in a much larger way .
It will sit and sit down .
And what the policy that they talk about , what they 're talking about is they continue to increase the business of business , and it 's going to get a lot of money from they get to get more <unk> from them .
The problem in Africa is the question of aid , which is that it <unk> self - stimulation , where the African countries have to confront this problem .
The main foundation of our government is not about the GDP of the country , but from the international aid .
And instead of working with Uganda , it 's not about the entrepreneurs of Uganda who sit down to the <unk> of the U.K. and Ghana , South Africa , which we found in our government and the World Wide Web .
I want to say , even if you have 10 <unk> , you do n't think more about <unk> than Bill .
Why ? Because you need to understand the amount of knowledge that 's required to increase the business of things that need you to listen to .
So all of the governments in Africa have a chance to do a good job in the International Society of <unk> , and so that allows us to start with the <unk> of a <unk> and the World Wide Web , the U.S. World Bank -- and then the Middle World -- what do they need ?
In this whole process , the <unk> of Africa is completely ignored from the policy of the state of our country , and it 's been ignored by the strategies of policy .
We have to limit , because the police are paid .
<unk> and World Bank and the World Wide Web are already losing us as civic rights , because the government depend on aid , so they 're doing what they are doing , not their GDP .
But I want to give you a little bit of help and not .
Some aid used to be building the hospital , aid hungry .
Building the road , that road might have been a good job .
And the mistakes of international aid is to look at those <unk> examples of success , and hundreds of dollars of money in the world are going to spread around every single village that has been elected every village , which is a very different skill , the <unk> and the habits that make it work , just like <unk> , that <unk> the experience of the church , <unk> that experience .
And aid has increased resources for the government to become the most profitable , especially for a poor Africans who are seeking work .
Because the increase in the political <unk> of the country is particularly the world of a race of romantic Africa , which is often <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and every race can see that the <unk> is about 180 percent , to get the foreign aid .
Ladies and gentlemen , the most glamorous people in Africa ca n't find public trade and work , because <unk> and <unk> are all against <unk> .
The government does n't change that , which is why ?
Because they do n't need to talk to them .
They talk about the International <unk> .
So there are <unk> Africans who ended up in the end of the government , and this has increased the political flexibility , because we depend on aid .
And I want to say that in the last 50 years , it 's more important to get more money from the international world , and the amount of aid is really important for us , including technology , in the last 50 years , and all kinds of aid and all kinds of aid .
In Europe , in 2003 , Africa had six <unk> aid , and we were still told that there was still poverty in Africa .
Where does this help ?
I want to use my country -- Uganda , as an example , to see how to do it .
In 2006 , in 2007 , the cost of productivity is 2.5 trillion <unk> .
We expect growth - to - income ratio aid .
The everyday cost of Uganda in Uganda is that it 's everyday .
It 's only about <unk> trillion dollars .
Why do you spend a lot of money in the U.K. government budget ?
Because the International aid aid is in help .
But here you see Uganda that did n't intend to use their money to make good money , but in this sacrifice , for the price of the economy as a public organization .
This is <unk> , and it 's <unk> billion .
The military , the <unk> billion .
It 's a very poor sub - Saharan Africa that has been done about 180 billion .
The trade - ups of trade , <unk> , <unk> .
So I 'm going to tell you what the public costs are in Uganda , something that is public <unk> .
Let 's see , 70 percent of the founders of <unk> , <unk> <unk> said , who does n't see the president , who does n't see his president .
And when you really see him , it must be a public , but that 's what they recommend .
Our local government had <unk> departments .
Each of the <unk> structures in the government is a systematic system , a <unk> , an <unk> government , and a church government provides so much work .
And then there 's been 23 years old , and when our president wants to change the institution , he 's going to increase his <unk> , then he enhances 25 million dollars , right now .
<unk> <unk> .
You need a " <unk> <unk> " looking at our Congress .
The <unk> committee and the half of the <unk> authorities , all of these institutions , have all these <unk> and automotive cars , and finally let us turn to <unk> , who 's going to help us .
An recent study of research in Uganda shows that there are 3,000 cars being used in the museum of <unk> .
There 's a <unk> in Uganda , and every <unk> has a missile that has no Jeep .
Those are the cars that are used in the museum of the Library of Congress , <unk> , administrators and administrators who do n't have the international assistance agencies , because there are no poor people who are dead and medicine .
And finally , I want to tell you that I 'm going to talk to you about the principles of the <unk> principle , which is , a great talk about the Grand Canyon that is <unk> .
It has to be able to attract your interest to the place where you should be <unk> .
I hope I did .
Thank you very much .

As the National <unk> Foundation , David <unk> believes that photography has a force , allowing us to connect with the world that we live in , and through a series of glamorous films , he tells us how to use photos .

David <unk> : A photography of photography
Let 's start with some great photography of photography .
This is one of the leading effects of <unk> <unk> in Afghanistan .
Listen to the magazine of Harvard magazine , I will not imagine what they 're going to do .
Maybe it would be <unk> .
This one 's swimming in San Francisco is shot by Bruce <unk> .
And he <unk> the camera to the plane , and he goes on the plane .
This is one of the photos of <unk> <unk> who was shot in a magazine called <unk> .
<unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the Congo
I love this image , which allows me to remember the famous <unk> of <unk> , " Little <unk> . "
Paul <unk> on a polar bear
The polar bears are n't very good at swimming , and they 're more elegant , they all know , but everybody knows where to do it .
These are <unk> - <unk> , Chris Jones .
And the photo is taken from the <unk> , and it 's a <unk> shadow .
This is the <unk> photo of the Sao <unk> singer , and Charlie <unk> is a good man like <unk> .
This is a shot by <unk> <unk> 's work .
This is David Carter who 's taken pictures of a photo in Spain .
And David says something else happened in the <unk> .
But , at least there are more health .
<unk> ice on their own dance with their dance David <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> 's painting by Dr. <unk> .
And the last one , without a short movie , is made by <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
Despite the media of the Media Revolution , the camera is still going to have its own power camera , which is a way to show that our minds are <unk> .
Tell you a real story .
After four years ago , I went with my kids to play the <unk> , and he was starting to learn about swimming seals , not too big .
But what I did was I opened up two times a minute of the ocean , and he pulled him down to the ocean and he had his struggle to struggle .
Now , I can still remember the scene of the <unk> , and it 's almost like extending all the time .
And I remember that this is <unk> <unk> .
And there 's a discussion about it .
And he 's filled with my hands on the side of my hand , and it 's all right to me , " Father , <unk> , help me . "
And then I ended up with him .
We went back to shore , despite anything .
But we were scared .
This is a picture of a photo , which is so close to the image of my image , and it 's not just documenting it .
And that 's exactly what photography is about to create a emotional relationship between the audience .
I told you , I 'm going to tell you about the son , and I 'll give you this story .
And he said , " Oh , I remember this .
And I remember that you 're standing in charge of land .
And I thought that this man brought me to hero .
And who knows -- back to the top of the day , what you see here is a series of <unk> photographer , only one exception .
This image is <unk> Dr. <unk> at the end of the year in New Zealand , and released the magazine magazine .
We 've got a new leader in our website last year , " The readers work " and " You can <unk> your photo . "
And this leadership led to a huge success of the <unk> of photography .
<unk> <unk> has always been <unk> in <unk> .
And every time I see these work , it 's a little bit more <unk> that we 've taken a lot of good photos in the world .
But as a great <unk> photo , it 's not enough .
Except that they 're not going to get better than that .
As a professional photographer , the more important thing is to make yourself alive .
<unk> photographer has to know how to use this photo .
So I 'm going to show you a couple of examples of what 's going on here .
And <unk> de <unk> was going to take a very small , low - <unk> <unk> center , <unk> National Park , National Park .
The first motivation was just to walk and shot and took a bunch of <unk> images .
That 's what Nick is doing .
This is a <unk> cat , which is <unk> .
In fact , you can use this as a phrase that says , " This is called <unk> <unk> . "
The camera is a <unk> , and it 's a signal that goes into the camera before it comes to his camera .
Here 's some <unk> .
And Nick <unk> made a shot of thousands of photos .
But mostly <unk> are <unk> .
A <unk> lion looked at it and saw it already .
A <unk> <unk> back back to itself .
And I 'm very interested in it , and I love these <unk> .
But the elephant is the most important species of <unk> National Park .
This is also one of the most <unk> elephants ever .
This is the emergence of a group of elephants that made <unk> easier to make it easy to make a difference .
<unk> changes the entire story .
Nick <unk> and researcher Michael <unk> started to look at those victims of the elephant .
And they called her what she 's doing with the radio record .
In the streets of the park , the elephant in the city , in <unk> , is safe for life .
But when it comes to anti - <unk> , they start in the protected area .
And the tragedy is that <unk> starts .
There 's a number of filaments that are trying to get out of the East , trying to get the opportunity to kill them .
And after a few weeks , the amount of radio bears were in the area of <unk> , and the radio waves were <unk> in the east coast .
<unk> died , and she was killed by 20 members of her community .
And it 's just doing it just for them .
A photo is a <unk> .
They 're not going to go back to a gallery , and they 're just doing these things that they can do , so they 're just going to go back all the time .
But what Nick <unk> is doing is n't the story of a new story that we 're used to .
It 's a story that allows us to wonder .
It 's not just a story about the story , but it 's a understanding of how elephant and their <unk> , and many , many people and other people .
Now we 're going to move into India .
Sometimes we could talk about a big subject .
This is what we see here Richard <unk> 's " <unk> Project . "
The first cities in the history of human history have gone to the village .
Most of these people are not living in rural places , but they live in cities .
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> photographer , and he finds me and said , " We should record this , I think .
Let 's start around the world . "
And I told him , " You know , this need a lot of money to do it . "
And what we decided to do is that instead of thinking about the way that we 're going to take a lot of paper , it 's almost impossible to get rid of the face of Mumbai , which is called <unk> , called the <unk> <unk> in Mumbai .
And the end result is that it 's not just the <unk> of the local <unk> .
And he saw a living <unk> of living , and it 's a normal city , and it 's important .
And by the way , the <unk> of this kind of painting is that it 's going to be in the front of the community .
And he did this .
But it 's also the only way to tell stories .
So for example , we <unk> with the <unk> Foundation and <unk> <unk> , and it 's a story about seasons that are about fishing .
We 're not talking about the only media of this topic , but Brian <unk> 's work is the best influence on the effects of the human and nature <unk> .
This is a photo taken from the <unk> of the Empire State Building on the <unk> Empire .
I 've seen a lot of <unk> from the <unk> of the remote fish when the other fish of a fish fish often goes through .
But then Brian Allen came up with a particular view of what 's going to happen in the bottom of the boat , and he <unk> this photo on the floor .
And this photo is a lot more than Tim risks at the bottom of the sea , and it 's this picture that nobody has ever done before .
So let 's go back to <unk> , looking at the photos of <unk> <unk> 's photos , a <unk> market market for Africa , and they 're going to sell the fish for fish .
This is the <unk> jellyfish jellyfish in China .
And as the main fish population has <unk> , the fishermen are starting to pull their attention to the sea to find a lot of food .
This is smaller than the <unk> of the ocean .
But it 's not completely <unk> that we 're doing something like this , and we do n't have to have a problem with it .
We 're also looking for hope .
This is the photo of a photo that 's taken out of the <unk> , in New Zealand , from a fishing district , which has been <unk> since the species of <unk> species , and that is a solution for sustainable seasons .
We 're going to do something that we do n't want to accept .
Last year at TED U , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the U.S. Air Force , shot a bunch of photos of <unk> Iraq .
And the <unk> system is like a <unk> , and it comes back from one <unk> to the house .
Small <unk> of <unk> came from fighting .
This picture is going to be <unk> by <unk> soldiers from <unk> to <unk> to the <unk> hospital .
This is the picture of the <unk> hospital .
This is also the name of the <unk> in the right side of the day .
<unk> is taken from the hospital hospital , and their family 's family will show up there to meet them and meet them .
And then they went back to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And they ended up with a lot of technical skills , and they 're trying to figure out the <unk> of the hospital and try to figure out what 's going on .
<unk> <unk> gives a <unk> medical story to a medical scientific story , full of human readers .
These stories can tell the story how to be used to tell some of the most profound issues .
But sometimes the <unk> found that it was only romantic .
Paul <unk> once shooting across a <unk> of <unk> leopard seals .
This is a little bit of a picture of some of the themes that people have taken , and partly because people are the most dangerous animal in the ocean .
In fact , a recent study of research was released a year ago , killing the ocean .
So you can imagine Paul 's in the water .
For <unk> seals , the most important thing about the <unk> is to eat the penguin .
You all know " <unk> <unk> . "
If you make <unk> <unk> , maybe it 's a " <unk> " for <unk> .
This is a picture of a penguin that 's safe to fly underwater .
And you can <unk> the surface .
And then Paul goes on .
He was saying he did n't worry .
This is the picture that came to his place .
And this <unk> is about four or four years old , and it 's also in the picture .
She 's really a tall <unk> .
And the reason for Paul was that they were n't afraid that this reputation was over to his curiosity .
This one here is open up on the right , and it 's open to him , " <unk> , you see me beautiful ? "
<unk> is saying , " <unk> , <unk> . "
And then she thought that this guy would think he was poor .
There 's also a <unk> <unk> in the water that does n't know why the penguin is n't .
So she started to feed his penguin , and she put his living penguin on his front .
But as soon as she comes up , those penguin watches immediately .
She looked at him , and she said , " This guy is <unk> . "
And then she 's going to find a few penguins and look at this penguin .
She did it for a few days after Paul <unk> , and she took her penguin directly to his mouth .
So Paul <unk> this funny photo .
Paul thought that it was n't going to be in the sea to starve death .
And then she went on to see this photo , and she did n't get anything .
To his final end , <unk> went home , and why to do it .
And then , slowly , it 's been taken out of the fact that the creatures that are not familiar with the people who are familiar with the people , but it 's a very interesting story , but it 's a fun story .
It 's about a series of stories that <unk> us to actually demonstrate the power of photography .
I believe photography can become a positive force to bring people to the world to see the challenges that everyone can see in our world , to find the hope that we have .
Thank you .

The <unk> graphics of the computer , <unk> <unk> , explaining the figures of what 's going on for us .

Paul <unk> : The face of <unk>
And one of the big challenges of computer graphics is how to make a real <unk> face .
It does n't look like <unk> and dinosaurs , because it 's so difficult for us to see people every day .
The face of faces is very important because we interact with each other .
And the idea is that we 'll notice that these very subtle things are going to be <unk> by the computer , which is probably inappropriate to believe that those are real issues .
In the next five minutes , I 'm going to leave you with a process that 's created by the computer , by creating a character that we developed in a series of computer graphics , and with some partners from <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to try to make a sense of a <unk> called <unk> , where she 's there .
And that 's actually a completely developed picture of the computer 's face .
In the end of the lecture , we 'll see <unk> .
And what we 're trying to do is by <unk> her own , she 's very glamorous from her lab , sitting in <unk> , and sit at the stage of the <unk> in the next five days .
This is a piece of a <unk> scan of the sphere , and there 's a white white light that flows through them , refine it in a series of stars .
We 're using light that looks like this .
We 've taken all these pictures in <unk> .
And we 've taken information from the <unk> of the image , through the images of <unk> , where she has the data on the surface of light , and through a range of different levels of bone , with her physical <unk> model , the model of her <unk> .
And if we look at this photo of this picture , we can see that she 's very close to see her faces , because her face is <unk> from every aspect of each angle , and she does n't have a very high face .
And we 're actually using <unk> on all of these lights , like the purity of the individual , which can be able to make a light that goes on the skin , and then we do n't have the skin <unk> , so we do n't have to collect these high - speed lighting contact , so we do n't have the same amount of speed that 's going to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> those high - <unk> <unk> that we 're not able to get into the fluid , which is very much the high speed of
Now , if we 're a little bit <unk> , we can get the <unk> folding on the skin , and then you 'll see her face , some <unk> and <unk> .
If you take these two images of a bad image , you get the tilt of <unk> , and the sun 's light is <unk> .
And I think none of the images will be done before that .
It 's very important to collect sunlight , because light is going to fold the one layer in the skin .
It does n't happen in the middle of the ice , and it <unk> down .
And so it 's a very good quote to the skin , and the structure of our skin and we have the whole skin of skin that we all have , in fact , that these are the things that make it closer to humans .
If you use , we use the <unk> of the high - speed information that we have in traditional face with traditional <unk> , and then you can monitor large amounts of information <unk> and texture structures and texture structures .
What 's more important is that it 's based on the process of the photo , and we just capture three seconds of data , we can take a whole afternoon in a afternoon .
And here , you can see she rotate her eyes .
These are actually actually being used to create digital <unk> .
And if you look at the scans of this , we see that we 're going to see the face of our human face in different faces .
And you 'll see , not just the <unk> form and all kinds of skin <unk> and the skin .
And you can see that the skin structure has a huge change in the <unk> , from the outside skin , to the normal skin .
You can see the <unk> change there .
You can see that muscle contracts in her <unk> .
She 's going to expand it like this , in her <unk> .
For this high - speed <unk> , because these are captured by camera cameras , we have enough faces .
By the way , through color and <unk> , the colors come in different directions of light , and we can use <unk> to <unk> his skin .
So , unlike <unk> <unk> , she looks like human life .
This is the digital visualization of the <unk> company that we use for <unk> companies .
Here , let 's look at radical geometry .
But they 've made a new set of data about her , and you can <unk> these different levels of scale , it 's actually moving through the data .
And , for this basic model , they also use all of the details to create some of these statements , which can also <unk> it .
Here 's some sweat here .
And you can see different types of <unk> in her animation .
So the next step is <unk> to her .
We actually use her acting as a model .
From the computer technology to analyze these videos , they can drive control by the <unk> of computers .
So , we 're going to see that , through this process , it 's a completely <unk> figures .
We can take a little bit of sound , if you can .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> firm
We 're participating in the face of the high - quality effects of video games and film .
<unk> <unk> is a company called <unk> .
We 're participating in using high - performance responses to the video of video games and film .
Paul <unk> : And if we divided it into all kinds of layers , we saw it in the first slide .
This is <unk> <unk> .
You can see the full layers of the skin .
This is <unk> <unk> .
That 's her own life .
Now , what do we do next ?
We 've had more than five devices that are used in the next five days , and this is the light ceiling , we expect that we 're going to apply this technique to people .
This is Bruce <unk> , and one of the things we 've developed in the team is very , very strong for us to collect data at the stage .
So let 's look at the image of the computer , in a new context , running in an entirely new environment .
Thank you very much .

Josh <unk> talks about the work of <unk> animals in Congo -- and his hero , of his heroes , brought it through <unk> , <unk> and <unk> civil wars .
Africa , activism , animals , biodiversity , biosphere , war
<unk>
<unk> <unk> is a hero of a Congo forest .
I wo n't say English .
I started writing English about a year ago , learning English .
I grew up from fiction , so my English is <unk> English .
And I was born in Congo , and I had a place where it was n't very far from that place .
And then I came up with this , and I came up to this , and I came up with the rain forest .
But I 've always been doing -- at about 14 years old , I was in the nursing parents .
My dad is a soldier , my uncles , and my uncle is an <unk> .
And what I did was I was doing it in 17 and 17 years to get them to collect <unk> and meat , and they sell them in the forest .
But finally , I 'm participating in their actions .
In about 17 to 20 , I became a <unk> .
And what I 've done is that I believe that my school will continue .
I 'd like to go to college , but my dad , uncles , are more telling .
So I did that .
In three years , I went to university .
I was inspired by three times , and I decided to be a doctor .
I had no success .
And I got to my <unk> , and I tried to collect it .
And I said , " <unk> , I 'm not going to die . "
My dad grew up , and I had no good medicine .
I want to be a doctor to serve them .
Three times , three years later , I started growing up .
I said , oh , no , I 'm going to continue .
So the <unk> of the tropical hemisphere and <unk> <unk> .
When I was arrested , I went to <unk> covers .
And that 's where I started working on work , and I 've been doing passion to work in front of what you 're going to do right now .
And at the time , there was a <unk> forest that built a forest that had some animal reserves and plants .
There 's a trained center in the center of some Congo , and some of the U.S. <unk> of the U.S.
So the number of animals in <unk> -- I think there 's one of the most <unk> ones that we 're going to depend on in a Congo region .
There 's a chimpanzee here .
It 's called the <unk> Society , which comes from this beautiful species .
That 's a <unk> <unk> .
I want you to understand it .
This is <unk> <unk> , but in evolution , they just live in Congo .
There 's some <unk> .
There are 13 percent of the biggest places we can find in Africa .
So there 's also a <unk> forest forest itself knows that there are about 130 plants .
I joined the wildlife <unk> in 1995 , but in 1991 , when I was teaching them to work on them .
I was appointed the <unk> of my college , because I got the degree .
But I do n't like to do that kind of stuff .
And I think about training centers and research centers .
And in <unk> <unk> , you know , it 's a very , very difficult thing to know .
Our work can not be done .
When the leopard <unk> started <unk> the Congo campaign , she started traveling and <unk> .
So they started <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of the animal , in which there is a way to go in there , and there 's a path where it comes from here .
So they 're probably going to pass from <unk> animals .
And there 's five of the richest people in the Congo world that are richest , and it 's also one of the richest <unk> of <unk> .
These are <unk> animals in the <unk> .
They 're not doing anything .
<unk> , war -- oh , my God , you do n't believe .
It 's all about looking at things , and we 're not sure .
In particular , the young people in our first generation , we 've got a sense of <unk> .
And even all of the people who did n't have it , they do n't think they 're going to do something about it .
They 're harvesting the <unk> , because they have power .
Who did that ?
Children , kids , <unk> .
You ca n't learn their age because they 're <unk> .
But I came from the West , and I worked in the East .
I wo n't even say the Spanish <unk> .
They <unk> all the stuff .
You ca n't wait for the <unk> , because it 's the language of <unk> <unk> all the time .
And I went from the same place .
All of my friends said , we 're going to leave it , because we 've become a goal .
But I would n't go to Northern Europe because I did n't say <unk> .
I 'm going to leave you . If I get caught .
I could n't go back to my position -- 1,000 miles away .
And I left all of the stuff they did .
We 've been working on <unk> research , we have a little boat sample , and we 've got a lot of dust on top of this .
We <unk> , we cut them , and we put them on a plate .
<unk> -- we can use them to be in the field of medicine , on the weather -- and also the changes in science and across the forests .
That 's some people around the neighborhood , and even <unk> <unk> .
This is a smart guy , <unk> <unk> .
And I worked with him for about 10 years .
They do n't work with soldiers in the forest .
Because he 's <unk> <unk> , he knows how to track elephants in the forest .
He was beaten by the <unk> , and those people would throw him down .
And they came up with me and said to me .
And what I did is I do some of the antibiotics that we used to treat .
Fortunately , <unk> his life .
That 's what wars look like .
All of the people who are growing up are increasing resources , <unk> , logging and so on .
But what 's important is that I want to have a cell phone .
And that <unk> has been <unk> a lot of people at the age of five , because it 's <unk> <unk> , and they called it " <unk> " and that 's what they 're doing with the mobile phone , which is that the area is going to be able to find a very important piece of war , <unk> in Congo .
After the first war , we lost all things , and what I did was I saved something , including my life , my lives and my colleagues .
And I was buried in some of our new cars , to protect them .
Some of those devices are in front of the <unk> , on the top of the <unk> .
He 's not in the <unk> plant , but it 's going to depend on our device .
And the rest of the body is , because they want to <unk> it , they do n't understand it ; they 're not going to do it . They 're <unk> them .
So that 's me , and I 'm going to do that in Uganda , trying to save 40 specimens with people with cars and <unk> .
And we succeeded .
I spent 10 specimens in the <unk> in <unk> .
And then , after the war , I can bring them back to the beginning , and we can do it .
And the second World War is not aware of the outcome .
We 're sitting with friends and friends in <unk> radio , and some beautiful music , when it hits .
So that 's really bad .
We 're listening to that , and in Eastern wars , it 's very quickly .
And I would like to go to the same place in the same place before .
<unk> resources are remix purpose .
Three different moves of movement and <unk> , in the same region , engage in this area .
There 's no way to work .
They hugged everything .
<unk> : Oh , unbelievable .
That 's a bunch of people who have power , we have to talk about them .
What is the rules of the <unk> ?
They ca n't do it .
So I went to it .
There were Yves seals .
So I started talking about telling them that we were in the area of protected .
This is the rules that <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are completely <unk> .
But they say , " You think you do n't think they 're all important , and you protect animals .
We do n't think so .
We have to do that because it makes our movement progress .
I said , " No , you ca n't do it . "
We 're talking to them , and I 'm at work .
And trying to protect our device , try and protect the people that we have .
We 're traveling .
But what I 'm doing is , I do n't work for them .
And sometimes we 're going to show them that they 're talking to <unk> -- and sometimes they say my languages , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I heard their strategy and their plans .
Sometimes they have <unk> , they 're <unk> their <unk> .
And they 're going to bring me out of what I 'm doing . Where do you go from ?
This is my only device -- my satellites mobile phone , my computer and a solar - powered <unk> .
Every time , every day , when we came to meetings , we made a short email , and I wrote a short email , sending it to a short list of telling you a little bit .
I do n't know how many people I 'm going to do .
I 'm sending the news of the war and the people who are going to think about it .
They 're starting to anticipate what we 're doing at the morning , and it 's been published on the BBC in the morning .
There 's something else going on .
One day we went to a meeting .
Excuse me .
We went to a lot of <unk> .
And he 's got hooked with me .
And he asked me , " You know how to use this stuff ? "
I said , " I never saw it . "
I do n't know .
And my cellphone is in my pocket .
So that 's an opportunity for me to trust me .
No , they did n't look at me .
So I was afraid .
When we end up , I put it back in the forest .
And I 'm bringing news to the news , and some other things that I do every day , with the United Nations , for my New York department , to my city .
And for those people , you have a huge amount of pressure .
Because there 's no other way of doing anything they 're doing at the same time .
In the two two <unk> , they kill all the animals .
We had 14 <unk> , and we had a pregnant man .
In war , continue to fight , after a week , in this area , we 've got only the first one .
This is the only ones that can beat me with these <unk> .
This is not local bears ; it 's not a priority .
They 're very happily that they 're going to be released in wars , because we 're releasing the news between wars and places in the war .
A week later , we celebrated the <unk> birthday of the elephant , and only 50 meters of <unk> was born in that <unk> <unk> .
I was almost mad .
And I was against them , and I went into the literature and met the <unk> <unk> .
I succeeded .
And that was only the elephant who had swallowed down the <unk> .
We 've got to do it after that kind of war , which we have to fix .
We have some money -- I 've got 150 dollars .
I 've taken half of the quarter of my trips to <unk> plants , because we do n't have good infrastructure for growth .
The wildlife protected the <unk> , doing more things .
I started working on the workforce where I was going to raise productivity .
And I had the opportunity to start collecting place in my country .
They give me some support for me .
Now it 's used to train young people .
And at the same time , this is the design of what we 're working on , and my design is to tracked global greenhouse effects , which is that the effects of carbon dioxide is accelerating .
This is one of the research studies of our 40 acre of <unk> , which we 're going to do with a centimeter and a butterfly plant , and we 'll always track them .
We have about 15 years of data now to see how it 's going to make a difference .
And then -- I think that 's hard for me .
This is a very awkward talk , I think .
I do n't know where to start , from where I end .
When I think about it , I do n't think I 'm going to talk about this .
But now I want to get it to a name called " <unk> . "
Are you listening ?
Now we 're talking about <unk> , <unk> Africa .
But what is the <unk> tool , or a game ?
And I think we 've seen the rules of war , like football , football .
All people are happy , but nobody does n't want to see what 's going on in Darfur .
Now we said , ooh , my God .
Look in Rwanda .
Because the force was speaking .
And I do n't think anyone will <unk> Google because it 's doing the right thing to do , or even <unk> <unk> people .
But it provides the best service for <unk> .
But what happened in the <unk> industry ?
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you , thank you .
And there you go .
This is an amazing story .
I suspect many of you have the same problems with me .
How do we help you ?
Yves <unk> says this is a very awkward problem .
Now I feel nervous .
And I think help us , people sometimes <unk> action .
I did it myself .
If I knew that when I was in the age of a year , I would n't do that <unk> diversity .
Many of you are already seeing the wisdom of Africans , but there are fewer people who can teach .
A lot of people died because all of these strains , malaria , poverty , poor people .
And you can use the support of our support .
How many people have the opportunity to go to America , read a graduate student .
And I went to the Netherlands , and I read Dr. <unk> .
But many of them are in this because they do n't have money .
They were even <unk> .
They do n't even have a <unk> .
The ability to build the world is going to make the next generation of the generation to be better next to the next generation .
Chris Anderson : Thank you , thank you .

Bill <unk> is an extraordinary remix , and he 's been exploring the worst of the Earth 's worst amount of effort for looking at the Moon and trying to develop a automatic robot on the <unk> star .

Bill <unk> on the world 's world 's world
And I 'm going to bring you to the first place where the natural air is , so many people believe that it will be proven the worst of the world .
I said that because this exploration is not ending .
There 's a couple of contexts of exploration that are developed next year , and I 'll try to introduce you to this .
Now , one of the ways to change the world is that the <unk> of Science in science , in the past 150 years , technology has been able to achieve some places that we 're completely ignorant of .
And we can go into the Earth 's gravitational field .
We found that we found the exotic air and the clouds , and those <unk> were spectacular , looking at the window .
When we go to this kind of <unk> , we 're all going to be four months old , and our team 's size , the size of the group , has <unk> people .
A lot of <unk> , what do you choose to do ?
The process is n't like NASA , but it 's <unk> .
And what we 're looking for is the ability to work , and we can do it for a long period of long - term , long - lasting , long - term <unk> people .
And if you want to know , this is our <unk> test .
But we 're also dealing with the ability to deal with people who are <unk> . These skills are capable of being used in <unk> .
The pressure is very important when it comes to the limit of human visibility .
From <unk> , it does n't look like a caves of a business traveling .
What you see here is two weeks , it 's not the Grand Canyon , but it is <unk> .
We came up with two <unk> of <unk> .
It 's like a high - speed <unk> journey , and different is the different <unk> of your rope .
This is a little bit of a <unk> in this underground environment , which is completely irrelevant , and it 's dark .
And I 'm supposed to talk about all the things that you 're looking at here , and it 's a lot of people who are going to use it .
Otherwise , every place is black .
The more you get to avoid the problem , the more it gets <unk> .
It 's basically a <unk> tree .
And ultimately , you 're going to get to a horrible place where these slides are n't very glamorous and not glamorous .
So I found a little video from the late ' 80s .
This is <unk> in Mexico .
Now I 'm going to remind you that the technology that you use here is not dangerous .
Now , unless we 're doing it , otherwise we do n't do that .
And also , I 'm also saying that we 're going to have a lot of Hollywood on the bottom of the last year , at least not seen the talent of people in the next year .
If you have underground chaos , it must be <unk> , when you go from the nearest three - year - old , you 're starting to <unk> the <unk> of the past .
I 'm going to collect a international team next year .
We 're going to come out of the underground ice rate about 20 feet above the ground -- starting to shoot . That place comes from 30 km .
<unk> will continue to move through the ground to 30 days .
I think there 's no progress in this exploration .
And finally , if you look down into this cave , the probability says you might go into a one .
There 's a lot of water .
And that 's what happens when people get to the map of the <unk> .
This word I remember fondly , because there are two reasons why there are two reasons .
First , it 's the name of my hand , second , number two , because the challenge of these places is a <unk> .
And since recently , we 've developed a lot of <unk> to explore places like places .
This is a kind of <unk> device that keeps life .
You can use it at least 200 meters of light in underwater scale .
You feel a little bit like a <unk> when you walk underwater .
It 's a little bit more <unk> , but it 's much larger than that .
And this allows you to think about how to design your instruments to be more safe .
This is some footage of the National <unk> Museum .
Narrator : Exploring is a physics process , and it allows you to have no place for human beings .
This is a completely recent ending on Earth .
There are only few people who can do it .
Bill <unk> : That film is <unk> in Florida .
This film has a very strong film : all of the devices that you 're seeing here are <unk> years earlier .
They were invented in two years , and they 're actually exploring the project .
This is what you see here here -- this is <unk> <unk> -- it <unk> the world 's first three - dimensional 3D Map , which is <unk> in the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> that goes through the other world .
This is <unk> .
Yves <unk> talks another day called <unk> <unk> .
Research of scientists believed that there was one of the most likely life in the world to explore the Earth 's face , and life is in <unk> planets .
For those of you who have never seen this story , Jim Cameron Cameron was called " <unk> <unk> . "
This is a little clip of a small clip -- the mission of exploration is going to be the ultimate challenge of the robot .
It 's going to be a little bit more than a six - hour folding license .
It had to be very clever to avoid all kinds of chronic injuries to be found .
Now we have to travel through ice .
It needs a <unk> <unk> .
It 's basically a <unk> <unk> .
ice is probably three to 25 miles deep .
A week later , a week , melts in the first few weeks of the weight of its own weight , <unk> through the ancient ice , until you get to <unk> , what do you do ?
You need a cow , a <unk> swimming .
It has to be smart , and it 's a very clever way to manage the Earth to make decisions .
Bill <unk> : Jim Axelrod does n't know about six months ago , NASA has introduced me to a team of <unk> , and to develop the archetype of the wing <unk> <unk> .
I spent three years researching , design and systems , designed <unk> -- <unk> <unk> explores <unk> .
It 's like a movie that describes it , it 's a sensitive little .
It has 70 tilt sensors , 10 <unk> of <unk> in the computer , carrying 10 million <unk> .
This is the beginning , the north of Mexico , the <unk> of the hole .
Somebody was participating in <unk> <unk> . Nobody knows what it is .
Exploring it is one of the missions in the <unk> .
We have two ways of working on research .
How do you do an experiment on the ground ?
How do you make robots like <unk> ?
There 's more steps , and I do n't have enough time , but we 're basically collecting robots through this space , we let it go through the space -- <unk> , that stuff .
We <unk> the surface of the <unk> , and it 's going to have a lot of life on it .
We 're going to move forward , and that 's what it 's called to figure out color looking at color .
And if we have interesting things , we put it underneath the microscope .
If it passes through the microscope , we collect samples .
We collect samples , or we 're directly collecting solid structures from the ceiling .
That process does n't need a remote control .
This is all made up of robots .
This machine is the largest innovation that we developed in the developing world , called 3D <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> eye .
And what it feels like is that it 's going to move forward , allowing it to make a new exploration of it , and it can make sense of the place where it comes in .
What I 'm going to show you next is the first time I 'm going to show you the first storm exploration .
This year , we 're ready to go from <unk> diving from a kilometer across the boat , if we were lucky enough to come back to the first <unk> of bacteria <unk> .
And then the second step was to test it in Antarctica , and then if investors <unk> , then NASA has helped , we might start doing the first evidence of life on the Earth .
So what about the <unk> space exploration ?
The U.S. government recently announced the project back to the moon .
And the success of this mission would have been a little bit of government - funded scientists and <unk> articles on the moon .
It does n't start to look at the evolution of the universe , from human exploration .
If we want to make progress in the lifetime , imagine that <unk> have to be changed .
What I 'm going to show you next is some of the controversies .
I hope you 're listening to me and believe that we 're talking about it .
private exploration is <unk> in space .
<unk> is the Earth 's Earth to space .
<unk> <unk> and Richard <unk> already started trying to <unk> them .
Come on , anyway , wait .
Another thing that we need to do is to evacuate the ground .
<unk> is starting to do space , and then we can do it .
The last one , really , is space - <unk> .
It does n't look like this .
If it exists , it changes all the projections and the space exploration exploration project .
Now , to give you a sense of <unk> , I 'm going to teach you a little bit of space - <unk> .
First of all , what you 're going to do is to pay every <unk> in space .
Can anyone meet this one week ?
You have to pay for a million dollars .
You have more money to get to the TED price , if Google is in Google .
Secondly , 90 percent of the weight flies .
So every time you 're going to do anything in space , each one of you is <unk> , you 're in <unk> .
Even if you do that , they ca n't fight the <unk> .
So what if you can get the fuel on 10 ?
There is a place to do that .
In fact , it can be more cheap -- you can get a quarter of a quarter of the price in the moon if you can get out on the moon .
In the late 13 years , it 's called <unk> , called <unk> .
This is the most famous discovery of this project , which is <unk> in the mid - south corner of the moon .
That signal is very powerful , only 10 miles across the surface of the boat to generate it , which is hundreds of millions of years of legacy and <unk> .
If we 're going to be able to make <unk> , we have to find a lot of resistance in the space of space .
We do n't do it now .
And the way that people do this now is to try to overcome the effects of all sorts of air dynamics .
We have to overcome it .
We can do this because of the space of space .
We almost use <unk> systems .
This is a group of <unk> leaders in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We can expand it almost almost every other area .
Bob Cooper 's now testing a device on space .
We do more .
We can build space <unk> , ships and water platforms .
Another thing .
When you come back from the Moon , the orbit tells us .
You need to go back about 10,000 feet per second when you 're going to go back .
You 've got two options .
You can burn your rockets , or you can do incredible things .
You can do it on the stratosphere , smash the speed , go back to space .
It 's never been done .
It 's a very risky thing to do than <unk> .
Traditional spaces are exploring everything that you need fuel enough to make sure that every sane person is safe .
If you try to do this , it takes billions of dollars to make a <unk> light on the moon .
But if you send a cow to go there , do n't have the fuel emissions -- anybody knows the story of <unk> ?
Not that story . I 'm more like <unk> .
I love <unk> , and I 'm really excited about it , so we 're not ready .
But if you really are really glamorous , you can get it out there and create it , and it becomes the most exciting demo that you leave the Earth and do n't have a value .
People say no two million dollars in space and 20 years .
That 's wrong .
Over seven years , we can win up a industrial plan for <unk> <unk> , showing that humans can use the moon to make business on the Moon .
We 're in one of the most exciting times of human history .
We 're in a funny <unk> , and this person is wealth and imagination that drives people into space .
What I 've described is that space explosion can create a whole new kind of industrial , and provides a key to explore space .
<unk> patterns require a new way .
We can start once <unk> the same thing as Lewis and Clark of the States in the United States , where industrial exploration is developed by the moon , showing that they can become the foundation of <unk> .
And when people talk about <unk> , they seem to be <unk> and <unk> .
And then I 'm going to make some medicine right now .
I love this space protector .
The right thing is that this can be done in seven years .
And the people who join me are going to be able to do this with the rest of the history of people to explore what 's going on here today , and if you 're here , <unk> <unk> .
They 've got an intimate path .
We do a whole whole thing to have .
About 100 years ago , <unk> <unk> said , " We need what we need to move forward . "
Now it 's also the same thing that I 'm going to take on the surface of the moon , and we 're going for all of us to open up the last task of <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .

Yves <unk> on <unk>
<unk> values : Maybe it 's possible .
This is a <unk> I did at 18 years old , and I took a baby .
What I 'm going to talk about today is creates , and art art .
I 'm not just going to show you 18 minutes of the conference , and trying to refine the TED , <unk> <unk> : I have to say , these <unk> really have a feeling of death .
Okay .
And I 'd like to say that if I lied , or <unk> <unk> , he says that he will vote <unk> and ask me to <unk> .
This is what scientists wrote in the audience .
And when I use that , I do n't have to say that you 're saying , " I am , with my head , my <unk> , and I 'm going to tell you what 's going on in the middle , if I 've lost anything .
And I 'm going to talk about the creation of my personal creation process , which contained a bunch of different events before I started doing it before .
That includes the baby , and I called something called " <unk> . "
In the midst of the fortune , we have to look at whether we 're born , or in our brains , whether there are some traits that are n't normal in the brain , and some of them are kind of creative .
And some other ways to say that is that we 're born .
Some people , like my mother , would say I 've found these stories from <unk> .
Some people say that crisis is a side effect -- like <unk> <unk> -- which is you have a little <unk> , or depressed .
But I have to tell these people -- I 've read it recently , and I 'm going to read something that does n't necessarily necessarily have an electromagnetic transmitter , but I think it will affect the brain that you have part of your brain .
I have to mention that , in fact , I 've had this temporal pulse of the temporal lobe , and I 'm telling you a little bit about my book .
And one of the things that comes from the identity of identity is , who , why am I here ?
Sometimes , you have these skills , but they 're not going to have the skills of creativity .
I was still painting . I thought I would be a painter .
This is my pop - up <unk> dog .
It does n't seem to appear , but it 's not really a good idea .
Because I can do it , but I 'm going to paint it .
And I 'm probably going to jump from a book from one book .
But I did n't feel very glamorous about what I 'd like to do , and you know , you 're looking at the grades , but it 's not going to make me pretend that I can use a whole bunch of books .
One of the principles of creativity is to have a childhood disorder .
I think there 's a lot of psychic and normal people that I have come from the parents , and the people who are very interested in love .
<unk> was a toy I had at nine years old , and I was able to get a doctor in <unk> .
There are also a few more psychological gains : <unk> <unk> becomes a pianist to become my second career , but ultimately it becomes an extension of my feeling .
But in fact , there are really some real psychological injuries in my life when I 'm in my life .
And I found my brother , in 1967 , and my dad died six months later .
My mother believed that there was something wrong about her , and she wanted to figure it out .
My dad is a <unk> , and he believes that <unk> is going to solve the problem .
But they were all dead , and they moved around six months .
And after that , my mom believed that it was a fate , and she went around the universe and all of the reasons why she was doing this thing .
Everything else . She does n't believe accidentally .
All the things .
She believes there was one reason she was born in her mother , she believed she died her mother .
So I was dead , because my mom believed that I would be the next , or she was next to her next .
When you 're dealing with death , you start thinking about everything .
And you start very creative , from a way to keep it .
And that makes me think about a big problem .
Some of you are still thinking about it .
Why does it happen , how do they happen ?
<unk> : How do I make these things happen ?
This is a very important problem in writing .
Because you have to have 300 pages of paper on this question : Why do n't it happen , and it 's how it happens .
So , what do I do with this story ?
I think that 's the question of all scientists .
I 've developed my own <unk> in my world as a maker .
There 's a lot of <unk> to try and create a little bit , trying to make a little bit of a year .
And when I think about the crisis , I also think that this is something that comes from a life of life .
And I was doing observation in a lot of events that almost everything happened in this conference .
So I 'm here to do this with mechanical <unk> : although I do n't understand quantum mechanics , but I 'll do it for a process .
In quantum mechanics , there are dark energy and dark matter .
It 's like we 're trying to explain what happens .
There 's a lot of bad news , you do n't know what it is , but only knowing it .
But when you try to figure out how to connect the relationship , you have the core of the story , and you suddenly find things .
This is what I want to do in my work .
There 's no sensation in quantum mechanics , at least I think .
Same thing is happening in writing .
Another <unk> effect , when you 're looking for some things , what happens is that you try to see it in different directions , trying to figure out what it 's like to try and find it , or whatever it is , and if you get to <unk> , the story is <unk> .
Nothing happened .
And you should be able to find it , and you 're really sure that it 's not going to happen .
I do n't want to ignore what happens in the other side of the universe like some scientists .
So I 'm also going to talk about the way that the string theory theory is not just a multi - level of creativity , but also <unk> levels of anxiety .
And they 're all together .
Or you have another problem .
As you say , the universe is <unk> .
You do n't understand what 's going on , but some things are doing .
<unk> is a very , very comfortable feeling , but for my life , it still exists .
It always happened . For example , a thing happened .
At the time I did the editing , I read a woman in the Iraq War , and she made a very famous Chinese .
" <unk> a <unk> , you have to negotiate for his life . "
It means that since we go into Iraq , we should be able to do it until something else . You know , even a thousand years .
Another example is " <unk> <unk> . "
The Buddhist Buddha of a Buddhist Buddhist believes that people should n't reject .
But it 's still a huge amount of money , but it still does n't work .
And for <unk> , they claim that they 're in the <unk> fish fish , but the fish <unk> on the process .
In this two story of the two stories , there is one of those statements that comes from my mom 's Chinese China , and you have to negotiate for his life . "
That 's a <unk> : forget about other people 's <unk> .
But I think there 's somebody who 's really excited if somebody 's really excited .
But these two things , no matter what the <unk> fish , or a <unk> , is <unk> with your intention .
We have a response to what happens in our lives .
<unk> <unk> .
And there are some of the things that we need to do .
And it does n't have to happen .
Now , what do we do ? What is our responsibility ?
How do we do that ?
And we 're going to keep the responsibility and try to figure out what 's going on in our behavior , and it 's good , so I 'm not supposed to spend a lot of money .
This is a hard time for me to accept my life , even though I wrote books , so that 's called a <unk> coat .
And once you realize that this problem is , it 's ubiquitous .
Where can you see it ?
And I also know they 're all there .
In writing , I see these statements , these clue , and I realized they 're always doing it , but it 's too bad .
What I need to do is focus .
When I have a question , it 's a focal focus .
These are the things that are going to happen in the world , and what happens is that there 's a relationship between these events .
It 's ubiquitous .
That 's what you think it is , or maybe it 's going to happen .
It can explain it , and it 's a focus .
You can find it .
When you start using it .
You start looking at what makes you feel nervous .
When your brothers meet the problem , do you help him ?
Why do n't you ?
It might be more serious than you think about human rights problems .
And I wondered whether I should n't go , because somebody told me that I was there for the local police force .
But a few days later , I ask myself , " Why are we going to care about others or visions ? "
This is the feeling that I feel like I 'm growing up as a dad in my father 's dad , and the <unk> of all the rules and the morality .
And finally I decided to meet myself , I do n't know , to write a book , and how it 's going to happen , but I can only wait for the timing of time .
We always care about what the world is .
We said , what can we do ?
Not everybody can go to Africa , or in the hospital working , and how do I do this ?
I think one of the most important questions today is <unk> .
We go back again .
And when I meet the <unk> of morality , how do I feel so comfortable about how I 'm going to go back to the relationship that I 've ever met , why am I here ?
That seems obvious , but it does n't .
We do n't like the laws of morality , but it 's not necessarily necessary .
In my writing , that 's where I started .
Sometimes it looks like I 'm in the universe .
My mother said , from the first beginning , inspired from my grandmother , because I do n't know what I 'm going to know .
I did n't write my grandmother because the <unk> of the spinal cord was rejected in the story , and the woman wrote that woman killed that fact that I had no idea .
My mother thinks that this information has come from my grandmother .
And there 's a couple of contexts , and some of the romantic events , I 've got a different writing .
And I was writing a big story about the history of the old era and <unk> .
So the details of the story .
And I came up with this book from <unk> , and the first time I was a story of my story and where I had the characters that I needed to do in a place where a <unk> and a person thought he was God 's son .
Do you feel that it 's all accident ?
But what about <unk> ? What is the opportunity ?
What 's the inspiration for those people ?
This is a part of the story .
And these are what I think every day .
It 's particularly true when it 's going to happen in good things .
But I 'm convinced that this <unk> is what I want to know about what they 're doing , and I appreciate it .
Because , I think , more and more , the more they do .
And there 's a place where I 'm just working with my friends , and that 's where it 's going to be in the middle of the <unk> , where there 's a <unk> , the city of the <unk> , the city of the United States , where it 's a big , barren village , right ?
And we came up with three <unk> in the third Sea , and I 'm not comfortable with it , I know that this will become my story .
One of the stories is in the third valley .
One of the pictures I wrote is , a man , <unk> <unk> .
I do n't know why I wrote it , but it 's a nurse .
And I went into the morality , and a friend asked me that I would n't go to the Grand Canyon , so I 've met a man on the beach .
It 's a Chinese man who throws the damn . There is no <unk> , no tool .
And I asked him , how could this be ?
And he said , everything is in the world .
That 's what my story is about .
Something happened in my writing when I did it .
Is it because I have a special <unk> because these strong accidents are what I want to write ?
Or is this something that we ca n't explain at the same time ?
I also think about accidents .
As I said , my mother never believed accidents .
And what about the accident ?
How do we do that in the opposite of the laws of these laws ?
I had a feeling of experience that I was most in China , and I had the poorest <unk> in China .
I saw this beautiful place I 'd like to go back .
When the National <unk> asks me , I do n't want to write a few articles about China . I know my opportunity .
So I said , I 'd like to write that song .
They said , well , I 've been visited in the middle of my day , a terrible accident , and a man is standing in a <unk> .
60 households per 60 family family , 40 families .
This family is demanding responsibility .
His son had been rejected by three kilometers of <unk> .
And the Westerners would say , but it 's an unexpected , that 's not fair .
It 's not <unk> .
But when I was writing about this story , I had to give the idea .
There 's a couple of times , but I have to get out of the way , and I have to go there .
So I went to three times in different seasons .
And in this poor village , I was starting to feel very different about what happened to the history of history when you feel happy , and your ritual , your tradition , our traditions and other family methods -- and I started to understand that this kind of responsibility involves its own justice .
I also started to understand that they use their use of their work . One of the rituals that came up with a <unk> is to bring someone out of the <unk> .
You , as a community , like a Westerners , would say , that 's it , but for a while , you 've got to think about the magic thing , and you start thinking about what these wondrous things are going to do .
So I decided to do it with them , and the more that I wrote , more and more , I believe that these religions are important -- to really close these beliefs , because it 's the answer to the truth to tackle my life .
Over time , I wrote a lot of work , but it 's not a moment , and I 'm going to tell you what it is .
And it came out of the way , and it was no longer me .
And in each case , they have different interpretations .
But I still go back to the same question , how do I <unk> ?
How do I create my life ?
I asked the question , and I told me , it did n't have an answer .
I do believe that the detail of the story , the details of stories , and what 's happening in the history of a story .
I also believe that these are the ones that we 've heard about , about luck , fate and accidents , and the interaction of these mysterious forces , I 'm going to show you some concepts .
What 's the reason I think of myself in the universe , or whether you 're going to become something like this , whether it 's completely constructed ?
I can imagine the answer to the answers , or imagine it 's going to be the real world .
This is the way I found a truth , not absolutely , or completely true .
They have a lot of possibilities . They have no idea .
From never a whole answer .
Even if you have , it 's a good thing to remind myself , because I always find new things .
And if there 's a answer to the answer , this is the whole answer , which is simplicity .
Imagine that it 's going to be embedded in the story until I and my story , and my story .
And that 's that I found that if I could feel the answer to the story , then I went close to understanding what was going on .
Because when we ask everything , it 's how to feel it .
I have to be part of a story .
When we come to the end of the talk , I 'm going to reveal what 's going on here , and it 's inspired by changing our lives .
Here it is .
Thanks very much .
<unk>
In a lot of time , in a very difficult period of <unk> , we tend to ignore things unseen . Private expert <unk> -- the <unk> of our attention , which is even more <unk> .
business , choice , culture , dance , shopping , storytelling

<unk> <unk> and his blood pressure
I 'm going to give you four specific examples of my view -- and then I 'll finish it -- a company called <unk> , which is how to increase their <unk> for three quick three times , and artists are <unk> by one thing that makes a difference .
One of the most <unk> people , in the last few years , is one of my greatest mistakes that created a record company called " <unk> <unk> . "
I had to tell you about a guy called <unk> Williams and the story of <unk> <unk> and his blood pressure .
So , before <unk> <unk> was invented , I wanted to know what people said ?
Like the great innovation , or anything else .
And this is a guy named Bob <unk> , and he 's invented the blood bread , which is what most of these <unk> are doing on the sales and the <unk> .
In fact , the invention of the wing bread was this case -- the first 15 years of <unk> could have bought it , nobody knew . It was a <unk> invention .
And the reason for that is that the idea of <unk> bread comes out before the sun bread , and it does n't have anybody to think about it before .
It 's the success of the wing , as we 're talking about all the other successful things that we 've talked about , and it 's not the recipe for how to do it , or what it is , it 's the question of how you can spread your ideas .
I think you want you to change the change , and you think it 's going to happen , the key thing is that you have to come up with a way to get spreading .
For me , no matter whether you 're running a golf ball or a <unk> , or you are a professional , even if you 've been driving a piece of ice .
And that applies to anything that you do whatever you 're doing .
We 're living in an idea of living .
<unk> people are winning ideas .
Basically , I 'm going to take a lot of <unk> as an example , because I can put the best <unk> in my face , and it 's easy to measure .
But when I use these examples , I hope you will forgive me because everything needs you to spend time to detect .
The core of the idea is to spread the television and the TV .
A lot of TV and <unk> makes us feel more easy .
I call the television center .
And it 's the process that you 've got , first of all , to buy some ads -- and you get your clients .
And then you get more goods to them .
And finally , you continue to do more ads .
That 's how it swells up , and the same way is that our military industry has been used for a long time .
And that pattern , we 've heard about it yesterday , if we 're able to have a song where we can get out there and tell them what they 're going to do about what we want .
And if we do that , everyone will have noticed that we can achieve <unk> .
Yes , the TV industry was inspired by the <unk> of my childhood , as you could .
I mean , all of these successful products because some people know how to use a kind of an unexpected approach to people , using a way to do something that does n't need a ads .
And then one thing happened , and all of you have laid down television .
It 's just the last couple of years of people who have been discovered in the last couple of years .
This photo is very <unk> , I 'm sorry , that 's my heart .
And the thing in the blue blue box is what I want to say .
All right . I went to this leopard , <unk> , and I needed to buy some medicine .
The <unk> managers took a billion dollars on the blue box trying to figure out what I noticed in a year .
With a billion dollars of ads and magazine , <unk> and <unk> , these seals , the <unk> -- all that all I can ignore , all of the information that I normally forget .
So I would n't forget them because I did n't have any questions .
I bought the medicine on the yellow box because I always used it .
I 'm not going to take any minute from my time , because I do n't care .
There 's a magazine called " <unk> <unk> " -- it 's about 180 pages to talk about water .
Yeah . Those are the reports of water , water .
So let 's imagine about 40 years ago , there was only " About " <unk> , " and ' <unk> and " the <unk> . "
This is the magazine of water .
This is a new product from <unk> Foundation -- <unk> water .
All right . Each three weeks , they 'd come up with a new product , because they did n't know anything about the product .
The next piece of this is two days ago , and I 've got the key part of it and you can see it here .
And they came up , and they 're going to spend a hundred billion dollars to try to manage a leopard glove to guide a <unk> gloves with <unk> <unk> , hoping that it will go into the <unk> sandwich .
And I 'm thinking about what they 're doing in a animation commercial , a <unk> <unk> -- the sound of <unk> , allowing you to vote , through the city , to buy a liberal sandwich .
Now , this is <unk> , and he 's right , he always is talking to someone who needs to listen to you .
And the world was traveling every day , and I , me , I am , my favorite person -- one of my favorites -- this is me .
I do n't want anyone to say , I just want to get a email . "
So the consumer , I 'm not able to buy stuff in <unk> , and I mean what the authority might need to be bought , or the <unk> of the New Yorker may probably print your article .
The consumer does n't care about you .
Part of the reason is -- they have more chosen opportunities than ever before .
In a world where we have a lot of choices , we do n't have to do something about something that we 're going to do .
So for example , when you 're driving on the road , if you see a leopard , then you continue to drive because you 've seen <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> . It 's boring .
Who 's going to stop the car on the side , and say , look , a <unk> . Nobody does .
But if that 's a purple point -- that <unk> <unk> ?
As long as you get me around .
If it 's a purple man , you might be aware of it .
I mean , if all the <unk> are purple , you feel boring .
One thing is that it can make people talk about what they 're talking about , what change ? What is the key thing -- is this a special thing ?
It 's a very cool thing to say , because we often understand it , it means -- it 's worth us to discuss .
That 's essentially the nature of the idea .
Among all the cars in the United States , one of the two dollars per gallon is a $ 400 dollar car , and enough enough to put it into a <unk> .
People are willing to buy them , and they 're only the only one in common .
And in the first week of the <unk> , I have a change in the <unk> .
It does n't diminish the " <unk> , " and they 're usually a <unk> <unk> .
But it turned out that it 's just because it is published Monday week .
Because it 's <unk> , because it is fresh .
Because you 've seen it all the time -- I do n't know it -- and then you go to it .
One of the most successful stories in the last 20 years -- one thing that 's going to be done in blue boxes is the same thing , and the other one is a little bit cheaper .
And the only thing about them is they 're very different .
Recently , it 's going to be done at the beginning of the day , whether we do what we do , and we have a lot of life .
And one thing is , people know what this industry will be like , because they used to be used .
We have to figure out what to think about .
And how to understand this is not about using <unk> articles to <unk> people , or whether it 's to get people to see it .
This is a completely different approach to thinking about what 's going to get spread .
This pair of chairs -- they bought 10 billion <unk> -- because they <unk> the meaning of labor chairs .
The Berlin Wall is no longer a marketing campaign ; you 're working on the workplace .
This guy , his name is <unk> <unk> -- the most famous baker in the world -- in two and a half months ago , he just died , and he 's a hero of mine and friends .
He was born in Paris , and he sold a million dollars per year .
At the top of his own <unk> , an X - ray of a baker is <unk> a bread in a <unk> oven .
When the first thing happened in <unk> , the French <unk> was very upset .
They do n't want to get this bread . It does n't look like a " French bread . "
This is not the bread in the French imagination .
But it 's because of the <unk> and <unk> , and slowly slowly , slowly it becomes <unk> until the last time , it became the <unk> of Paris .
Now <unk> is living in London , and his bread is <unk> around the world .
We used to make a lot of physical goods for us all the time .
This is the public marketing .
It does n't matter whether it 's a very big market for the mainstream .
But they 're especially passionate about the people who are special for <unk> .
All those products went to the middle .
But one of the world 's world - industrial center is moving away from us , and I think it 's not going to happen .
I do n't think that you need to sell things for all of you .
You should sell things to real care and care .
Those who are interested in something .
When you speak they 're listening because they like to hear -- to communicate .
If you 're lucky enough , they 're going to stay with their friends in the circle , and then it will spread .
And finally spread to the whole curve .
They have something that I call <unk> -- this is a great Japanese word .
It 's about the people who describe <unk> , so they 're going to get rid of the <unk> of Tokyo to <unk> a new shack , because that 's what they are doing .
For building a product , a marketing idea , for anyone who wants to solve the problem , any place where you do n't have a crowd , it 's almost impossible .
Instead , you have to figure out a bunch of people , and those who really want to listen to you .
And they talk to them , and they 're very easy to get your ideas and the friends .
There 's a guy who loves <unk> workers , but not like a tourist ticket .
This is why many of you have a lot of <unk> , and there are no kinds of <unk> .
It 's not because it 's hard to create fun -- you can make fun of <unk> -- but nobody 's addicted to <unk> , so nobody can tell him .
<unk> <unk> is a company that has been introduced to understanding this .
They have a strategy , and what they 're doing is , in a city , with the people who are growing up in cities , it 's going to be <unk> in the city .
That 's 100 dollars per year , but it 's only 12 minutes .
Not everybody will like , but they do n't care about it .
And they want to tell people that it 's going to be <unk> .
These guys made the largest <unk> <unk> of the world .
It 's a voice of <unk> 747 , so you have a car - <unk> car that might <unk> the liver .
But the truth still tells us that when somebody wants to put a pair of cars into their own car , if they 're hungry or they hear people love , they can continue to do it .
It 's really easy -- to sell things to listen to you , maybe , perhaps , that people say to them .
So when Steve Jobs was talking to his speech , it was , well , those people who were <unk> from the state of the country , and all the people in the world were touched by his two hours of business -- this is the only thing that could make his company work -- and it 's a only one - up audience .
<unk> <unk> , the nearest two years covering <unk> .
And everybody made money . How do you do it ?
They 're only staying in their own website .
And those people who buy money in the Internet are <unk> and <unk> , and they 're doing their friends , and they 're going to stay in the way that it 's all about .
This hospital is sold for $ 10,000 dollars higher than normal <unk> .
But more than others are getting faster than the other hospitals .
This is the kiss of the <unk> company , of course , not to attract each person , but as long as it loves it , they 're going to talk about it crazy .
The <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> the Netherlands , <unk> <unk> , the end of their wealth , and it 's much more glamorous than the average , because they 've made a lot of ice because it 's very different .
Not just that they 've lost a new ad on the product , but they <unk> the traditional paint .

It 's a really cool way to make it , but some of the time .
This is a powered electron maker , you can put it on the wall .
And my dad had a kind of thing that was going on in his mailbox , and he was looking at the demise of himself .
And the people who come to his office want to know about how this <unk> comes from his table .
Every time you have this guy , the ideas get spreading .
This is not diamond , not real diamond .
They 're making <unk> .
You can also make your own <unk> after you 're dumped .
ooh , do you like <unk> ? It 's my grandmother .
So the <unk> industry becomes very <unk> .
But you do n't need to become <unk> -- you 're not going to do this as glamorous as him .
What you need to do is figure out what people want and give them .
That 's the kind of rules that can soon be answered quickly .
The first is that when you get a little bit larger , it 's free .
People who are very interested in are <unk> people who understand the good design .
Secondly : <unk> are the most risky things .
It 's really clear , right ?
As a model of model , it always provides ordinary goods to you .
That 's risky . And the idea is safe , different .
It 's probably one of the most <unk> things that you 're doing .
It 's very boring . It 's pretty boring . That 's great .
Whether you 're recording a <unk> , or you are a architect , you 've got a lot of life in the <unk> .
If one thing is great , it does n't make any difference because nobody 's going to notice it .
So I have three stories .
The first is <unk> companies , and they 're going to do it with a company .
That 's three times . Why ?
milk . milk , milk ; milk milk -- milk steak , milk milk -- not milk .
And the people who look at the <unk> are very different from the kinds of products that you 're looking at .
And three times they do n't do any ads , they 're just going to get the product into the place .
This is a different art . You do n't want to enjoy it , but the dog 's dog is really very different from New York .
<unk> -- not only changed a museum , and he changed the entire city of the world to <unk> the building .
Now , a lot of the people in the conference , you know , <unk> in <unk> , who knows where it is , and everybody says , we need a architect -- a <unk> can go ?
Because he did something .
Am I making a mistake ? I take a whole range of <unk> , hope they 're all <unk> -- that 's a new kind of stored -- and I sold it for two million dollars .
And he does n't like this new music .
So you have to figure out who really cares you .
Some of you employed their hands , and they say , " I want to know what you 're going to do . "
This is the last example I want to give you .
This is a map of a lake lake , in Washington .
As you can see , it 's in a <unk> <unk> .
But they did have a lake .
You all come from miles out of the past , right ?
But now no . So our <unk> said , " We 're money .
But what do we do ? As most of the commercials , they might have a little bit better and safe .
And then I went to a artist -- this is an artist 's work -- he 's interested in a tall <unk> lamp .
This is a hyperbolic <unk> , and they 're all about something that is worth looking at .
I do n't know what you 're doing , but that 's where I 'm going to go .
Thank you all of you .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> took the <unk> of his life -- like he said , the fear of fear and magic . Through sharing stunning , he shows how powerful photos can help change us .
fish , mission blue , oceans , photography , science
<unk>
Yves bears reveal the ocean -- with fear .
I want to share with you some of the stories that I 'm going to show you , as a photographer in my country .
I think I became a swimming photographer and <unk> because I had love to love the ocean .
And I want to tell you all the amazing things about all of me underwater , incredible wildlife and fun behavior .
And then , after 30 years of exploring the ocean , I never stopped with the astonishing astonishing surprise that I 've ever met in the sea .
But these days , I 've got increasingly <unk> to see the terrible things that I think are n't aware of .
And I did n't have my camera to go to these problems and tell a more wider story .
I want people to look at what 's going on here , whether it 's glamorous or glamorous .
The first reported is that when I worked on National <unk> , I realized that the ability to work in the cover of Natural History is about <unk> <unk> .
Now , what I 'd like to say , first of first , is just a little bit of attention , a few weeks in the next year , to <unk> and <unk> , from Canada , from Canada to Canada .
And this is all about eight percent of the ice that comes from the ice and the currents .
And because I 'm a swimming photographer , I want to tell you about underwater and corn , and to photograph the photos , like this , showing one of these little <unk> in the water , in freezing , to the first flying water .
But as I became involved in this story , I realized that there were two things that I could n't ignore .
The first is that these animals are swallowed by eight to 15 launches when they 're going to get killed .
This is actually the most large - scale <unk> of the planet on this planet , and hundreds of thousands of <unk> have been killed every year .
But what happened is that I think the biggest problem for Greenland seals is , because of global warming .
I showed you this scan of ice seals in Greenland seals .
And yet we saw a lot of ice in the picture , and there was a huge amount of water .
And these ice is very thin .
The problem is , to get their mother 's care , these little seals that require a stable ice flow expansion .
From that they 're born , they just need 12 days .
But if you do n't have that 12 days , they 're going to die .
And this photo shows a little bit about a five - year - old leopard -- there 's a couple of little leopard seals on it -- it 's because of <unk> <unk> , her mother is mad , and she 's going to go back and breathe back into the area .
Since I 've been there , this problem is accelerating every year .
I found that last year , there was a little bit of death in the Gulf in <unk> .
So obviously , there 's a lot of problems in this species .
This ended up being a magazine of National <unk> .
And it gets more focused .
And there 's this potential to look at the potential of the sea to start understanding the oceans .
So I wrote a story about the global crisis of fish , partly because in the last 30 years , I 've seen this problem on the ocean , because I read a articles in this article , and it shows 90 percent of the big fish that has gone through the past 50 or 60 years .
As tuna , <unk> and shark .
And when I read these , I was struck by these figures .
I think it should be a good thing to be in the media , but it does n't , so I want to do it completely different .
I hope that it 's much more like a war photography , which is the <unk> camera that I 've pulled to the world in the global world .
And the first part of the story , I think , is to make the joy of a lot of people who have a happy animal for them .
Well , I think when people go into a restaurant , a steak , we all know where steak comes from , and we also know what the old animal is , but when you eat a <unk> tuna , they know how much they 're eating .
Now , they 're the oceans and tigers .
In fact , these animals do n't have <unk> biology . They 're only the only ones in the world .
They 're almost impossible to go from the equator to <unk> animals , and they can <unk> in a year a year .
If we 're not efficient enough to capture them , they 're going to be growing up , and we might see a possibility to get rid of the <unk> tuna tuna .
But the truth is , we 're getting very efficient in the world , and they 're on the population .
This is a daily <unk> in <unk> , a few years ago .
And each day , these tuna tuna , like this <unk> , covered in a <unk> and a leopard .
And in my neighborhood everywhere , I suddenly thought , the oceans are n't a grocery store ; you know .
We ca n't be able to get more than a serious consequence .
In this book , I also want to show you how to get fish to fish and have some way of swimming and some ways that the <unk> , the world 's most universal spreads .
This is a <unk> in Mexico , but it 's the same way of working on the world .
And in the middle of two two <unk> , you put it in the middle .
And when this device gets caught in water , the door is covered by seawater , and it <unk> the web and then they put it in the middle and put a block on the bottom .
And then on the bottom of the <unk> <unk> shrimp shrimp .
But as you can think of it , it will capture everything else .
And it would destroy the <unk> <unk> , like sponges and coral reefs , and this is the most important habitat of other animals .
This photo took me on the <unk> of <unk> , and I took a copy of the shrimp for a hour .
So , he 's got a few shrimp , and maybe <unk> shrimp or <unk> all the other animals .
These are animals who die in the process of being caught , but they do n't have commercial commercial .
This is a real cost for eating shrimp , maybe 10 pounds of animal shrimp that have died in the process .
And in order to make this a little bit more appropriate , it took the bottom of the shrimp and shot this photo , and a leopard <unk> grabbed a lot of deaths like garbage seals , <unk> this huge amount of death , like <unk> , the animal , in the sea , but now it was being used as an hour before <unk> .
I want to focus on sharks because , in the Earth , we kill over 100 million dollars per year .
But before I go out of this room , I have a picture of how to die with sharks , and I think there 's still a lot of people who think that there are only dead sharks that are good at death .
But in a morning I came up with the water , and it was just dead sharks , it was just dead .
It 's a huge amount of <unk> and the eyes , and it 's kind of like <unk> , like this , if you want to say that .
And this photo ended up in the National <unk> Journal of <unk> coverage .
And I hope it can help readers notice that this is all about the problem .
And because I love sharks -- I 'm a bit of a <unk> -- and I want to do another , more happy about sharks , and talk about saving sharks .
So I went to the Republican <unk> , because it 's a very high place in the world , which is a good place for sharks , and it seems to be a lot of health that seems very healthy at the beginning of a few years .
I want to show you some species that we do n't show in magazine . They live in many places .
One of the places that 's called the <unk> beaches , the north coast , is there , and there 's been <unk> around the <unk> .
This image I photographed from a low - angle view of <unk> around us around the <unk> , and they 're just going around on the bottom .
But I did n't want to keep it a little bit like an impostor .
I do n't want them to be scary or scary .
It 's going to be a beautiful 15 foot , maybe 14 feet tall , and I expect that I have a little bit of a way to get out of the water , so she 's in her mouth , some <unk> , if <unk> <unk> on her face .
And I think this photo is more elegant , less threats , more respected than this species .
And I did n't have a story about this , which was about seven or 10 years ago , and it had n't been shot until about 70 or 30 years before .
It 's a creature who 's completely silenced .
But this animal is not seen as a species in Florida or in the Bahamas , and it 's the species of <unk> data .
Well , we know almost nothing about them .
We do n't know where they 're going to come from where the strike comes to , and where you 're singing , where mating they eat , in the middle of the Atlantic , but it 's about 80 percent .
You know , we 're going to get out of the way that we can lose them fast .
This is <unk> sharks , a single species of species in the most dangerous species , if you look at this list .
But this animal , in most of the animals , is about 90 percent of their activities in the area .
Because it 's a <unk> animal , and it lives in <unk> , because we do n't have a job at the negotiating table , I 've got an <unk> and my friends , a shark biologist <unk> once .
And of course , you 're going to see the <unk> and it 's clearly <unk> , obviously , I think .
In this case , I 'd like to focus on the ice of <unk> ice .
And I went to the popular <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
This is a picture of a <unk> <unk> , showing that these animals live in the head of life for a few years .
This is even a little bit more like a shark .
This is not a very rich picture of that .
But you know , we 're seeing a hundred or 11 feet long in the water , about about a foot deep on water .
But this is the most important habitat , and they 're going to live in the head of life , until they have enough to get to the rest of the world .
And after I left the <unk> , I really realized that these habitats are <unk> a new <unk> and <unk> .
If you 're willing to , we 're going to look at some of the recent reports of a single , <unk> species , where they 're facing the risks , the risk of other geniuses .
This is one of my comments on <unk> .
This is all the biggest , distributed , <unk> , major , the most long - term <unk> .
And what we saw here is , in <unk> , a leopard is pulling out the ocean .
This animal can trace back to about 12,000 years .
In their lives , it 's been out of their life , looking at the water , and look at the river , looking at the end of the day .
And today , they 've seen the apartments .
But even though it 's an amazing long life , they 're considered a terrible breed .
And in the Pacific , I shot this photo , and the number of times they fall down in about 15 years .
And what this photo shows is that one of the first <unk> <unk> is to try to <unk> water , and start a long - term journey .
It 's only about <unk> <unk> , and it 's going to go in early stages .
But it depends on their predators like , in the beaches of the beach , they 're waiting for <unk> , or waiting for <unk> fish .
Nature learns about these things , and the people who are trying to get rid of this do n't want to get it .
But what they did n't do is have a human pressure , human behavior , like one of the <unk> <unk> of this photo was taken in the evening of a night .
And in fact , I took this picture on the ice , and I put this sea ice pressure from the Arctic , so it would be free to dive into it .
But , you know , hundreds of thousands of <unk> <unk> are n't so lucky , and the future of this species is so dangerous .
In the other literature , another great breed of big species are <unk> <unk> .
And basically , it 's about a million years of paper , and a billion years ago , there 's a <unk> <unk> on this planet , but when the continent moves , the ocean is filled with the oceans , so there are two different kinds of species .
What we saw here is <unk> <unk> , and here we 're looking at the coast of the <unk> River , leaving the temple in Florida .
Now , these two whale <unk> have been released by the brink of extinction , but the number of times the amount of <unk> has got bigger <unk> , because they 're in the area of human activity .
This is the most endangered list of <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , because they 're the cities of the city , and they live in North America , the United States and Canada , they have to confront some cities .
This photo shows a little whale on the swimming coast of the <unk> coast <unk> on the Earth .
You can see the <unk> of the background .
They have to confront the substance of the ocean , like an <unk> and the drug , and those possibilities will impact their capacity .
They 'll be <unk> .
This photo shows a nine - year - old shot .
These white paintings are not natural .
These are <unk> of <unk> .
There are 70 percent of the population , but most of them do n't get rid of those <unk> , like laughter and <unk> .
They experimented with them , and they end up killing them .
Another problem is they 're <unk> .
This is just a animal of <unk> animals , in Canada , where they did a <unk> , and they made an <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> it .
So , all of these sorts of animal dynamics are made up of this animal , which makes them very low .
And for the rest of the species in <unk> , I found a number of numbers of data with the population of <unk> whales , and these are the numbers that are only about 10 years before the <unk> <unk> in New Zealand , in the South Side of New York .
I went there in a winter winter .
And at the time where animals were born , I could be the first human man witness .
I do n't wake up with the water and they feel amazing about them .
This photo , my <unk> , stand up in about 70 feet deep and a stunning beautiful beauty , 45 feet long , 70 -- 70 , you know .
They 're in perfect conditions , very big and health , which is very strong , not <unk> , and that 's what they do .
You know , when the leopard <unk> came in in <unk> , he wrote , you can go through the <unk> back to the Grand Canyon .
And now we ca n't go back to the point where we 're going to see the amount of force we have now .
I want to end with a hope of hope , one of the statements that I 've done about the ocean of marine conservation , to say that a solution to the world is a solution for fishing and global fish .
I 've been working in New Zealand and there 's been a very big job in Washington , because it 's really good to protect their ocean .
And I really want this slide to three things , and I hope it relates to rich , diversity and <unk> .
And one of the first places that I had was a <unk> in New Zealand called the <unk> of <unk> Mountain .
And the scientists told me , when the first sea developed in 1975 , they wanted to expect something something .
For example , they want to have a certain type of fish like New Zealand , where they come back , because they 've already elected the edges of the city .
And they did come back . There was something else that did n't predict .
For example , these fish ate <unk> , and when you get rid of the fish , anyone can only see <unk> <unk> .
But when these fish come back , they start eating <unk> , starting to control the number of <unk> in the bush , and slowly it arises .
That 's because the <unk> <unk> from large metals .
So , when the number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , the ocean broke her natural balance .
Well , this may be the sea of a thousand or 200 <unk> , but nobody could n't tell us whether it was .
And I worked in other places in New Zealand , in some beautiful , fragile organizations , like <unk> , and found that <unk> <unk> .
The blue line is <unk> .
On the north coast of New Zealand , I lifted the blue ocean , and some of the frozen sea covers to animals , like this big <unk> in the ice Sea .
Every single part of the ecosystems in this place looks very healthy , and the age of a <unk> ice cap is a very important animal , or an <unk> epidemic , because it 's so important that it is important in the sea .
And I 'd like to close with this photo as an <unk> day in New Zealand , and I was lying on the sea floor in a bunch of coat coat <unk> .
And in the place where I was 20 years ago , I started <unk> .
And I was talking to the hundreds of millions of years of <unk> in the world , and they said that today the ocean is better than 20 years .
And that 's because it 's protected . It 's already <unk> .
So I think information is very clear .
The ocean has <unk> and <unk> , but we have to be good .
I became a swimming photographer because I fell in love with the ocean , and I 'd like to draw her photograph because she would n't want to protect her .
Thank you very much .

And in this brief and positive <unk> , <unk> <unk> shares the vision of his world -- so that the population of <unk> and <unk> will prove that it 's a false population .
community , social change
<unk>
<unk> look at the ice .
I used to be <unk> <unk> .
This is the world that 's been shown in my head -- the population of the temple , the small Earth , everything , all the time .
But I 've been rejected now , because I think it 's about 150 years , we 're going to have a new remix .
And that 's why it is .
You might have seen this , and this is the world population of the U.N.
The world population of the world would hope to be a little less than 100 billion dollars in <unk> .
And then the crowd will go down .
But what about that ?
Most of the <unk> are based on <unk> and extended concepts .
So a lot of economists will think of the population as economic rethink , and even the chimpanzee .
But the population of <unk> is at least two very high effects .
<unk> , the <unk> of the land , plus the population of <unk> , will make the weapon to become a bad venture .
In cities , the large cost of the city is actually <unk> by these values .
<unk> the inner sail , the price of land goes down .
This is also a huge burden of poor people in the world .
Secondly , population population means labor <unk> .
<unk> labor is going to be the increase in <unk> .
And as the increase in the age of <unk> , population population and institutions will speed forwards further .
And of course , I 'm not talking about the same population that 's going to happen in the same way .
But look at what happened in the midst of Europe : <unk> percent of the money in Europe , the introduction of innovation , technology , and the World Department of Sciences , is a very <unk> social movement , like the Renaissance and then the <unk> .
Most of our <unk> tend to depend on the past , to the <unk> color .
All of the religious religions are starting to be the idea of Eden , and then you go through the <unk> , which is an extremely glamorous future .
So the history of human history will be as close as possible , from the present day .
But I think , we 're going to have a change in the next to the top of the curve , when the impact on the <unk> population is affecting the population .
At the time , we 're going to have a good future , rather than <unk> .
But what do we do ?
Why do you talk about social economic advancement ?
Because <unk> always is the most dangerous moment .
And when the <unk> begins , they 're going to make a higher <unk> of <unk> when it comes to the future to become higher .
The fear of the future will cause <unk> .
And if we want to get around the future , we can speed up to the bottom , rather than <unk> .
If we 're very good at the next 150 years , I believe you 've had romantic music that will be completely silenced .
Instead , it 's about the <unk> of the future , and it opens 22 century <unk> .
Thank you .

With complex ecology , biologists <unk> a lot of corn , and in <unk> , there are many chains of habitat to local <unk> to create a blueprint .

Yves <unk> inventories the forest
And one day I came up with my wife , and I sat down in front of the town and I sat down in front of me .
And it 's the most <unk> eye that I 've ever seen .
And what I saw was a very , very nice <unk> baby .
And I went back to that town , and I heard , " Hey , I 've found a lot of <unk> when I was swimming in Bukavu .
This is called <unk> .
And I took this <unk> <unk> , and I had the <unk> of <unk> water until it started to start breathing until they started breathing .
This is <unk> <unk> .
Now we 're living in <unk> <unk> , and this is the second child , <unk> - <unk> kid , actually , in fact , a second <unk> of kids who are <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
This is a dramatic change in my life , and it 's almost a little bit about my own life .
No , no . No . Nope .
That 's bad . This is what we failed , and we ca n't do it in the field .
That 's really bad .
It turns out that everybody 's failed to do what they 're doing .
Almost all of the <unk> have lived all the time in the world , and the chickens are now losing the forest .
In particular , especially for the <unk> oil oil rate , it 's the legitimacy of the Western country that provides these problems .
This is the <unk> <unk> , the largest organic material in the world .
The <unk> <unk> flew into the <unk> , like building a mixture of carbon dioxide , which is going to be a very big amount of CO2 , and my country has become a third of the world 's greenhouse gas .
We 're a nation - state country . That 's just because of the rainforests .
These are scary images .
I 'm not going to talk about it today , but there are lots of people who are struggling with the forest still , but still there is still a process .
And I do n't know what to do in the safe place .
And so I decided to have a solution to <unk> , and this solution led to the same challenge of the deforestation in the forest , which would have to lose the final forest and the habitats .
So I created a place called <unk> <unk> , and my idea is , if I can imagine the worst possible place in my imagination , there 's no place where no one says , " Yeah , but -- but ... "
No . It would be all the way that everybody could come in .
So we 're in <unk> now . That 's where I started .
And as you can see here , there 's only a single <unk> of <unk> .
There 's nothing wrong about what it is .
We have about 50 people in 2002 .
There was a lot of crime .
They spend a lot of money in health and water .
<unk> productivity .
This is the poorest area of <unk> , all of the wildlife plants that have been completely extinct .
It 's like a little desert in biology .
When I stand up here on this lawn , I think it 's not a little exaggeration -- there 's no exaggeration .
Anyway , four years later , we 've got 14 jobs in this country .
There 's climate change . I 'm going to show you : Never <unk> , no cuts .
There are no poorest areas of the poorest , but the biodiversity diversity also has developed .
We 've got more than 1,000 species of birds in the world today .
We have 20 million cellphones .
So what did this happen ? We made a huge economy in the forest .
And basically these seals have gone down .
But we 've seen this .
We use <unk> ; people ca n't afford <unk> <unk> , so they 're burning about half the coast of trees , 50 percent of the independent resources that have happened in a very long period of land .
There are no windows left .
But in this place , you can see the ice on this grass , and you 've got the old office , four years later , a little <unk> on Earth .
There are these animals , these are happy people , and also economic values .
How could this be ?
If you look at this stage , you 'll see it 's very simple : we 've bought this , and then we start <unk> with <unk> and <unk> .
At the time , we built structures , strategies and tactics .
But we have to be sure that every local community is fully governed by this <unk> force .
This is <unk> people into <unk> .
We 're in " people , " and the principles of the Earth , and step further and further , we built a law identity because if the deforestation belongs to the state , it 's a person .
We also use other principles , like <unk> , professionals , purity , <unk> -- and so on .
What we do is we create a goal of how to move from one goal .
You can make a <unk> , whether you can control a liberal arts , whatever , <unk> , or <unk> .
And you see it , and you measure it .
At this point you have the cost of cost .
You know how much money you need to deliver .
If you 're able to get rid of the map , in the <unk> of <unk> , inside the soil , you <unk> these different kinds of shrimp , and if you combine them , it 's a business project , where you can optimize it from the world , to try to optimize that way .
This is what this project looks like . We 're going to get rid of this <unk> .
It 's perfume from <unk> .
<unk> is an economic value that is very low , but we need them to retool the soil and open this <unk> .
Now , eight years later , there might be some <unk> , which means , if you can adapt to the right approach , we can make <unk> <unk> .
This is a technology that 's a very old technology in Japan , but it 's a very easy thing to fall in .
So if we start with <unk> , we have to lose the risk of everything .
So we 've got a little bit of it in the evening , and it 's just going to provide a product of the <unk> .
And this idea is : How do you use a limited tool to work with space in a certain amount of time .
And so we simplify these trees , and simplify the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> in them , in which the debates of trees are <unk> to trees and trees -- organic materials for crops that are good for food , but it also helps to have a lot of money for the water , which is also how much money we can get in the ecosystem , that we can speed the ecosystem .
<unk> . Yves theories .
But is it really so easy ?
No , because if you look at what happened in 1998 , the burning happened .
This is an area about 56 <unk> <unk> .
January .
February .
<unk> .
April .
2008 .
We lost a quarter - acre forest in a few months .
Because we have 10 percent of these underground swimming ice .
Once it 's dry , it goes down , the oxygen goes up , oxygen pads , and the ice goes back .
So how do you break this cycle ?
<unk> is the biggest problem .
This is what it looks like in three months .
Three <unk> , the head of the brain , does n't fall off because it 's black .
We lost all the crop , a hundred years of a child , and they lost 12 <unk> of <unk> ; it was a disaster .
So , the fire is really the first work to do .
That 's why I put it here as a single one .
You need local people , because these <unk> , once you start burning , it 's going to take you to lose the final end of the end , and until the first <unk> <unk> of your day , <unk> the coral <unk> .
So , you have to do it with the community .
These short solutions , you need a long - term solution .
And so we did this in a area of <unk> around the place .
These are the forms of <unk> , the natural natural machinery of a <unk> -- and it provides a lot of revenue for the community .
This looks like this : People are just <unk> in these trees , twice the day , two degrees centigrade , CO2 , carbon dioxide and a little sun .
You make sure that the trees are wired to become <unk> batteries .
Because they 're going to get three times a year , because you can be able to work in a lot of everyday jobs , and you can build a lot of energy from here .
You do n't have to collect organ or anything else .
So this is kind of a genetic explosion that we have in the Gulf of Mexico , and it does n't have been developed by technology .
But also , you have to have good authority .
So we did that , so that 's what we started with this project , in a <unk> .
If you zoom in in a little bit , you can see that all of these regions are covered in different kinds of soil , and in fact , we look at all the trees that are going to be measured , 2,000 miles per gallon .
It 's a very different forest .
And what we really do is we do n't understand nature Nature , and Nature is n't understanding the <unk> , but in the natural world .
This <unk> , the deforestation , can be used in the forest and the surface of the ground , where you can stored more and more carbon .
But this is even more complex , not like the surface , and you need to engage with local groups , working together .
So our activities are <unk> natural , growing fast - growing trees at the same time , and we 're growing up in the presence of growing plants , which is very , very high - scale <unk> , so that it 's a very big diversity that allows them to be able to use the sun as well , that they 're going to get out of the <unk> of a <unk> that goes back and forth in 24 hours .
They 're going to become <unk> .
And you also need the <unk> of the soil , and you have these microbes that you 're going to have .
And then we started to start <unk> -- just a thousand a day .
We can actually have a lot of <unk> , but we do n't want to have the employment that we want .
We do n't want to lose people who are working on fire .
And we have a lot of work to do .
We use the landscape of <unk> plants , and see what plants or birds will grow .
We have <unk> every tree in this region .
This is what it looks like , and what you 're seeing around here is that you have the <unk> of a hundred billion <unk> in the area of <unk> , where you can grow <unk> families .
This is just a small part of this region .
The building is very different .
If you look at trees in our species , like Europe , in the <unk> , from Russia to England , you know how much ?
<unk> .
We 're going to grow 10 more of the species here .
Can you imagine that ?
You have to know what you 're doing , but it 's multi - diversity .
<unk> you to go through the table , <unk> your vegetables and trees , or direct trees directly in the tree , in that <unk> cable , to create every stage of growth , and then making sure that it 's going to grow in each stage .
At the beginning , maybe the apple , the Apple , and corn . Two , second , will be bananas and <unk> . And then there 's a coconut and a leopard .
And then , slowly slowly , trees start to take off , from fruit and from <unk> , extract it from the water .
And then the sun , the skin , is permanent to be permanent .
On the upper left corner , there 's the green <unk> , and you see some <unk> -- these are actually <unk> <unk> .
In these areas , we started <unk> more <unk> , like you 've seen before .
This is what it looks like at a year .
This is two years later .
And if you look at the past , that 's where we start to start .
We simplify the rape and the banana cord , the <unk> , and all the local citizens , but also the trees are growing very rapidly .
So three years later , we have <unk> birds .
We get rid of the <unk> of 140 to five .
It spread 10 percent .
The clouds of clouds -- I 'll show you .
It 's gone .
All the species of crops are <unk> for people .
I 'm building the <unk> , three years ago , a three - year - old .
This is a radio - regulating radio that we collaborated with in Europe , and it brought us to focus on the system that is close to each other .
We use these images to grow up with the forest , and we can fly through the satellites of each tree .
We can now use these sorts of things that we 're working on , and the way we do it and the same technology .
We 've actually done it on Google Earth .
If you want to use a new new technology on the side of the truck , the <unk> system uses Google Earth , and then you can say , " Well , what 's going on here ? "
This is <unk> .
You can go back to the trees , but you also measure it , and you 've got to keep it diversity .
<unk> diversity is a measurable estimate , and it 's measured how much <unk> it is .
And finally , I built it to become a <unk> because the deforestation can start .
There 's a huge amount of water in the city , and it 's about 80 percent of the water around the ocean now and now we have lots of water into <unk> .
Now we 're going to look at the <unk> of the forest , and what we see is <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And look at these images .
I 'll just go very quickly .
In <unk> , the rain rain is not shaped by the shaped , like the <unk> region , where you need to increase the tips from the leaves .
So if you create a <unk> region of the <unk> area , you can have <unk> <unk> .
You see , now it 's increasing <unk> <unk> , which is in the entire three three years .
If you look at the Grand Canyon , it 's been over 20 percent .
If you look at the year , you can see that this trend will continue .
At the beginning , we have <unk> high - speed <unk> , and we 're more <unk> .
And if we look at <unk> patterns , it 's been the most drought place , but now you can see here there 's a <unk> spike here .
So it 's a real change .
And of course , if you have a <unk> form , it 's going to disappear , but when the wind <unk> , you see the <unk> coming back to this region .
So , do n't say what this is , because we actually really change what 's really going to change if you combine a technique .
Technology is really a great , but it depends on people , depending on your education .
We have our agriculture schools .
But indeed , it 's our band , because if you have kids born , we will play , so each person is our family , and you 're not building trouble for your family .
That 's what it looks like .
We have a path to deliver electricity and water .
We 've got <unk> <unk> , and we 're going to have a lot of <unk> in this area that we have in the middle of the world -- we 've offered the spray in this area .
And we have <unk> <unk> , as the gene bank , which keeps all of the materials that live in the past 12 years , because there 's no Jewish <unk> for the <unk> of the past 12 years .
All the seeds are eaten .
So what we 're doing now is <unk> from <unk> , satellite , satellites , etc .
Each feeding family 's family is now going to return to a land .
And it has two good plants for the <unk> tree , and you can grow <unk> in a year in the first year and then planting sugar on the top of the year .
A few years later , you can move through these structures .
And what people do is they get <unk> , and they can be used for building <unk> .
And they can start to get the benefit from the tree .
They also have enough money to support families financially .
But , no matter what you 're doing in this project , you have to be completely supportive of the community , which means that you 've got to engage with the values of cultural values .
It does n't exist everywhere .
You also have to make sure that corruption is hard , and that 's what makes sure .
It 's like <unk> <unk> here , and we 're going to live this area in 20 families .
Maybe one of the members of a member of it is to attract the agreement , and it 's all about the other ones who have to decide how to fix it .
And if you do n't have a team of developers , then other groups have to decide how to deal with the groups that are n't obeying the agreement .
This is a way of collaboration , and they have democracy , so they can use local <unk> systems to protect your system .
So , <unk> , people could sell their land in a year year , but they found jobs , building and <unk> and working with chimps , and they could use <unk> .
They can also get free land in the forest , where they can grow crops .
And now they 're able to sell the <unk> to the <unk> plan .
They get their house on the house , and they sell the <unk> , so we could have a lot of ethanol and energy .
They 're doing all sorts of things in terms of all these other things , money , and they still have education .
All of the stuff depends on the forest .
So if we want to help finance <unk> -- what I do is -- we have to ensure that local people are <unk> .
Now , I think it 's going to work that way , really , very simple , <unk> .
I hope -- if you want to know more , you can read more knowledge .

Yves <unk> builds the city in his hometown of <unk> , and in this process , he changed the <unk> of the world to think about cities .
cities , culture , design , green , humor , sustainability , transportation
<unk>
<unk> <unk> on the city of <unk>
I hope you understand me .
And I said , " Well , I 'm not saying that afternoon , afternoon , I said .
For years , I 've been doing this for a few years .
I 'm increasingly convinced that this is not just a solution , but it 's a way of dealing with climate change .
But we have a very crazy attitude to cities .
I 've worked in cities in the city of 40 years , and every city 's Amsterdam trying to tell me , oh , his cities are huge , or some other mayor will say , we do n't have a military campaign , I think , the world is going to improve in three years .
The size of the size is n't important , and this is not the question of scale , and that 's not the question of migration .
Every problem in the city has no reason to form it , and , of course , the design of the city .
I want to start with this image of a book that I wrote from an adolescent book .
To explain the quality of life , the best example is <unk> because <unk> is a combination of work and life .
When you look at <unk> , he looks like a railway station , and we can imagine , if we get rid of it , it 's much more <unk> .
But this is what we 're doing with our cities , and we live here , working there .
And most of them are ready to leave the city and live in the <unk> .
Another photo is <unk> , which is the car .
He was invited to a party and he did n't want to leave it .
The chair was on the table , and there was a lot of drinking drinking .
He was very <unk> , and he was <unk> with two people , but he always asked more infrastructure .
861
He had a lot of asked .
And then , on the other side , like <unk> , the <unk> bike can <unk> 300 people in Sweden .
<unk> , every city has its own plan .
<unk> , my city , for 30 million people , has spent a lot of money in this city .
Yves Hill : It 's like two <unk> birds .
<unk> , San Francisco -- a very simple market , a <unk> street , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> cities have their design .
But to make it happen , sometimes you have to ask a solution and prepare for a design , and a <unk> , or most people are happy to help you fulfill the way that you 're going to achieve you .
This is the city of <unk> .
This is a piece of work and life .
This is the largest place in the city , and it 's the most focused part of the city .
This is launched in Greenland in 74 years , and we think about 25 percent per day , now , this data becomes two , 200 people every day .
This process takes about 25 years .
That 's what they 're doing . They 're doing very well .
Now , there are <unk> cities around the world who are using what they call <unk> rapid fast .
A little bit : This is important , but it 's not just about your city , not only in every city of the city .
It means that two main problems are really important , and it 's a very important factor for cities .
This is a shopping bus , which is <unk> .
It 's very close to my family .
And if you come to the <unk> , you can go to my house .
This is the development of the transportation community .
And what 's really designed is that those <unk> are the ones who do n't work , and they 're able to work with the cars and work on the air .
That 's why I say this is a <unk> .
This is the design of <unk> , and you can buy <unk> in <unk> .
They can do it with <unk> people .
And yet , what I 'm trying to do is that carbon emissions are mainly the main emissions that are about 50 percent , so we 're only only dependent on our car , so we 're only dependent on the car .
Why do n't we talk about sustainability ?
Is n't that enough ?
Is n't that enough ?
It 's the idea of cities , the design of the city , and this is very important , and it 's a way of teaching kids .
I 'll talk about it later .
And we 're trying to try and make a difference between the transportation .
We started doing this in 1983 , <unk> to Rio , 2012 .
<unk> firms , of course .
And then , 23 years later , they called us to develop -- our plans are growing .
You understand how big it will be , when CNN has this system at a moment .
That 's not the Shanghai garage , she does n't have the Grand Canyon ; she 's just like this one night .
And before you say that this is the design of the <unk> , we design in <unk> .
And that 's how she works . So this is the same system , <unk> <unk> , and it 's this .
So what I 'm trying to do is I do n't try to figure out what 's going on .
And I 'm trying to make a system that we need to combine all of the systems that will never be -- if you have a transportation station , if there 's no transportation , it 's never going to compete on the same space , and it does n't happen in the middle .
When I go back to the car , I always say that cars do n't have to work with her , but she ca n't raise your life .
When you live in the only women in your life , you have a problem .
So all of a sudden , all through the design of design -- <unk> , open - source university , have all these things about the way we teach kids .
If kids learn how to <unk> the junk in six months .
And after that , kids have their parents .
There are 70 percent -- 70 -- 20 years , the world 's junk <unk> .
112
So , education kid .
And I think , if we want to have a sustainable world , we have to improve everything I mentioned , but do n't forget the cities and children .
And I worked in the museum , and I work in a remote city , because you ca n't walk 18 hours a day .
You always need a work between life .
To try to understand the area of the city , the regions where the areas are playing different sorts of different roles in 24 hours .
The other problem is that cities are like our family 's pictures .
We 're not going to draw the family , even though we do n't like the ceiling , because the photo is like you .
All the city can be used more than a photo .
This is walking in the streets , and we 're building it in 72 hours , right .
These are the spikes of different peoples .
This is the portal of the <unk> park , the Hall of <unk> Park , <unk> Hall , German <unk> , Germany .
Suddenly , the Russian <unk> .
Because since we came from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> -- we have to stop this project .
Do n't forget : Have the design come from the budget of the complications .
If you have two two , it 's more creativity .
This is <unk> , and we 're building in two months .
Park -- <unk> <unk> became a city park .
It was a part of the nature of nature , and sometimes , we started <unk> and then <unk> .
And each one can change every flock of birds .
So , in cities , you have to move fast .
<unk> needs time . I 'm doing cities for cities .
It means that I 'm going to work with some focus problems in a lot of attention .
This is an intimate record -- or a <unk> building , some small -- they can make cities better .
Or the <unk> of New York , but the beauty park : only 32 <unk> .
So I want to end up saying that you can normally develop new material , new materials , but remember , we have to move faster , because we 're not so much time to think about it .
I think that creativity and innovation are beginning .
And we do n't find all the answer .
So , when you start -- again , we do n't have all the answers to the answer , and there 's an important contribution for people who can teach you if you do n't have feathers .
And finally , I hope you can help me <unk> .
Okay ?
Please give me for two minutes .
You 've got to sing , <unk> , sing <unk> .
♫ Yeah ! Yves ! <unk> ! ♫ ♫ Ooh , thank you , ♫ <unk> la ! ' ♫ You can do it . ♫ And that 's probably what it 's going to do : ♫ Well , you can achieve it ; you ca n't make it , and you could do this !

In this fiery , interesting 2006 2006 talk , <unk> <unk> , who came up with <unk> lessons from <unk> schools -- to create the conditions of a child .
children , creativity , education , invention

<unk> : <unk> learning revolution !
And I stood here , and I remember in that moment , it was n't the Internet .
I want to talk to you about the <unk> of the box on the ceiling , and the whole box of box , <unk> them , put them right now .
In fact , Chris , the one week in my talk , I said , " We 're ready to put them on the Internet .
Can you put you on the Internet ? " I said , " Yes . "
Four years later , like I said , already already .
Well , it 's been released about four million times .
So I <unk> , I 'm going to take it over 20 or whatever , you know how many people have seen it .
As Chris said , people are really interested in me .
Do n't you think so ?
So this is very encouraging today to be prepared for you .
Yves <unk> had a TEDTalk in the TED conference , and I was four years old to his climate crisis .
In the end of my talk , <unk> him .
So I think I 'm going to start with that , because there are 18 minutes of <unk> .
And I said ...
And you see , he 's right .
I mean , the big climate crisis is , obviously , I think if you do n't believe it , you should think about it .
But I think there 's also a second <unk> crisis , which is very big , and we have to figure out how to process it .
I mean -- but you might say , " Look , I 'm good .
I have a climate crisis ; I do n't need second second . "
But this is the crisis , and it 's not a priority , even though I believe it really exists in a crisis .
I believe that fundamentally , like many of the speakers in the last few days , we did n't use our talent .
A lot of people look at their entire life , and it 's not their inheritance , or they do n't say anything about them .
I 've met all sorts of people , they do n't think they 're good .
In fact , I 've got to put it into two groups .
Yves <unk> , famous <unk> philosopher , was against this argument .
And he said , " There are two people around the world , one person is divided into two , and another one does n't do that . "
I have to admit .
I 've met all sorts of people , and they do n't like what they 're doing .
They 're easy to have their lives , just to cope with them .
They feel very pleasant from their work .
And they 're <unk> it , not just for the weekend .
But I 've also met people who love their jobs , even if they 're doing something else .
And if you say , " Do n't do this . " They 're hard to understand what you 're saying .
Because that 's not what they 're doing , because they say , " But this is me , you know .
If I give it to it , I 'm really stupid because that 's my real real self - <unk> <unk> . "
A lot of people do n't think so .
In fact , <unk> , I think it 's not just a single part .
I think there 's a lot of explanation .
The most likely explanation is that education is education , because it 's a lot of people in a certain way .
It 's like <unk> , and they 're usually hidden .
You have to look for them . They 're not just lying on the surface .
You have to create something that self - reflection .
You might think that education is the atmosphere that teaches them , but lots of times .
Every education system in the world is <unk> . This is n't enough .
<unk> is no longer a values , because it 's just a simple improvement .
What we need is -- this word is already used in the last few days -- not evolution , but education .
It must be <unk> into other forms .
One of the most significant challenges of education is a completely dynamic .
<unk> is <unk> , because it means that people are not very easy to do it in most cases .
It means that real challenge is that we think it 's obvious .
It 's the largest problem in the form of <unk> or reform , which is social <unk> , people think , " It ca n't be done in other ways . "
I suddenly remembered the classic sentence of <unk> <unk> , and I think he had to be happy with his sentence .
And he was at the second stage in <unk> .
I would n't tell you what happened . I did n't know .
We 're in the U.K.
We <unk> it , you know , that 's our policy .
Because , of course , a glamorous thing happened in <unk> , in December of 12 , and the American people would know what I said .
And he said , " Take the past <unk> and storms .
It 's a very high amount of <unk> , and we have to progress with time . "
I love that .
Not for it , but five minutes .
Our example is new , we have to rethink .
We have to hire ourselves and save our country . "
I love this word .
You know what it means ?
We 're all <unk> to these ideas , and we 're very simple about it , as opposed to things like nature .
A lot of our ideas are formed , and they 're not going to interact with the physical environment of the century , but only for the 20th century .
But our idea remains <unk> . We have to come from some of those .
It really is more easy than doing .
It 's hard to know , if you say , what do you think ?
And , why you think it is for granted .
So let me ask you some questions , and you might think that 's Isaac <unk> .
How many of you have this ?
That 's not me , I think you 're familiar with this .
Do anybody have to do that without 25 years ?
All right , those are more than 25 years old , if you take a <unk> on your hand .
<unk> us , right ?
The same problem is the young people in the room .
Young people do n't have feathers .
I 'm not saying that they ca n't be either either , they do n't make it .
That 's why you look at these 25 years old , and we 're growing up in a number of years ago .
Because for us , if you want to know about time , you have to bring you to you .
The kids are now in the digital age , and it 's everywhere .
They do n't understand why to take a look .
By the way , you do n't need it ; it 's because you 're used to do it .
My daughter never took a watch , my daughter , 20 years old .
She does n't see the importance of the Einstein .
She said , " This is a single functional device . "
It 's a lot of <unk> .
And I said , " No , no , it also shows the time . "
" It has a lot of function . "
But you see , this is what we 're taught .
Let me give you one example .
One of them is the linear idea of linear ideas : From here , you 're going to move on a orbit , if you do what you want to do .
Everyone in the TED talks , <unk> told us , sometimes in different stories , life is not linear , it 's organic .
We 've created our lives , as we see our talent , and talent help us create self - help .
But you know , we 're very excited about this linear story .
It could be the pinnacle of education .
I think we 're going to get people to go into university .
There are some university .
I 'm not saying that you should n't be college , but nobody needs university , especially right now .
They could n't get college before they did that .
I 've had a lot of them at the airport .
There was a 30-year man who bought my book .
And I said , " What are you doing ? "
And he said , " I 'm a cousin . "
And I said , " How much do you get ? "
And he said , " Life , I 've always been a sucker . "
I said , " Oh , when you decide what ? "
And he said , " It 's a very small time . " He says , in fact , I 've got a lot of money in school because of the school .
And he said , " I want to become a cousin . "
And he said , " When my <unk> is tall , my teachers are <unk> .
There 's a teacher .
And he said , if this is my entire choice , I 'm losing my birthday , and I should be in college , a big professional , which I have to do . "
And he said , " Make me feel <unk> , because the teacher says , I feel bad .
But that 's what I want to do , from the end of the helicopter , and I 've been inspired by <unk> . "
And he said , " You know , before you ask me for a few seconds , I remember that the teachers . " He says , ' Because six months ago I saved his life . "
And he said , " He 's in a serious car with a severe injury , and I 've taken him out of his heart , to give him his wife . "
And he said , " I think he 's going to make a lot of stuff right now . "
You know , the human society depends on the diversity of talent , not a single capabilities .
The center of our challenge -- in our middle , our ability to challenge our capabilities and wisdom .
<unk> is a problem .
I was nine years old .
And when I came to this painting , I had a sense of thinking about a point of view , which was very , very big , " <unk> nurture . "
No , no , no .
Not that .
If I have time , I 'll tell you , but I do n't .
kindergarten was born in kindergarten .
One of my friends once said , " You know , one three - year - old , not one half . "
They were three years old .
As we heard here , we 've heard a lot about kindergarten , especially for young students , three years old .
And kids sat in a boring expert , and you know , you 've got to get rid of their <unk> . And they say , " That 's all that ? "
" You 've got 36 months . Are you doing this ? "
" You do n't have anything , that 's my recommendation .
That 's six months old , and this is what I can see . "
Now , this idea is incapable of <unk> , but it attracted us .
Another big problem is <unk> .
We built our education system on fast food systems .
Yves <unk> once mentioned this question .
You know , there are two modes of <unk> that allow you to have the high - intensity <unk> .
One is fast , and all the <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> hotels , <unk> <unk> , they have standards for the local .
We 've come up with our own lives , and we build fast - food education , which is the <unk> of our <unk> and our energy , the energy , as fast as fast as the <unk> .
I think we have to know something about it .
<unk> is a huge diversity of diversity .
They have a very different <unk> .
And I found a thing recently : I got a guitar in a very young age , probably Eric <unk> .
You know , Eric <unk> won , and I think it is .
In some ways , it does n't work on me .
I ca n't work for the brush , or even more .
It 's not work .
Not just that .
It 's about passion .
Often , people are really excited about what they 're doing .
It 's passion , allowing us to be more excited .
And if you 're doing what you want to do , it 's to prove that you 're good at doing these things .
My wife has been doing a novel , and I think it 's a terrific book .
You know , if you 're doing what you love , one hour is like five minutes .
If you 're doing something that does n't work with you , five minutes per hour .
A lot of people who are left - educated is that education is not responsible for their quality of their energy .
So I think we have to change <unk> .
We have to rely on <unk> patterns from <unk> , based on the point of linear , <unk> and mass people .
We have to rely on the model that agriculture produces .
We have to recognize that human beings are not an industrial manufacturing process , a organic process .
And you ca n't predict the results of human development .
All of you can do it , like a crop , building them .
So , when we look at <unk> and change forms , it 's not <unk> a system .
It 's like <unk> , wonderful systems .
There 's a lot of cool patterns .
It 's the <unk> of people who really teach you , personal education .
And I think that this is the answer to the future , because it is n't a new solution ; it 's about building education , and people develop their own solution , but they 're based on personal conditions .
Now , in this room , people represent amazing resources in the theater , on multimedia , at the Internet .
These technologies , the brilliance of the teachers , provides a chance to educate the evolution of education .
I encourage you to participate in this , because it 's incredibly important , not just for us , but for our kids .
But we have to bring it from industrial mode mode , which is that every school is <unk> tomorrow .
It 's a experience of kids .
Or home , if that 's where they and his friends picked their friends .
In the last few days , there 's a lot of controversy about the dream .
I just want to be quickly .
Natalie <unk> 's poetry in my head , <unk> <unk> .
I want to read a quick short poem from <unk> B B , which is someone you might know .
He wrote his love , <unk> , and he 's going to do it for the truth , he ca n't really make her , and he thinks she wants to do what she 's trying to tell her . "
And he said , " I have something else , but it does n't give you . "
And he said , " heaven 's got rid of the clothing , with perfect light and <unk> lights , the blue , dark , <unk> <unk> , and with <unk> light , I 'm going to move the laundry to you ; it 's very poor , but I 've moved my dreams , because you 're looking at my dream . "
And every day , our children came up with their dreams .
We 're going to zoom in .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
How do n't we cope with nuclear power ? In this fiery Zen of wisdom , peace <unk> explains the skills that we need -- the National <unk> and the individual , the way to fight <unk> violence , and how to deal with the <unk> of the wild violence -- <unk> <unk> , who says , " Why do <unk> work in the world .
<unk> , activism , global issues , peace , productivity , violence , war
<unk>
Yves <unk> : <unk> fight
And I was always a question of what was going on for war to prevent war : How do we treat extreme violence ?
When you 're faced with violence , whether it 's a child 's face , or a <unk> of violence or Syria , what is the most efficient way of doing it ?
<unk> ? <unk> ?
Use more violent ?
" How do I do that ? "
Since I was a child , I had my kids .
And I remember that when I was about 13 years old , my parents were surrounded by the <unk> room of the boat , and I had a lot of kids who were going to hit the table and have a big amount of children before the temperature of a tree .
And I went on my toes of my <unk> .
And mother said , " What are you doing ? "
I said , " I 'm going to go to <unk> . "
She said , " Why . "
I said , " They 're killing those kids .
There are some terrible things happening . "
She said , " No matter . "
And I started crying .
She learned , " I know this is serious .
But you 're too small .
You have to train . Let me help you .
But let 's put it down . "
And then I got some training and I worked in 20 <unk> of Africa .
But I realized that what I really need to do is that I do n't have a lot of training from those training .
I want to know what violence is , depression .
I found that <unk> uses three <unk> .
<unk> violence is <unk> , the physical violence , the spiritual violence .
They do n't do much more violent .
<unk> Nelson Mandela believed the war when he was born , and 27 years later , he talked to the <unk> of a <unk> government as a tool for a democracy .
And they do it in a completely violent way .
They found that <unk> did n't work .
So what works ?
I 've got a lot of work in these years , and there are many ways of doing it .
The first is to change the change .
My response to depression is that I have to control , and I can do something .
What I need is growth .
That means that when I look at how to balance , I 'm going to tell you what it is , my <unk> .
When did I replicate ?
What do I do ?
<unk> or self - <unk> is an approach -- of course , it 's not the only way to get that force .
Ninety - eight percent of the heroes in <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
She 's the leaders of a group of students who are in <unk> .
They 're facing a <unk> .
She immediately realized that the <unk> soldiers in <unk> were even worse than younger students .
But she told her , she sat down .
And she went to the first <unk> meal , and she brought her first door to her hands , put her hand on the door .
All security is safe .
This is the control that controls fear -- it 's not only when you meet the <unk> , but as you get out of the way .
But we have to practice .
So what do we fear ?
I have a <unk> .
I 'm afraid , my risk of fear .
If fear is too big , bad things happen .
We all know about three <unk> in the morning , and when you worry about you , I see a lot of people who are afraid you 're afraid of a hour and then he gets worse , you 've got a <unk> wake up .
And the only thing that can do is to do it , <unk> , calm tea , and with fears .
You 're a adult .
And fear is like kids .
You talk to fears , and you ask him what he wants .
How does this work ?
How does this kid become stronger ?
And then you have a plan .
You say , " Okay , we 're going to sleep .
<unk> and <unk> , we 'll stop . "
And in the Sunday Times , I had this experience that was paralyzed by fear .
So I did .
I ca n't wait for me . I sit down and sit , and so on , so I 'm here -- still <unk> , but I am here .
So this is fear . What is the anger ?
There 's no violent anger .
But Nelson bears look like gasoline , and if you look at oil , you have a <unk> , which you 're in hell .
But as the engine , anger is very powerful .
And if we can put anger in the engine , he 's going to take us forward , and he can get us out of the tragic moment , allowing us to real power .
I knew this in my work with nuclear power .
Because I was very upset about the dangers that I had to offer for us , and I 'm going to ask them to make them wrong .
It does n't work .
To start a conversation , we need to engage our anger .
It 's very upset that the <unk> is very normal , but the anger is no option .
And they are people like us .
They think they think right .
And that 's where we communicate with them .
So that 's the third , anger .
Now we came up with the core of this conference , and that 's what 's happening in this world , right in the last century .
The government always told people what to do .
This century has changed .
This is now a bottom line of power or <unk> .
Think of mushroom pressure from concrete .
As <unk> says , people are connected together .
This project has been discovered very quickly in the area of conflict .
They know what the best they do .
So peace is acting for them .
And what they did was they <unk> military personnel , <unk> the economy , the <unk> , even <unk> children .
They have to take risks for these things .
They 've realized that in these situations , it 's not much more <unk> , but it does n't have to work with each other .
And I think that the U.S. forces begin to understand those things starting to understand .
They 're always killing the people who are killed by the <unk> , and if you get rid of it , it will be recorded by <unk> .
And this <unk> and <unk> the Afghan , and so , when people get caught in the <unk> , it 's very easy to expand .
So makers have to change .
I think there 's now change now .
British forces have done great .
Now they have a good hint of description , which is a Middle East , Chris .
And he 's carrying his people in Iraq -- they 're <unk> from the streets of the street , screaming , scream , <unk> and <unk> , and the soldiers do n't know what 's going to happen .
And Chris <unk> went to the middle of the population , and she said , " <unk> <unk> . "
And then the license to run their shoulder up to the underside of their <unk> and their <unk> .
There is no sound .
Two minutes later , groups go home .
That 's what I think is intelligence .
At the moment , that 's what he did .
It 's going to happen in every place .
Do n't you believe me ?
Have you asked yourself why and how many governments have gone through the last 30 years ?
In <unk> , <unk> Estonia , Ernest , West , Mali , the <unk> and the mid - <unk> -- and I can continue to continue , and now I could continue and go and get , well , what <unk> or Egyptians .
That does n't happen .
A lot of them because it 's a book that 's been written in the Boston age of the Boston temple .
It 's called " <unk> , " from the <unk> to democracy .
This book is <unk> in 26 languages .
This is now in the world .
This book is used over the world , because it 's very efficient .
And this book gives me hope -- it 's not just what I feel right .
Because people ended up doing it .
We can use practical , practical methods to answer my questions : How do we do it against threat ?
We 're talking about the way that you 're saying : <unk> power , self - awareness of understanding and to use our fears , to <unk> the <unk> , with the people who relate to other people , to collaborate with others , with the most important , gender - and - a - art struggle .
Now I do n't believe that <unk> is violent .
I do n't believe it .
I 've been seeing how it works everywhere .
Now I see , we , personally , can do <unk> <unk> , seals , Gandhi , with Nelson Mandela .
We can end up with the most <unk> times of mankind .
We can do it through our heart to try to get rid of the <unk> of <unk> .
This openness of openness is that I feel from the entire gathering of the whole conference .
Thank you .
<unk>
<unk> Anderson : <unk> his pendulum from traditional , <unk> , waste - by - profit successes , and in this talk , he 's very modest in sharing a big picture about sustainability .
business , design , environment , green , materials , media , sustainability , technology
<unk>
<unk> Anderson : Why business can do that .
No matter , I 'm going to do a lot of problems here for solving the problems that we 're facing , but today I want to tell you about the effects of the climate .
The solution that I 'm going to offer is to give you a huge amount of damage to the planet , and the destruction of our biosphere .
It 's because of the city of industrial and business , and this is what I did when I graduated from <unk> <unk> .
I was a industrial engineer , and I went from the road to <unk> to entrepreneurs .
I 've created the Internet company , which is since 1973 , in 1998 , when we 're going to build a carpet for <unk> , and our <unk> are the foundation of the business company and the research Foundation , where I went through the corporate world to live in the process of <unk> to the world .
In the book , Paul will call the <unk> of the force and the industrial industry , and that business company is the only market that has enough markets and forces to remix human institutions .
By the way , in the generation , Paul called me Earth 's resources .
And then I came up with a challenge to my company , and I wanted to bring our firms to sustainable progress , we have a new amount of company that we do n't use , which is the Earth 's resource , it 's not going to get rid of the way we use it .
Not natural . It does n't hurt it .
And I 'm just simply saying , " If Paul is right , what should you be doing ? "
If nobody becomes a leader , nobody will do it .
It sounds very simple . Why do n't we become leaders ?
And thanks to the support of <unk> , I have now <unk> from the environment to become environmental <unk> .
And I told the author of the Fortune magazine , and I said that maybe people have been dumped .
And that interview came in the cover of " <unk> . "
And they called me the most American CEO .
From <unk> to the leading CEO of the United States to <unk> , it 's also about five years of <unk> irony for the American talent in 1999 .
And then the documentaries of Canada took me to the <unk> Foundation , and they asked me , " Well , what I mean is that the car is a <unk> .
The future wealth will become a kind of <unk> .
But I realized that it 's going to be a nonprofit wealth of wealth , and we have to figure out a way to make an alternative simulation of the world to become the <unk> of human culture -- the production of <unk> - <unk> <unk> , because this is the same thing that <unk> our kids , that we 've got our children in the house , which is a very , very good thing to do with <unk> and then <unk> the resources to the bridge .
It 's the <unk> of the Earth 's resources , and there 's a very famous algorithm that 's <unk> -- this is a bad thing , it 's population , wealth and technology .
<unk> , affected by people who are brought to people from people , and the way the products of the products .
Despite this formula , you might be able to calculate the population of population and wealth , but usually technology is very difficult .
Or this formula is <unk> .
But it can still help us understand problems .
And the interface companies start to create a new way of building structures in 1994 , creating a carpet that 's going to require a lot of oil and energy , and we need to change our technology as much as it is to increase them , rather than increase those effects .
Paul and Annie <unk> , the human population , wealth and technology .
I hope that the Internet companies can re - write this formula : I 'm <unk> T - A .
If you 're really good , you can see that T is going to increase the influence of influence -- which is bad , but if the T - <unk> is a <unk> .
And so I asked , " Well , if you look at the level of <unk> , what we hope is that this <unk> can expand and increase the impact , and we want to reduce it . "
I think some of the characteristics that the Industrial Revolution is .
<unk> : Making resources from Earth .
E : <unk> , production , waste .
It 's about fossil fuels .
It 's also wasteful : it 's <unk> and only depends on the production of workers .
We just want one hour to make a more <unk> .
So , I think I have to put it in the <unk> .
In the new technological Revolution , from <unk> , you have to use <unk> to move to the fossil flow from fossil fuels into a fossil fuel consumption from zero waste to zero energy from a zero - zero approach to low energy production .
And I think , if we can make these changes , it 's going to be completely <unk> , and we 're able to reduce our influence in less than zero .
This is also the strategy of the Internet company , in 1995 , in <unk> .
We 're very upset about computational calculations per year .
So I can tell you what 's going on in the last 12 years from 94 years .
The growth of the greenhouse gas has dropped down to the <unk> .
In the same time , it took two thirds of productivity , turnover doubled .
It 's about 90 percent of the greenhouse gases that are coming from the product of the product .
This is a huge number of people in the world who need to know and have the figures before 2050 , and we can avoid catastrophic climate crisis .
Because the uses of energy in the interface , the use of fossil fuels can reduce 60 percent .
We found that the cheapest oil , which is the non - efficient oil that used to be fully autonomous .
Our company is down to 75 percent of the total global production that we have in our businesses .
We 've got the water that we 're going to do about 40 percent of the production of water , and that 's where we go back in the ' 60s .
And the ratio of <unk> is about 25 , and it 's about 25 percent .
The amount of energy in renewable energy is going to go to 100 percent .
We also also have the old <unk> of <unk> , four million <unk> from the inside of the boat , from <unk> back to the ground , and we 've managed by <unk> with <unk> and recycling - success . And we did n't start at the beginning .
These are new technologies that have been created by <unk> 400 feet since 2004 , which means that , from the result , it 's not going to fall out of the process of climate change , and the amount of ice that goes through our supply is to spread through the whole atmosphere of <unk> to the entire <unk> of our <unk> .
We call it cool .
And in the middle of the market , it becomes growth in <unk> and profits .
Three years ago , we launched the names of the house , called " <unk> , " which is a mistake -- <unk> -- <unk> - <unk> .
You can see more and more introduce in <unk> , and you can get it out of the way , five days .
It 's very practical , it 's beautiful .
And I think we 're going to get halfway through that goal , which is " zero , zero footprint . "
In 2020 , we 're going to be able to go " <unk> <unk> " in 2020 .
We called it " zero . "
This is probably the most important side that we found , and we 've found that zero missions is a huge amount of force .
And you can get better businesses to do better .
That 's where sustainability grows .
It 's from my experience , and we actually see the cost of cost , not just from the numbers , but it 's about four billion dollars in the process , which is that we have four billions of dollars .
This is the cost of cost cost for our company .
This example is also <unk> people to think about economic and environmental systems .
The products that we 're creating are <unk> because they 're designed by the principle of <unk> , which is the design of the use of sustainable creativity .
Our employees are also equally exciting for this .
There is no better response to the <unk> and unity of the community .
And the <unk> of the market is amazing .
Anything that does n't work in any other way , or whether it works or do n't have to do that , or do n't get it .
I 've talked about the cost of cost , products and markets , what does n't talk about ?
I think this is better business .
This is a sell that we 're 14 years old .
From the time from 2001 to 2003 , we went down to <unk> .
But the market for <unk> is down to the <unk> .
So we actually won the market .
If we do n't have sustainable strategies , maybe we 're not going to live in that recession .
And if each of these industries goes to us , should we solve all kinds of problems ?
I do n't think so .
I 've often been fascinated by this equation called Guide to <unk> A.
This is what 's called the <unk> , which means wealth itself .
But if we look at this <unk> <unk> ?
If we compare the <unk> A A to a <unk> , and so therefore , one means that money is just one of the way that wealth is going to be a moral , less <unk> , less <unk> .
This may take us to think about human beings -- and we do n't even have the same economy in the world , at least for the rest of the species of human life , to live in a limited world that is limited to the <unk> , the pleasure of <unk> and natural nature , <unk> or <unk> .
But is the Earth just waiting for humanity ?
It might be . But I do n't see it .
Our interface companies are really wanting to bring us into this sustainable , low - cost industrial company .
And we 've seen the path to see the way to the <unk> path .
So what you need to do is to leverage .
Like my good friends , <unk> <unk> , said , " If something else exists , it 's possible . "
And if we can do that , that 's possible .
If we have a big deal of oil , anyone can do it .
If anyone could do anything , anyone can do it .
<unk> inspired humanity to the bottom of the abyss because we 've gone through the past long long days of life , which is non - <unk> dangerous .
Who is the person ?
Not you . It 's not me .
Let me tell you who 's dangerous .
I had this guy at the top of the ice .
And that 's a Tuesday morning in 1996 , when I went to the crowd , and I was always doing it so that I would tell them that they were building new relationships .
When I went back to Atlanta , I received a email from a gentleman named <unk> Thomas , and I met one of the conference in California .
And he gave me a poem that he wrote after the Tuesday Tuesday .
And I felt like I had a lot of fun in my life when I was a kid .
And I told me , someone 's got it .
This is what it does .
" And he 's the most dangerous person in the face , <unk> , " <unk> kids . "
" No one , no face , a <unk> , <unk> - <unk> child , and a Tuesday morning , I met you .
The wisdom of the wisdom is <unk> us .
From his heavy view , I saw the day you saw it , and it was n't me .
Because you change my thinking .
I never thought about what I did , and maybe one day would hurt you .
My daughter , my son , I started thinking about you , and you 're going to have a good life , even though I know what I want to think .
I 'll start .
I 'm always thinking , I do n't have anything that I 've lost , and I forgot to have a day and you 're going to live there . "
At the day , every day of my day is <unk> , it 's going to give me a simple and profound information that I want to share with you .
We 're all part of life .
It 's a part of the human race , and it 's all about <unk> .
And we 're very short at this <unk> , and our journey is short , we have to make choice .
For you , this is what you call your call .
Thank you .

As art works for <unk> <unk> , Ben Cameron is arguing about the art of art -- 20 theater , live music , and how the romantic dance is in the Internet ?
arts , education , entertainment , performance
<unk>
Ben Cameron <unk> 's real truth
I 'm a culture - old man . Every day , I 'll give you a bank of iPod , <unk> and Mozart , and <unk> <unk> , which is a very , very impressive <unk> .
I 'm still reading <unk> , from <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> <unk> . "
I 'm also a service nut , and I 'm looking at the DVD of the television show , with lots of TV .
My favorite , " Law and <unk> : " special poetry " and " <unk> " or " 30 " " -- " The " Chief " is ultimately the end . "
And I think there 's a lot of people who are passionate about me , especially the passion of the <unk> judge , which is a passionate passion for the person who wants to take away from us . But I do n't believe you have the core passion , but I 'm not sure that you 've all had the same kind of passion .
<unk> , a lot of people who work in this field are worried about the fact that the threat is coming from the dangers of technology .
And the first time we think about the Internet is that it 's amazing to think of all the problems that we 're all going to understand , and we realize that the Internet is going to <unk> .
And according to what you know , a art organization , or a artist , trying to attract a potential note , and it needs three to 500 different <unk> every day .
Now we know that technology is essentially the biggest <unk> of our lives .
Five years ago , the <unk> generation spent 18 hours of <unk> and television , mainly television .
The <unk> generation spent more time in the generation of generations -- <unk> hours .
Now , a typical college freshmen spent a few hours in school , and 10,000 hours to run the video video games , which remind us that we 're in a video game than music and film .
And we worry about technology changing our cultural consumption .
Thank you for the Internet , we believe that we 're going to get out of the way .
We 're able to wrestle in three or nine times the <unk> of the day at the bottom of the day .
To give you a sense of traits and customization with <unk> -- needs a lot of theater timing , <unk> the workplace , to the <unk> , the parking place -- no .
We 're all <unk> realizing : what does it mean when we make a hundred hundred dollars to buy the <unk> , or the CEO of a <unk> or an octopus , and when cultural consumers are used to use the Internet , when it 's a person in the other day of the brain , ?
And we have a lot of problems in this area in this area .
But we have a strange sensation , we know we 're not alone .
We 're working together with the fundamental <unk> of culture and communication , this remix , <unk> , magazine , articles , books and literature , etc .
We <unk> , by the age of 14 , to stop this agreement , often <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and spread , and we 're stuck in a huge amount of buildings , where these buildings are designed to make the artists and audiences in the 19th century , in this pattern , that we need to have high productivity in that pattern .
A lot of us in " <unk> <unk> " and we asked ourselves , " Are we next ? "
Every single project that I talked about in the art of the <unk> Declaration , <unk> <unk> , who said , " Well , we 're in a society that has no language , no law .
And whatever we 're doing is completely <unk> .
We 've never seen a few years before . "
For those of you who are passionate , whether you 're going to be here , light , <unk> ?
Now , it 's not just the edge of the <unk> , I 'm sure that we 're dealing with <unk> reform , like <unk> in the 16th century .
Art reform , like <unk> , is <unk> by technology , actually by <unk> religious Revolution .
In wealthy arguments , inside the body self - <unk> , the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
In fact , I think that these two statements come together : who has the <unk> to reform ?
How do they get permission ?
In fact , what do we need to do with <unk> gods ?
Chris Anderson : I think you all know that he 's the founder of <unk> magazine and " <unk> " by <unk> <unk> , who is the first focused on this person .
At a long time , you know , he wrote about the internet , the <unk> , and the size of the Internet , so thank you , this is the art product of the art .
In the 1930s , if anyone in the 20th century , you need to have a film , and you have to do a lot of money for Wikipedia , or <unk> -- because they 're able to offer the photography of photography , because they 're able to offer the camera <unk> , the <unk> and the gut ?
And now the people in this room do n't know a 14 year - old kid who 's trying to make her second , third or <unk> film ?
Similarly , this means that art is spreading in the first generation of human history .
Again , in the early ' 30s , Warner Brothers , or <unk> movies , for you to do these art .
Now , to YouTube , Facebook Facebook ; you can do n't leave your own <unk> spaces in the world .
And this dual effect led to a significant recovery of the cultural market , which is the moment of <unk> makers .
And that 's honestly what we 're going to see in the world , when the whole world is changing , we get closer from the patient .
But the number of people in the arts , the people who are singing , singing <unk> , <unk> church , are not aware of the speed of progress .
And this group , you call it the " professional " artist approaching a professional <unk> .
You can see them in YouTube , in dance , and so on .
They 're going to be completely separate from the notion that our aesthetic minds are <unk> , and they 're <unk> and <unk> the culture of our traditional institutions .
And finally , we 're living on definition of definition , rather than consume .
But I want to try to figure out , as <unk> <unk> did n't end up , or <unk> , I believe that our art is going to continue to continue something important .
Now these institutions are still a great way to do a spectacular job of the economy , not rich , but the economy .
And in these places where these are necessary , they have to have a range of resources to find out .
But as you think of them as <unk> , it 's not glamorous .
And in fact , it 's about five years from where we 're interested in <unk> , to the most exciting progress of success , which is the rise of professional artists , and these accidents are n't in the halls of the Hewlett - <unk> or the <unk> and the public , or <unk> -- and they 're not going to be able to do the demand for the economy , but the world is not doing the need to work at the traditional art , or the <unk> of the traditional art .
The dance of romantic romantic world is not just based on the Royal <unk> or Canada , but <unk> <unk> , the dance singer , and the <unk> of <unk> -- and this is an ongoing professional dance company , which is a <unk> - old career , a company of 18 to 10 years old , to <unk> the origin of the DNA .
The professional theater community is not defined by <unk> and <unk> , but it 's based on the building of Los Angeles , which is an artist that 's a artist , and in 9/11 , the <unk> of the Japanese and the Jews , in the nine - year - old , <unk> - <unk> social community -- and they 've managed to make a difference between the fact that they 're creating their own individual and a large <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Now , the creator , <unk> Jones , was working in <unk> , helping women to help the cries of suffering , and now the <unk> and the chief of the generation of <unk> are working with a young <unk> .
In fact , I think it 's not about the art of <unk> , and it is in the middle of a time where we 're going to have a lot of important important things in this era .
We emphasize that we 're very important about the health care industry in the town .
It 's absolutely important . I hope you know , every dollar of the art of everyday art is about 70 dollars per dollar , and the amount of money that goes on the restaurant , the money in the hospital , we 're able to buy the same money for the <unk> -- and we do it in a laser , to <unk> the piano and so on , so we 're going to employ for the instrument to raise the piano <unk> and and so on .
But as we launched , art will be more important for the economy , especially the industrial industry , as they do n't even think about the iPod , it 's a few people , and if we have some , you can predict 10 and 15 years later .
The business leaders are going to depend on <unk> , seriously listening , self - change , <unk> the ability to <unk> others -- every time a museum can grow these real skills .
And especially today , we have to confront <unk> markets for resilience , <unk> social psychology , and we need to use the power of art to create the force of the art and the quality of our nation , especially the characteristics of a lot of young people , rather than <unk> .
And finally , especially in the world today , we live in a floating and complex migration on television , where we 're going to have a lot of <unk> on the TV , and in an <unk> environment , there 's no way to hear it every day , in every <unk> , every eight days of every generation , each hunter can hear , " Listen , ladies and <unk> .
Whether it 's done , regardless of the art , when art brings us together , art provides us with generous and curious ways .
God knows that if we have this capacity in human history , we need it now .
We connect together , I think it 's not because technology , entertainment , design , but a common reason .
We 're trying to build a healthy and dynamic social society to reduce the pain of humanity , to make a more sustainable , more emotional and more <unk> .
I 've been striving for all of the people who are trying to <unk> , and I hope you excuse you to embrace what art is doing , whatever your intention is .
And I 'm promised to you , from the future to <unk> <unk> Foundation , where it 's going to merge with the <unk> Foundation , and it 's going to merge with it .
Thank you very much for your talk and kindness to the afternoon .
Thank you , <unk> <unk> .

We 're here to talk about different ideas -- he thinks that music should come from mind .
That 's the <unk> of the 20th century , and it 's not the most popular thing in the inner world .

He keeps beautiful music .

Bill <unk> on PowerPoint slide
So , thank you .
There 's a good news , and I 'm very aware that I 've got a lot of responsibility for you , because I 'm the only barrier between you .
All right , I 'm not ready for a long talk , but I have a big slide here .
I have some of my life to describe my life and how to live .
And my experience to me is that people can be able to forget about the text , and remember the content . So I hope you 'll remember some of the photos that I 'm going to share with you .
The story begins here -- when I was a student at a high school student , life lived in a <unk> , everybody was singing hope .
In a afternoon afternoon , I went to school in school , trying to think about your own <unk> , and this artist was doing a huge old old age in the classroom , so I was looking at the door of the art to see how you 've ever seen how to make it , which is magic that I 've seen in my life .
So I went into art class and said , " What 's this ? "
And he said , " <unk> , who are you ? "
I said , " I 'm Bill <unk> , and I want you to make this happen . "
And he said , " Okay , let 's give your administrators to a list , and you can tell you , I 'll teach you . "
So , my final two years , I <unk> all my courses .
But I was very afraid , and I gave the teachers to <unk> my teachers . They gave me a lot .
That 's what I did for school .
<unk> said , " Well , you 're not going to leave my mailbox for my <unk> , and I 'll leave you with <unk> school . "
And then he drove me to the <unk> university , and I took a <unk> in which I did it .
And I 'm now in the field of this college lawn , and I said , " I grew up traveling around the neighborhood to get into this university .
Do n't give you the poor , because you never know what 's going on . "
I 'm going to use it for a few minutes to show you one of the most <unk> blocks in the <unk> of <unk> .
Peter Lee , this is an <unk> for mom and <unk> , <unk> mother and her mother .
Remember the <unk> for the first time ?
Now there 's no way to create the <unk> of the past , in a lifetime of people 's lives .
I <unk> them , give them new lives .
<unk> <unk> is in our neighborhood .
In the way , I 've been rejected by the <unk> of the helicopter , and he 's going to be there in the midst of a season , where I built <unk> <unk> , which I quickly knew , as long as it was .
Yves Vision is <unk> .
I was on his <unk> last year , and this whole life would be <unk> him .
I 've found one of the students with <unk> <unk> , who gave him the center of a world - class center , and it 's in the worst area .
My center is the ratio of <unk> <unk> .
When you come to the Grand Canyon , you have <unk> versions of my architecture .
This is my building .
It 's built in a <unk> neighborhood .
And I think , if you want to deal with the lives of people who have already been considered , you 're more likely to look at the way that you 're going to solve the problem , rather than the issue of problems .
You see , there 's a bottle in the yard .
And <unk> did a bottle of water , and I did my idea . I bought a <unk> .
Now , I 'm going to talk to you about a lot of TED meetings , and they 've got me to join the Inuit .
And in the yard of the museum , I saw that there was a water that had a bottle of water because they thought they would get a cow .
Well , I think there 's a child who 's going to make care of the lives of my mother , unfortunately , with a <unk> .
So the first time you 've seen that in my center , you 're waiting for your <unk> -- <unk> - life life . It 's very clear that you do n't have the attitudes and expectations .
So I started to start this piece from the water .
As you can see , it has the art of the world , and it 's perfect , but my <unk> because I raise all funding .
And I said to my son , " If you 've got money , we put your throat on the wall . "
In fact , we have <unk> and <unk> , and there are some beautiful things that you 're looking at .
<unk> .
I think it 's only the world that can save the <unk> of <unk> .
And we took a meeting in a room , and I came up with a piece of furniture from Japan , which made him 60 furniture for our buildings .
Because we 're starting to employ his own career .
And he did a lot of money for rich furniture now for a rich <unk> .
And in his <unk> , 60 percent of my <unk> are in my school , because I think it 's a good thing to do with my mother , the mother and her mother , and the mother and her mother , every day .
Because this is the first time you 've ever demonstrated what you 're going to do before you get to their <unk> and attitudes .
We even spent a lot of money in the hallway .
And that 's what they 're trying to figure out every day .
Now , I 've done a lot of talk about a little bit of high school administrators looking at me and see , and they say , " <unk> <unk> , your story is <unk> ; your school is good .
And especially those are the ones who are very , very curious about what we 're going to keep doing .
And I said , " Get a ticket , go to <unk> , put them up and bring them back and get back there . "
You do n't need a mission or a research group to your kids .
And what you need to know is that kids and adults are in their lives .
The cost of <unk> is <unk> , but what it does is it 's great .
In my school , full of sunlight and <unk> , we believe that the potential of love and human change .
It was at Christmas .
And the next thing you 'll see is a value station in the kitchen , and it 's based on a company called <unk> .
They 're doing well in tomato sauce .
I 've been familiar with this company because , of course , Dr. <unk> <unk> , unfortunately , he died of the plane -- hear I 'm going to build a <unk> wish , because I have to take a ride on the <unk> of <unk> .
So he asked me to go to his office -- it feels like I 'm going to see " <unk> <unk> , " John <unk> -- there 's only six billion dollars .
He said , " We 've heard you .
And you do what you want to do with kids and the Grand Canyon , and we want to build a wish for you .
If you have a cooking curriculum in your class , you give us a life . "
Because at the time , we 're just dealing with strategies of <unk> .
And he said , " That 's the way we 're going to do a lot of <unk> . "
I said , " <unk> , I 'm not familiar with the realm of the area that I do n't know , but I 'll assure you , if you invest in my school , then I will think about it , and I think you want to do it . "
And the governor was rejected , and he said , " Well , if I say I want to give you a <unk> .
And I said , " <unk> <unk> , let 's go to cooking . "
And John <unk> really did a million .
And the most important thing is he <unk> his company to my company .
We made a little bit of a American school , and that school was like cooking in the world . So , we designed a food commitment for the <unk> of the city , on the downtown town .
We did n't have a <unk> .
I want to show you some food that they 're doing in this country .
This is our dining restaurant .
This is <unk> Day . Why ?
And because students do these things , students are eating them every day .
But my idea is , I 'm going to employ the <unk> of food .
The food is not a rich man , every single person in the planet is supposed to eat , and everybody 's going to take anyone out of it .
So , in my school , we 've been sponsoring a <unk> plan , and these are the <unk> mothers who live in the middle , because we found that it has their stomachs , but they 're more <unk> .
Because I want them to understand , in this place where I call the center , every day of life is value .
We have black students here , and there are also white students who are sitting together that we 've found that <unk> can solve the world , because they 're willing to show a world of world - to - world behavior , because people are willing to show them to them .
This is a picture of a food mother who 's trained for six months after one six months .
There is no nonsense , no <unk> , without history .
And we found that poor problems are not the only problem they do , and it 's a problem .
This completely depends on how people think about people who are often decisions .
This photo is made of a food that 's been done for seven months , and she 's smart and younger . She 's our teacher .
I 've eaten seven layers of food , tasty meals .
All right . They do n't have feathers .
This is our dining restaurant .
It looks like an average school hospital in the United States .
I think the students should get this kind of respect .
We trained the creator of <unk> drugs for medical services , and we 're trained to employ some companies for some company , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> technology , a lot of oil .
And I promise you , if you come to my <unk> center , of course , you 're all going to show you that you 'll see a lot of money in the middle of the day , and they 're doing a <unk> computer computer . They 're doing 10 months .
There is no evidence that poor people are not able to learn the world of the world .
And we found that you have to give them a funeral , the sun and the food , and <unk> , that every time you can get treated with mental cancer .
We trained traveling tribes .
I could n't even read books .
And the kids in the <unk> , two years ago , had been a trained teacher , and he had now become a teacher .
Some kids have high school , but they do n't know about <unk> .
And you would have asked yourself a little bit about the <unk> of the 21st century , and we 're going to get them out of it .
And the reason is that the education system is <unk> from the government , and it 's not the population of <unk> .
These kids , as well as the wisdom of the ages , will be in my school .
There is no big deal .
That 's our library , and we have more <unk> furniture .
This is my art class in 1968 .
Remember , I 'm a growing - up guy in the ' 60s , and <unk> produced my life .
When I 'm ready to get my growth patterns , my theories that live in my place is , if you give them a Jeep , the sun and the sunlight and your passion , you can get them back to the normal life .
There are 400 <unk> of kids who come to me every day , and I 've got a art education .
These kids are full of <unk> .
And the people who last year I got these kids into university , and the average average rate has been about 15 years since 80 years .
We make a stunning discovery : the problem is n't that there 's no separation of love , sunlight , food , <unk> and <unk> .
So , for that discovery , I won a big and old <unk> -- the great education of the year .
I defeat all of the mentors that I think if you want kids to do it , their actions are more than normal .
Why do n't we do this in every single city , every city and every town ? I 'm really hard to understand .
Let me tell you what these people do .
We have the <unk> classes , <unk> , computers .
And those kids do n't have <unk> , there are no talent , no imagination , and we 've brought a lot of global artists around the world , <unk> and <unk> -- we found that kids can be able to become teaching people to be teaching them .
In fact , I came up with a liberal arts artist , and she was a African - American instrument , learning ancient <unk> art skills . Let me show you their work .
These kids have been rejected by the world , and this painting reveals their ability to love , when they have love and sunlight , food , good music and <unk> .
We teach the <unk> .
These are some of the students .
And the boy who shot this photo was demonstrated by the power of four years of <unk> .
This is our inheritance .
We have a world - class <unk> , because we believe that poor people need a global world , so I designed it .
We were preparing <unk> at the art of <unk> , and we had a <unk> plate . I did n't even have a solution to the parents .
And 15 years ago , I 'm going to spend a job and give a parents , so I 've got a lot of money from God .
And he pulled people from the <unk> to get them <unk> .
I said , " Bill , I want to hire you .
You have to start <unk> God 's thing , but it 's a passion for you .
I could n't get these parents to school . "
And he said , " I 'll let them go . "
And then he got rid of it , and he came up to the Jones and she said , " <unk> Lady , I know you want to join the art of your kids , but you might have <unk> .
So I 'm going to <unk> you . "
He came up with 10 parents , and then he came to 20 parents .
In our <unk> , we came up with 200 parents . One parents did n't go .
Because now , if you do n't have the exhibition for <unk> <unk> , you 're not going to accept social , because you think you are bad parents .
White parents and white parents are the same .
The mother 's going to come to their children and celebrate , anytime , anywhere .
I want you to look at this <unk> , because it ca n't be better than it .
And when I graduated from these kids , they had a four show on the universities , and they did have four exhibition .
And before you can change people 's behavior , you have to change their way .
That law is always very effective .
I was in this room , and I asked you to look at you .
It 's a new story .
We 've done this slide before TED conference .
I 've done a little slide on Silicon Valley , which is very good for me .
One of the women in the audience came to say , " This story is very good for me to leave me very deeply .
<unk> your computer is a little old . "
And I said , " Are you doing <unk> ? "
She said , " I work in Hewlett . "
I said , " Are you doing the computer industry ? Right ? "
She said , " Yes , sir . "
I said , " This is a very simple solution to this problem . "
I 'm very happy about what you announce , Hewlett - Packard and <unk> , as all of our technique and furniture on the U.S.
This is that room . Because our collaboration is only beginning to start .
And we 're going to show you a little bit about the global <unk> that we have in the world .
I have some slides , and stories start more interesting .
So I want you to hear me a few minutes later , and you 'll understand why he 's there , I 'm here .
In 1986 , I was building this center , and I wanted to be on top of it .
And one of the people who called <unk> is here , because he knows somebody there -- <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> afternoon , <unk> and I , I said , " Well , why do you want to get a black hole to show you what you 're going to do ? " Here is a park , and it does n't have a <unk> . "
And he said , " Because I heard you build this center , but I do n't believe you made it , so I want to see it .
Now I believe , and I 'm going to give you a gift . "
I said , " You 're my gift . "
He said , " No , sir , you 're the <unk> gift .
I 'm allowing you to give me a recording for my face , and I 'll give you my music rights to you , if you 're ready to have a license , you have to get a handle on the schools . "
And I heard the sounds of <unk> , six months later , when he died , he 's going to tell us what 's called <unk> <unk> .
And he came up , and he said , " <unk> in the country all around country . I want to help you . "
And then this is called <unk> <unk> .
And then one of the founders of <unk> is called <unk> , a guy named <unk> <unk> who 's called " <unk> " and a painter named Bob <unk> and an <unk> - <unk> guy , and <unk> 's <unk> -- and the <unk> singer , which <unk> the center of a <unk> .
And I 'm happy to tell you that , in these artists , I 've got 600 <unk> of music that the world 's greatest artist has died in my school , and he 's recorded his last <unk> .
Yves Williams found me , put him on my shoulder , and said , " That 's God <unk> .
It 's my music . "
We 're working together .
After the <unk> <unk> , the entire band was excited about school , and they <unk> the copyright rights to me .
And I made them painted , and then we won a thing called a <unk> .
I 'm really a <unk> , and I do n't have <unk> because I think we ca n't win .
But we did win our name in Madison , near Madison .
And lo and behold , the second shot of <unk> is that we 've captured music second for them .
And the result is that we become a young man in the United States , and it 's extremely glamorous in this epidemic .
This is a picture of <unk> Republican .
If you were there eating a bomb , and all of the <unk> were covered by you , because they were all there .
And my parents are in there , and they live enough to look at their children , looking at this building .
That 's <unk> , like I told you , he 's there .
That 's <unk> <unk> .
That 's <unk> <unk> and Jim <unk> , and they 're acting with us .
That 's our first <unk> , the past .
We just put it in the hallway and redesigned this room , and we filmed the first time for <unk> <unk> .
This is our new <unk> , all using video technology .
This room is a room that we presented for <unk> Richard , and she was filmed last year .
If any of you have seen it in Christmas , you 'll see that he 's going to be singing this segment of the show in the exhibition , and she 's singing the <unk> of his <unk> for our peers .
I can do it right now , and once you 're on the side of the <unk> , his CD can sell <unk> .
We 're playing fourth of the U.S. music in the United States .
I think we 're going to get better .
This is a picture of a building building in the <unk> -- on my school , so I did a <unk> box , and then I came up on the street and went back to the streets and came back and left .
This is the model of the new School , which is a high - tech greenhouse on the right , and the central state is medical building .
And I 'm happy to tell you that it 's already done .
This building is a very famous building in the <unk> , 20 dollars per year .
This is a bottle of water .
Every building has a water .
This is the big <unk> in the University of Medicine , and they rented half the space . We 're going to train them to train health care .
And the BBC was <unk> here .
And I love them , because they 're paid for <unk> .
And because of this relationship , I 'm a company <unk> , and this company bought <unk> drugs .
This is building .
<unk> four times the size of the photo , which is this year in April , and it 's what we 're going to spend on the downtown .
We 're going to make high school kids in the downtown corner .
We 're working with a large <unk> of <unk> shops in six states .
Our partners is a company called Ahmed <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> of California .
So , in Spain , <unk> and black <unk> came up in the <unk> of the downtown <unk> .
I told a American name , if he could help us find a little amount of money , and then we could put the <unk> on the left . He said , well , we do .
So we ended up spending the last summer , and we 're going to do it on the fall of this year .
So you 'll have to look at this -- this is the story of the story .
This photo is grown up after what I want to do .
And that brown building you see here , and I tell you , I 've made a big mistake .
I had the opportunity to bring the entire <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , which bought 1,000 feet -- 400 dollars per million dollars .
Do you know what happened when I finished the first <unk> ?
I 'm going to have this leopard <unk> in everybody 's imagination last year , and I 've got 800 dollars a year to buy the entire <unk> owner , who said , " <unk> <unk> , you should get a leader , because you have to get my <unk> to the point of <unk> .
Thank you very much . "
And this story tells us that they 're ready to be prepared for their dreams to make a real time .
And finally , look at this photo .
This is in San Francisco .
And the reason for that photo was , a few years ago , I wrote a slide in a big economy , and one of the people in the audience found me .
And he said , " That story really is great .
I want to do this . "
I said , " It 's a privilege to tell you what you 're doing . "
And he said , " I 've run a city , called San Francisco .
My name is <unk> Brown . "
And I 've got a little bit of a <unk> in my face .
And that week , I 'm going to go home and go back to the center of the night , and I 'm going to show him the first time in the center and meet him .
And he came to the center , and he said , " This is what 's happening ? "
And I said , " <unk> , they 're going to look like this .
And he said , " God forbid , I want to build a truck that is 25 years old , and now you 've done it .
And now I 'm going to move out . "
I said , " Well , what would you have to do ? "
And he said , " San San <unk> . "
I said , " Do you know the <unk> ? "
In fact , he did know the <unk> Brown . Yves Brown and I ate dinner with four years ago , and we started making the blueprint .
And the <unk> <unk> said , " I 'm going to make this school in my name , and I want to build it in the city .
And <unk> gave me five to five miles across the land , and we 've got to help , like a designer , a guy who 's <unk> , we have <unk> friends , the friends of the <unk> -- the friend of <unk> and <unk> .
And at the end of the Silicon Valley , I realized a person who was <unk> .
And after the lecture , he found me saying , " Your story is true .
I want to help you . "
I said , " Thank you very much .
What are you doing ? "
And he said , " <unk> a company , <unk> . "
I said , " Great . "
And so thank you very much , and you 're going to give me your business , and we can do it in the future . "
And I did n't know what the company was , but , <unk> , I asked a little bit of a school in school .
I said , " Hey , what do you do ? "
And he said , " <unk> is a Web company . "
And I said , " I 've got this company 's boss , and he 's giving me commercial business . "
And I said to him , " <unk> <unk> , I 'm going to tell you a little bit about me . "
And I went and became a friend of my friends , and he was organized , we 're going to start .
And then I went to the community community , and I said , " The community is <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , I say : " General <unk> me to work with you , that truck , if you do n't want to , we 're going to die .
The only thing for me to obtain is a slide slide . "
So , in a <unk> night , I stood up in 200 very <unk> , very frustrated that was bad at the house , and the temperature in the room had a hundred tons of temperature , which I started to show them .
You 've got 10 photos later .
I 'll tell you my story , and I said , " What do you think ? "
And at the end of the room , a woman standing up and said , " I 'm going to live in the place of God 's place for 35 years , and you 're only the only ones to look at us .
I ca n't wait . "
She affected all the audiences .
And I 'm going to ensure that we do n't just fix it and fix it .
I think we 're going to start building this year at the beginning of the year to build the model .
And I came up with <unk> <unk> , and I showed him <unk> slides .
<unk> said , " I want to help you .
We 're building a role in Los Angeles . "
And then he organized a bunch of people .
And then I went like a love of love and his music .
And I said , " Where do marketing come from ? "
And I said , " This is from your music .
When I was 16 years old , when I went to <unk> , the world was a dark , and she brought me back to the sun .
And I said , " Start with those music , I 'll be okay .
And if you do n't , how do I get done ? "
I want you all to understand : I think that the world is worth our lives .
I do believe you guys .
I do n't believe your hope , your dreams . I believe you 're passionate about your passion .
I was tired of like this : came to a city with the city , and people stood up on the street and the eyes were empty eyes .
Now , how do we become a nation ?
And in Pennsylvania , I had six dollars to spend six million dollars in prison .
But <unk> Miller spent four million dollars .
<unk> the medical community to get two million dollars to prison .
You do n't have the math ; you 've never seen it .
I 'm going to ask you to help , to give you a sense of <unk> , love , poetry , art and all these other religions .
I hope that every city , every town , is doing this business , and it gives you life .
I do n't think I did n't shoot .
And I think we can bring these things back to home , and I want to spend a lot of money around the country , spend less money .
I believe that we can transform people 's <unk> into a <unk> .
And this works .
You 're all going to do it like a railway station , and it 's always enough to make a lot of money , so that 's the easy fear of fear .
As long as I realized , I found a way to avoid this depression , which was in every town , so you would never feel lonely .
I hope , I 'll give you some friends here .
Thank you my story .

<unk> <unk> demonstrates a new idea of the <unk> of visual disorder for visually impaired people . Her approach is to bring the camera to the brain , and then it 's going to send signals to brain .
medical research , medicine , science , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : <unk> with prosthetic eyes
What I 've studied is how the brain is dealing with how it works , how brains get into the world and transform it into <unk> patterns , and how to use these patterns to control behavior -- to hear things .
I 'm a theory of a design scientist , but in the last year , I started changing the direction of the <unk> , and I just wanted to show you a example of prosthetic mechanical machinery .
This is the first time we did that .
It 's a <unk> - sighted device .
First of all , come from the blind .
Because the retina is injured .
And a lot of the people in the world have seen more or less , because the obesity epidemic or the <unk> are missing , and they do n't have it yet .
There are some treatments that are <unk> , but they 're very , very effective , and they 've got a lot of <unk> for most of the patients who are very interested in the <unk> .
The problem is that the cards are not very glamorous , and they 're still sharing visual levels of vision .
So for example , these devices are only helping patients to see the curvature of light and skeletal muscle , almost no other image , so they ca n't get the picture of normal visual effects .
And what I want to tell you today is that we 're working on a device that can change this device , which will be more effective , and I 'm going to show you a little bit about what it is to give you the work of the normal retina , so you can understand what 's going on .
This is a retina .
Now you can see a picture , a retina and a brain .
And when you look at things like this , the image of this baby 's face goes into your eye and leave your retina , and it stays in the front of the retina .
And the middle part of the retina is that it 's beginning to start doing this image , and it starts to use the image to operate , from images , to extract information into the code .
That code is from the form of the brain , and so therefore , it 's a code that 's going to convert the equations into the code , and I 'm talking about code code .
It 's like the <unk> of the baby 's face , so when the brain gets <unk> , it knows that this is a little baby face if it 's different , like a dog or a house .
This is what it means .
And of course , the climate change is always changing , so the <unk> models are constantly changing because the world is changing .
So this is a little bit more complex , and your eyes will send a different <unk> model to the brain .
If you have a retina chip , like <unk> , what happens if you 're going to die ? This cell is dead , and then all the cells and all those cells will die .
And the last side of the brain is the cells that are able to send signals to brain cells , but because these cells have no signals , they do n't have signals .
There 's no signal in the brain , and they do n't have visual information , so he 's lying .
A solution is to create a device to replicate the quality of the cell to the retina , so that they can re - start to work in the brain , and they 're able to send signals to the brain .
This is our research , which is what we engineered .
It 's made up of two components , which we call <unk> and sensors .
And as I mentioned earlier , <unk> <unk> made the function of <unk> cells -- <unk> images , turning it into the retina .
And then the sensors that make the tilt are <unk> into the brain , the retina is able to create a very regular retina chip .
So a completely blind retina , even without the fact that the cell does n't work , and they do n't have the same signal , and the brain can understand these signals .
There 's no other device to do .
And then I 'll just quickly tell you a little bit about it , because it 's really interesting , and it 's really interesting .
I do n't know what the cool word is .
And what it does is it uses a equation to replace the retina , and it 's the most important part of it , which we can bring into the chip , so that 's actually the math .
That means that we do n't really have a part of the retina .
It 's not saying we 've made a mini device to replace each other .
We just use principles of data to extract the structure of the retina .
And so these are the characteristics of the equations that are equivalent to the equation , which is like the effects of a <unk> electrical force .
And then I 'm going to show you a little bit about what we actually do .
This is the first three - meter model that comes from a normal animal , and it 's the bottom animal of a <unk> <unk> animal .
One of the most <unk> technologies that we 're going to find in the bottom here is the <unk> probe , but it does n't have us to do what we do with the ordinary things -- people , our babies , the baby seat , and the other kinds of things that they 're looking at .
And the first thing that 's going to be said is that each one of the cells represents a couple of cells , and a few slides later , every line is a different cell , I 'm doing a little bit smaller , so you can see more and smaller data .
And the model of <unk> <unk> is really good for the quality of the <unk> , and it 's not perfect , but it is good enough to use a regular <unk> animal .
The cells are actually <unk> , but it 's not exactly the same way that they 're normal , because they do n't have the right code .
How important is it important ?
What 's the big potential for the patient 's vision ?
I 'm going to show you a foundation that comes back to this problem , of course , if you have a lot of data , and if you have a lot of research , it 's called <unk> experimentation .
And we 're going to show you what it looks like at a moment .
Can we see what 's going to be seen from the three levels of the retina ?
We did this experiment with normal rhino / <unk> sensors .
So first of all , I 'm going to show you the end experiments of the general prosthetic .
You can see that the effects are limited because the <unk> model does n't have the right to code , so it 's very ugly , and you 'll see what 's going on here , but that 's what you 're looking at -- but they 're going back to the heart of the other -- and that is what it looks like when I start to say , " What 's the same thing ? "
So what do we do about the method of the code ? You can see that it 's a little bit better than you ca n't see the baby 's face and see what 's going on here , but it is a very challenging task .
On the left side , there 's the results of the <unk> , and on the right , the one on the right is an <unk> sensor and a <unk> sensor .
But the most important thing is that we can combine different sensors and <unk> together .
This is just the head that we try to try .
I want to say something about the common <unk> problem .
And it 's just the beginning of the building , because it makes a sense of a blind retina .
But that <unk> is the code , how to make the cells better , to respond to the normal , and that 's what we make .
Now I 'm going to conclude with that , as I said earlier , if you 're interested in this , I have a lot of data here , and I 've just said that this is a simple way of communicating with your language and the brain .
This is a movement for motion repair to <unk> the brain for a device , and we 're going to send it to the outside of the world , and we 're trying to send it into the brain and to understand it .
So what I want to do is to start with this method , which is widely used .
We use the technology of the retina code , and also also to study other areas , like the auditory system and the movement system , already solved hearing and the limbs .
And it turns out that it goes into the fabric of the retina chip , and we 're also able to zoom in in the structure of a chip chip that we can get rid of our neck , and we can get rid of the <unk> of the brain , or the areas that are going to get rid of reducing the damage that we 're inundated with in order to break away from stroke - to - face , <unk> - <unk> parts of your brain to stop passing from the stroke of stroke , right ?
And finally , I want to say that the code is very , very important , and if we can make code , the brain is the language of the brain .

<unk> <unk> found that the bacterium is dialogue , and they use a chemical language to do a lot of <unk> , which has a significant meaning for health .

<unk> : How do the bacteria communicate ?
<unk> is the oldest creature on Earth .
They have already been there for billions of years , and they have the cells .
These traits are only one cell , and they only have one DNA .
They 're only a small gene , and they call them the quality of their expression .
The way that the bacteria lives is to continue to <unk> nutrients from the environment to twice the size of the <unk> , and they 're falling down into two cells .
They kept growing , divided , grows , grow , <unk> , a little bit of life , but I want to tell you that you have amazing <unk> with these bacteria .
I know you think you 're human , and that 's probably how I see you .
And what 's shown here is a typical human representation of all the circles that all of his circles represent the cells .
Each human body is about <unk> by <unk> cells , and they allow us to do all sorts of things that we want to make , but you have a whole lifetime of bacterial cells on your body , in your body .
So there are bacterial cells who live in one person in a person .
So , we make DNA DNA , and this is all the A , T , G , which you call your gene code .
You have three <unk> of nature .
And the amount of genes around you are your own 100 times in your body , and they 're making important roles .
The most optimistic insight is that you 're just " 10 " , in fact , " 100 " is more precise , depending on where scale you tend to measure .
I know what you think is a human , but in my eye , you 're 90 percent of bacteria .
These bacteria are n't <unk> , and they 're incredibly important , they make us alive .
These are the invisible <unk> that we have in the world , and the harm of our health continue .
They <unk> food , they make <unk> , and they also remix your immune system to <unk> the production of the body .
They do n't work to help us , to maintain our lives , but never before .
But because of a lot of bad things that they 're doing at the same time , it 's always <unk> .
There are hundreds of bacteria on Earth on the planet , and they 're not supposed to come out of your body , but if you 've ever met it , then you 've got to do it .
So , the question that we 're working on is that the germs that you 're going to know about , and all of the things that you want to know are things that are good or bacterial things .
We 've asked a question : How do they do that ?
I mean , they 're so tiny , using the microscope to see one .
Their lives are like <unk> and <unk> , and so long has been considered <unk> of social <unk> .
So in us , they 're very , very small , if you do n't have anything to do with the environment .
So we 're talking about a particular way of looking at bacteria .
The answer to this problem is to come from a ocean called <unk> bacteria .
What you saw here is a member of a fellow of my lab in this slide , and it 's a segment of this bacteria that comes from the ocean , a beautiful , beautiful bacteria : " <unk> bacteria . "
And the properties of this bacteria are <unk> , and organisms like <unk> -- like fireflies .
We do n't do anything about these cells .
We just took the room , and we shot this photo , which we see here .
In fact , part of the thing we 're interested in is not bacterial , but it 's bacteria , when it 's <unk> .
And we found that when the bacterial independence is <unk> , they 're not <unk> .
But when they 're growing up to a certain amount of populations , all of the bacteria that are <unk> .
And so we thought , well , these are the ones who know how to be in the <unk> state , or in a crowd , and also together .
And then we found that the bacteria can talk to each other , and they use chemical languages .
Suppose that 's my bacteria .
And when it comes down , it does n't fall out of it .
But they 're going to create little <unk> , you can imagine that it 's a hormone , and the red triangles represent these little molecules when the bone is <unk> when it hits , so it does n't glow .
And as these bacterial bears are building these molecules together , these cells are increasing , and they increase the amount of molecules in the cells .
And when these molecules are <unk> , they 're going to tell you about bacteria , and how many neighbors there are , how much the germs , all the bacteria that are starting to vary .
<unk> is this way -- they 're interacting with these chemical languages .
That 's why the <unk> of the polar bear comes from biology .
Next , we 're going to look at one of the marine species : polar polar bear in this squid .
What you 're seeing here is the Hawaii glasses , which is its <unk> , and I want you to show you , that 's the <unk> of the two <unk> polar bear , where they live in this little amount of molecules , so they 're able to <unk> .
And the reason that this squid is to get rid of them because it requires these LED .
The foundation of this period is because this little squid life is living in Hawaii , roughly the surface of the junk .
This squid is <unk> , so they sleep on sand at the day , but they have to get a drink .
In a lot of <unk> waters , these lights are able to dive to the place where it is , because there 's only about two kilometers above the sea , and it 's only about <unk> .
This squid is <unk> a <unk> , and you can open up the <unk> of the bone and turn it down .
There are some <unk> on the back of this squid , and you can measure how many <unk> or <unk> have taken back behind it .
And then <unk> its metabolism , which makes light <unk> from its metabolic light of light , and it does n't have any light on the light back behind the window .
They use the light from the bacteria , and it 's <unk> light , like <unk> , which can not see its shadow , <unk> it and eat it .
It 's like the hidden culprits in the sea .
But if you look at it again , this squid will have a terrible problem because it 's growing up in its body , and the bacteria that are growing will continue to grow , death , catch it .
So when the sun comes up , it 's going to wake up in the sand every morning , and it has a lot of <unk> at the bottom of the day , when the sun rises at the end of the day , when the sun rises , and it 's going to get about 25,000 bacteria .
When the bacteria broke down , these little <unk> molecules disappear , so they 're not <unk> , but it does n't care , because it 's a <unk> .
And when the first day in the past , these bacteria are growing up , they released enough of these little molecules , and then they start swimming at night .
And we learned that these bacteria have this phenomenon , and then we use it to study the reality of this phenomena .
And we found this : This is my polar bear , and it has a protein -- this red square -- it 's a little <unk> that made it , which is the red <unk> .
When the cell grows , they all released this molecule into the environment , so there 's a lot of molecules in the system .
These cells , in the upper surface , have a receptor , it 's like <unk> with small molecules .
They 're more embedded in the surface of your body .
And when these molecules increase into larger scales , it means that the number of cells are rising to certain levels of hormones , which are starting to deliver these cells into the cells , and the message is going to tell those cells to start with light .
This discovery is interesting , because we 've found this phenomenon , not just in the sea of the ocean , <unk> bacteria , but all of bacteria have similar systems .
So we found that all of the bacteria could talk to each other .
They make chemical texts , and they can also discriminate that these words , then they 're acting only when all the cells get to success .
We took a <unk> name for this behavior called <unk> <unk> .
And it goes back to the <unk> , and then all the cells have to vote for the final vote .
One of the most important things about this talk is that we already know about bacteria .
One of the most concerned about that is that the <unk> of the bacteria .
It does n't mean that small bacteria came into your body , and immediately , it 's a huge amount of bacteria ; you 're a big , tiny bacteria you do n't have .
And we 've found that they 're starting to go into your body , waiting for you to start to replicate growth , and they are based on the number of robots to realize that the amount of power in their own powers , when you get enough cells , they get a huge host of <unk> attacks .
<unk> bacterial reactions are always <unk> to control it .
This is how they operate .
And we 're also working on these little molecules , and those are the ones that I 've seen on the last slide .
This is a little molecule of <unk> oil .
That 's what they talk about .
We started exploring other bacteria , and these are <unk> we 've found that small molecules are <unk> .
I hope you 've recognized that there are connections between these molecules .
Each of these bears is the same on the left .
It 's just a different difference in the <unk> of <unk> .
This discovery is evidence that the language of bacteria has a lot of <unk> .
And each molecule is just a little bit smaller than <unk> .
So these conversations are <unk> , secret .
This communication is just in the equivalent of <unk> communication .
Every bacteria using this particular molecule represents its language , allowing it to calculate the number of times .
Once we understand these , we start understanding that bacterial behavior is called " social behavior . "
But what we really think is , in most cases , bacterial bears are not alive , and they live in a place where hundreds of thousands of bacteria are in the area .
This slide here is a slide : This is your skin .
This is a photo , which is the lens of your skin .
Any place in your body , it looks like this . I hope you can see , there 's all sorts of different bacteria .
So we started thinking about , if this really is connected to bacteria , the number of bacteria that vary in the <unk> , it 's not enough to interact with bacteria .
They have to have some other way of seeing the other bacteria around it .
So the way we go back to puppet is to start exploring different bacteria . We 've now found that , in fact , bacteria can <unk> language .
They all have a particular kind of system , using special molecules to discriminate it .
But we found that they still have another system , which is a broad system .
So , they have other sorts of people who have the same thing , and the signal has its own receptor , which is bacterial language .
It 's made in all sorts of different bacteria , and it 's a language of <unk> communication .
The bacteria can be <unk> and <unk> the number of people around them .
They 're <unk> these things to the cells , and they 're trying to do what 's going to be in the whole community , who are in a group of groups .
And we 're using chemical methods for this broad molecule -- universal molecule , and I 'm a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a very small <unk> molecule .
And what 's important is that we found that every bacterium has exactly exactly the same kind of <unk> that can make the same molecule .
They 're used to use this molecule as a language to communicate .
This is the <unk> of bacterial infections .
Once we understand that , we know that bacteria can interact with each other .
But we 're starting to think about it , maybe we can use this to make something solid .
I 've told you that bacteria are social behaviors , and they use these molecules to communicate .
And of course , I also told you , one of the major things is they use <unk> senses .
What do we do ? Can we get these bacteria or <unk> ?
This <unk> is not a new antibiotics ?
And of course , you have heard , and you 've never seen a lot of antibiotics .
Now the bacteria that we have now , the incredible amount of <unk> , and this is because these antibiotics are killing bacteria .
And they 're either going to be the <unk> of bacteria , which is no longer bacterial replication .
When we did it with traditional antibiotics , we grew up with <unk> mutations .
So we have a global <unk> problem .
We think , if we can change these bacteria , it 's just allowing those bacteria to speak , and they ca n't move , they do n't know when they start harm .
This is what we 've done .
First , we <unk> the communication system .
We made a bunch of molecules to really look at molecules like molecular molecules , and you can see it .
So they 're going to <unk> these receptor , and <unk> the real molecules real .
And since the red system , we can create <unk> for <unk> , or for diseases .
We did exactly the same thing about the <unk> system .
We use that peculiar molecule to make some changes that we do , and they 're all connected to <unk> systems .
We want these molecules to be used for antibiotics , for all bacteria .
And finally , I just told you about strategy .
In this , we just use intimacy , but think about the same pattern .
You all know , when the bacteria came into the animal , it 's a mouse that does n't start to start beating <unk> mechanism .
And it goes into it , beginning to <unk> , and start <unk> it .
When the <unk> were enough , bone could recognize , and start trying to attack , then the mouse died .
What we do is we add in <unk> infections , and we 're looking at the substance of molecular <unk> , which looks like a matter of <unk> molecule , but it 's a little bit different .
And we 've found that if you compare the experimental animal nutrients , a bacterium bacteria , but at the same time , we 're reconnecting with <unk> molecules , animals that survive .
We think that this should be the next generation of antibiotics , which will enable us , at least in the beginning of the stages of <unk> bacteria .
And I want you to think that bacteria can talk to each other , they use chemical reactions as language , and they have very complex chemistry , we 're now just starting to start learning these statistics .
And of course , because these <unk> make bacteria seem like a lot of cells .
So , as the spirit of TED , they 're working with each other , because that 's what they do .
The bacteria , because there 's this collective behavior , so you can do something about it , if it 's never done .
And I want to persuade you that this is the origin of a lot of <unk> organisms .
The bacteria has been alive over billions of years on Earth .
We think that the organization of the bacteria produces the rules .
We think , by research bacteria , we 're going to be able to get more cells for the human body , and even further , even further .
We now know that the laws of the rules , if we can get rid of these <unk> , they have hope to be able to use other diseases and behavioral behavior .
I hope you 've learned that bacteria can differentiate you .
They use these two molecules , and they say " I am . "
And of course , this is what we do n't just just in the molecular level , but it 's just a little bit more than I think .
That 's exactly what you 're doing .
Your heart and kidney cells do n't interact with tissue every day , because you have a huge amount of <unk> in your body , and these molecules can distinguish different cells .
Again , we think that bacteria invented this mechanism , you 're just a little bit of <unk> and <unk> , but all of the concepts contain in this simple system .
And finally , just once again , the fact that this research uses that research is that we 've engineered these <unk> <unk> , and they 're also developed as a new generation of treatments .
And for all of the most important bacterium on Earth , we 've also created the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So , we 've made these systems , let 's do it better .
Remember in your body , more than your own cells , and they keep you healthy .
And we 're trying to connect with you with your symbiotic bacterial bacterial tissue , and make you healthier , let 's make it better . Let 's try to do things that we do n't want them to do . We do n't want them to do what we do .
And finally , I want you to show you that I 'm in <unk> , Princeton .
Every one of the things that I tell you about today is the photo of someone who 's done .
And I hope that when you learn things , it 's how nature works , and I just want to say , whenever you see something , you hear something about natural , fun things are made of young things .
Science is made by these eight people .
These two , 30 percent young young people are <unk> this country .
I 'm really fortunate to work with young people .
I 'm going to get older , but they 're <unk> , and it 's really a good job .
I 'm going to thank you for inviting .
It 's a very honor to participate in this conference .
Thank you .

The <unk> of democracy depended on civic arguments for the citizens , and unfortunately , in this extraordinarily interesting talk , audiences participate in the importance of <unk> <unk> , from interactivity and talk .
<unk> , law , philosophy , politics , productivity
<unk>
Michael <unk> : <unk> democracy .
Similarly , this world needs to be very , very important , and this country needs the same thing , which is the way that it needs a better way of dealing with political statements , which is a way to engage political arguments .
We need a <unk> of democracy , art art , and we need <unk> democracy .
We need a <unk> of democracy , art art , suggesting that most of the people who are talking about the debate , most are the ones in the television , and most of the people in the television show are based on different values .
I have a suggestion .
And you look at the focus of the <unk> of <unk> : I think it 's about the focal effects of finance , and you can see the attention of what 's going on in terms of institutions , about migration , <unk> , anti - <unk> .
Behind these questions behind these problems is that some of the problems that are strongly deeply deeply concerned about morality , there are <unk> problems associated with moral psychology , which is a lot of controversy about compassion , a few strong questions about moral , moral problems .
Unfortunately , in political missions , we have a few questions about the big problems of moral debate , which are very few of the problems that we 're talking about in the political debate -- and unfortunately , the great question of dealing with the politics is that it 's a very small problem to talk about morality .
So what I want to do today is talk to you about a discussion .
First of all , I want to say a Greek musician about justice and morality , and I wanted to quote out about an ancient poet who 's about <unk> and ethics , which I think is the way to look at the theory of <unk> , who are the ways of dealing with a Republican poet and the morality of the <unk> -- and we 're going to talk about a new way of thinking about the laws of fusion and moral issues , to see whether it 's the answer to what 's going on with the truth
I 'm going to start talking , ready ?
Aristotle <unk> : <unk> means to give people their prayers : justice means that they 're willing to give people what they are .
Okay , the end .
Okay , so you might say , well , this is <unk> .
But the question is , who should have got what 's going on , and why ? But what about the problem ? What is the truth ?
For example , suppose we 're going to extend <unk> .
For example , suppose we 're going to extend <unk> .
Who should get the best <unk> ?
And how do you say that ? How do you say ?
Who should get the best <unk> ?
They 're directly going to say that .
Audience : A <unk> people say a random sacrifice .
Or you have a <unk> .
Is there something else ?
Audience : " <unk> your best hand , " somebody said to the best hands . "
Somebody said to the worst .
How many of you think that should be the best for the best player ?
How many of you think that should be the best of your best hand ?
In fact , this is what Aristotle said .
In fact , this is what Aristotle said , but it 's more important .
How many people in your hands : Why do you think that the best hand - hand hand should get your best <unk> ? Raise your hand with the hands of the hand , and the people who are the ones who want to get their best hands on the top ? How do you think that 's the best player <unk> ?
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> biggest : Better <unk> has the best <unk> , we can hear our best music .
Social <unk> : Better <unk> has the best <unk> , we can hear the greatest quality of music , the biggest <unk> of the art : the Best <unk> , we can hear the best music .
You 're Peter ? Audience : Yeah , Peter . "
Okay , so that 's a good reason .
Okay , so that 's a good reason .
There 's good music to hear , our lives are better , we 're better .
But Peter , the reason for that , he 's very different from you , but the question of Peter <unk> is not different .
And of course , that does n't have a relationship .
It 's the best reason why you 're going to get to the Best <unk> , and she has another reason for why to <unk> the best <unk> , and she has another reason to ask the best question .
And he said , " That 's what the <unk> is , it 's been written by perfection , and he says , that 's the purpose of <unk> , which is the meaning of the perfect meaning , who said that there 's meaning in perfect , beautiful meaning .
And he said , for example , how to deal with <unk> , he says , in order to think about what 's going to be fair , we have to debate about this stuff or the purpose of meaning and meaning , and what we need to talk about is that we 've got to engage this thing or something , or a meaning of purpose and purpose , which we must learn about the things or meaning in the meaning or purpose .
And the natural purpose of <unk> is to make a good purpose to create beautiful musical purposes for creating a beautiful music .
And if we do that , it 's a happy result , and we 're going to be able to benefit with it if it 's a happy result .
But <unk> , Aristotle said , " But talk about the essence of what we have to think about , and what is the fundamental nature of the problem , which is that the values that we need to deal with , what matters are real , <unk> and normal , values , value , deserves .
<unk> best to the best <unk> , because one of the big reasons is that it 's going to be a best thing to get to your best pleasure , and that 's not only the purpose of <unk> -- not just for the audience , but it does n't just want to give audiences to audiences , it is n't only about advocating audiences ; they 're more respectful , more dignity , or <unk> musician , which is more than just advocating for audiences and believe that <unk> <unk> is not necessarily just about trying to accept the
And of course , the rise of iteration this could look very little , and it would seem very unlikely .
Let 's take a look at the debate about fair justice , and let 's see a debate about fair justice .
It 's about golf balls .
A few years ago , treaties Martin , <unk> , Nick Martin talks about him ?
He was a very nice <unk> , but he had a disability , and he was an extremely glamorous anesthesia ; he could have a disability .
And he has a bad question , and the problem with the air is that it 's hard to walk through the <unk> , when he goes down , and it 's very difficult to walk in the <unk> .
Not only that , but it 's too easy to injury .
And he asked the <unk> , and it 's a professional <unk> who asked him to <unk> his <unk> in his career , using a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And this request is <unk> .
And the reason is , " This is a little bit critical . "
Martin <unk> : In the case of the <unk> , the final vote of <unk> to Martin Lincoln , and the second thing to <unk> is that it 's not going to be <unk> in the way that you 're , in order to make a golf seat , Believe a <unk> for the law , which has to have a sense of understanding the laws of an <unk> laws that have to take care of what 's going on , but that <unk> must have an understanding of nature , who must be able to pay attention to the
Martin said , " As a good anesthesia , I want to join the game . "
Martin said , " As a good anesthesia , I want to join the game . "
" But I need a golf car to help me in the outside , " but I have to have a <unk> .
Suppose you assume that you 're in the <unk> <unk> .
Suppose you want to <unk> this case , assume you 're going to die .
How many of you think it 's going to be <unk> by <unk> Martin <unk> ? Anybody have a lot of people think that Jane - <unk> is <unk> by <unk> ?
How many people do n't agree with him ?
Okay , we 've got to do it with <unk> Martin , Martin Martin .
Okay , we 've got to do it with <unk> Martin , Martin Martin .
Please raise your hand .
<unk> : Yeah .
It does n't agree with <unk> Martin <unk> , who 's going to tell you why they 're not agreeing with the people who do n't accept the neutral person to publish the <unk> .
So hands on the hands of the <unk> .
Why is your reason ?
" Well , that would be <unk> of other people 's unseen , and he could have <unk> , so she could make an extraordinarily unfair advantage , it would make a <unk> advantage .
OK , I think most of the people who do n't agree with his golf , it 's a good thing to do , and I want to disagree with someone who 's going to use a golf car , which is a big point of thinking about his <unk> .
So , what would that be like for him ? So what about the people who prefer his son ?
What 's the reason for their <unk> ?
Okay .
" No ego . "
How do you call this ? "
We give <unk> a <unk> , and we can talk to the <unk> for <unk> .
Tell us , why do you say he should be allowed to use a golf car , and say , " Why do n't you tell me that he ought to be used by voting ?
" <unk> is n't a part of the game . "
But do n't you go from one person to another ?
" That 's not the opposite of the match . "
Is n't it a part of a chess game ?
<unk> : I 'm not doing it .
Okay , so that 's what you say .
Okay , so that 's what you say , who wants to respond to <unk> ?
Who wants to respond to <unk> ?
How do you say that ?
" <unk> <unk> is a very important part of the game , and it 's got to walk around on the sphere , " The ' ' <unk> " is really important .
It 's just a segment of the sphere , and it 's a segment of a game ? "
It 's a segment of the sphere , and it 's an excerpt of a game ? "
How do you call that ? "
How do you call that ? "
So , what do you say to that ?
<unk> : I kept my theory .


<unk> : " I 'm <unk> . "
<unk> : " I 'm <unk> . " Well , you can see , this is interesting , it 's fun .
In this case , <unk> <unk> led some <unk> of <unk> to this situation , which led to a couple of pounds of seals , and had a little bit of a <unk> in the case .
Is it about the components of the <unk> ?
They brought <unk> <unk> and Picasso <unk> .
And guess what they say ?
Yes , they assumed that .
And they say , in <unk> , it 's a very <unk> activity , and they 're saying that in the <unk> is a very <unk> event .
But this is the most important part of the <unk> .
So , let 's try to <unk> the nature of the <unk> to change this movement , so that gives you the essence of <unk> <unk> , and so therefore , it 's going to make the underlying nature of the <unk> .
And so the next thing that 's interesting to me is , well , I 'll tell you a little bit about the <unk> result .
<unk> : <unk> .
And guess what ?
<unk> agreed to Martin Armstrong 's plea , and he can use his house to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> won .
It 's a very interesting thing about what they 're talking about and what we 've talked about , about their <unk> and the discussion of what 's going to be fair , and it 's fair fairness / fairness and fair justice , which depends on the nature of the <unk> , what it thinks is that <unk> <unk> is the essence of <unk> .
And the problem with <unk> is that there 's a lot of <unk> <unk> , and that 's where it unfolds .
In most people , I 'm standing in most of the people who read it , and all of a sudden he 's going to tell you about the <unk> of <unk> , which is that it 's essentially a very small sphere of paper that goes from a black hole , so that this movement is essentially <unk> a small ball , it does n't matter whether it is a tiny ball , it does n't matter whether it comes from a black hole , right ?
There are two texts that are different , and one of those statements is <unk> , he does n't agree with <unk> .
One of them is <unk> , and he does n't agree with the reason he 's against <unk> .
Because he was against most of the people who associate it for most people , because he 's against a lot of people 's assumptions that he would agree with majority people .
And he said that the essence of the <unk> <unk> and the pattern of motion is a impossible impossible , and he says the nature of <unk> , the natural meaning of what 's going to be done , he 's talking about the nature of the <unk> <unk> .
His name was <unk> .
" <unk> things are essentially meaning in terms of what 's going to happen to the purpose of a goal , which is to say , " Well , what is natural is that it 's natural to make a purpose . "
But the nature of the <unk> Movement is <unk> , but it 's essentially the essence of <unk> <unk> -- but <unk> movement is the difference between the force of labor , and that 's the fundamentally important principle of making labor to work , so that it is a very important nature that is fundamentally defined by the characteristics of force , which is , without the purpose of what 's going on .
This is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> for Aristotle , and that 's what <unk> is about to ask about Aristotle .
And his argument is a little bit more <unk> , because there 's two things that he 's known for two reasons , because there 's two things .
First of all , there 's no really passionate commitment to this .
First of all , none of the people who are really passionate about this is that if we love the rules of what 's going on , it 's just <unk> <unk> , if you love what the <unk> rules are just like , and if what we 're love to do is not to appreciate the quality of our work , rather than <unk> the focus , instead of trying to enjoy the physical quality , not just to give us a better sense of quality and randomness , we ca n't care about the physical quality of our
Another one is another thing .
On the surface , it seems like a debate about anesthesia , which seems to be a debates about <unk> , arguing about the debate , discussing the discussion of <unk> .
But if it 's only about romantic <unk> , there will be a very clear solution , but if you 're threatened by the dangers of the threat , then you have a clear technique .
What is it ? "
It allows everybody to use a golf car , so they want to make a drop in their homes , as they wanted to use .
That 's the question of fairness / fairness .
But I think , if everybody is willing to take everybody , but if you give everybody to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , it might make a difference between <unk> and professionals , and that might be more headache , that maybe it 's going to make the wedding and the rest of the professional <unk> .
It 's not about meditation Martin .
Why is it that they 're going to use the essence of <unk> , not just the nature of the <unk> - <unk> mode , is that it 's not only the underlying reason to do it , but the reason for <unk> is not to be threatened by the natural causes of force , which is , " What is the problem with <unk> and quality ? What 's wrong with this problem : What <unk> ? "
So let me show you a little bit about the <unk> of <unk> , which is a bit of a kind of spiritual personality for <unk> accounting for golf accounting .
There 's a little spiritual personality for the golf department of golf , and they do n't have to travel , not to jump , but they 're not going to get rid of it , they have no access to <unk> , they do n't have to jump , they 're not going to jump .
After all , they did n't have to run up and do n't jump , not to skip <unk> , and they 're not going to stop there , so if the leopard becomes driving , then if golf becomes a dynamic movement , we 're really hard to give golf to the <unk> and the values of sports , the respect of the sports force , where we are very difficult to engage the high - <unk> values and our defenses and so forth .
The example is that , as far as the Grand Canyon of <unk> says , what is it that is fair to try to decide what fairness justice is , and what do we need to talk about ? What is the nature of the things that we 're talking about : what 's the essence of what the values and morality and the morality are the <unk> ?
A few years later , one example of the art of modern politics : <unk> marriage , a contemporary political tradition of marriage .
Some people have just supported with traditional marriages , some people who are only trained to join the tradition , get some of the traditional marriage , a few people involved with traditional marriages , some people who are still supporting marriages and people who are hungry for marriage balls .
How many of you have in one side of the room , how many people are there ?
How many of you have <unk> , marriages ?
So what do we do about the values of the marriage of marriage ? What 's the value of what we 're arguing about , what it 's about for marriage , and what 's wrong with our marriages ? And what does we think about Tony ? Well , how values are we doing about justice ?
The purpose of marriage marriage says that marriage <unk> is people who are desperate to fight marriage , who is saying , marriages are the values of meditation , marriage and <unk> , and values , values and commitment , <unk> and enhance the value of <unk> .
For someone who 's <unk> marriage said , <unk> is the only purpose of marriage , which is a marriage who says , " <unk> <unk> . " It 's not the marriage of marriages , and everybody 's forgotten , that 's marriage , <unk> ? That 's marriage .
You all forgot to have a look at the details , and you 've got the <unk> , you know ? That 's the marriage of marriage .
So , whether it 's <unk> , the <unk> of the church , at the same time , is a great deal of marriage marriage , which says , " Well , there 's a lot of advice .
If you do n't want to talk about social organizations , and value values , if you 're not going to discuss the values of social organization , it 's really hard to predict the value of society , but if not first of all , we 're talking about fair social rights and values that are very difficult for fairness / equity .
Now , let 's make these examples , and look at what we 're passionate about now , looking at this case , to see what inspired us to increase the US or the politics of the United States and the world 's political debates that help us improve the U.S. or world politics to help improve improve America or global politics .
Now there is this tendency , and if we take a moral moral problem , there 's this kind of tendency to think about the moral dangers of the political issues , which is , if you face political moral problems , it 's very easy to engage in terms of what 's going on in politics , so that if it comes to a politics of politics and each other , the idea of <unk> <unk> is really easy , to make a sense of view , <unk> and <unk> in other words .
So the best thing is to avoid these religious and moral aspects of the religion , so that 's the great question of deconstructing religion and morality , and so it 's going to prepare for the big questions that the truth is , so the best question is that the best line is to avoid the religious and the moral face of the religion .
And I think that what we 're talking about is the opposite of the fact that the truth of our discussion is that it 's a better way of trying to understand the moral problems of everyday life , which is really better , to engage in a good , respectful way to face everyday moral issues , rather than engage the underlying moral problem of what 's going on in the ethical world , is not asking people to think about morality , and the way they 're arguing about the political problem is to confront the morality of
In my opinion , this is a way of a new approach to democracy , and I think it 's an insult to a kind of <unk> art art , which is the way we 've got democracy art .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you so much .
Thank you .
Chris
Thank you , Chris .
Chris Anderson : From the way to <unk> , to marriage , this is the genius of <unk> ladies , ladies and gentlemen , which is a very powerful meme , and it 's a powerful combination of information .
You are one of the founders of education , and your <unk> is the first few big projects .
You are one of the founders of education , and your <unk> is the first few big projects .
What is your expectations about <unk> ?
<unk> : I think my plan is possible .
In the classroom , I asked students to have a lot of political ideas , and behind the moral moral idea , in the middle of the class , where I 'm going to ask students a little bit about political issues and their moral ideas -- and then they 've asked the students who are very politically politically creative and creative ideas in classrooms , but then there 's some major political themes and the morality of their students .
I think we can create a much broader public debate .
And my final dream is , <unk> us up with a series of dolls that come out of the Internet , and my ultimate dreams are , let 's put a bunch of <unk> on the Web , where I 'm going to show you a new set of articles in the web , which is a lot of non - <unk> - sharing , a college - to - peer peer to the world to watch free people to see free of money , to look at the whole world of free , for the rest of our world
CA : And then your prediction is , in a moment , Chris : So what is your projection for the future of China and in China , and you can tell people from China to China ?
Michael <unk> : Yeah , we 're going to talk to you today about <unk> in Long Beach and <unk> , which is right , and we are in the middle of the high - school community and the <unk> of a thousand students that we 've been working on with 1,000 students in high school .
If you think about the serious serious problem , exploration - changing ways , if you 're thinking about it , it 's a way to engage a lot of serious problems , and if we think of it .
And that 's exactly what I want to do with a virtual global classroom .
And so that 's what I want to do with a virtual international conference , and Chris , I think , is a lot of people who are willing to join the profession : I believe many people will join this business .
<unk> : Thank you very much .

At the University of Cambridge University , <unk> de <unk> argues that aging is just a disease -- a <unk> disease , which is the dominant disease of the <unk> <unk> , and the human population of <unk> is <unk> .
aging , biotech , disease , engineering , future , health care , science , technology , <unk>
94
<unk> de <unk> says that we can avoid early days .
18 minutes is a very tight driver , so I 'm going to start with the theme , and I 'll start a moment .
Okay , I want to talk about five different things .
One , I 'm going to talk about why <unk> is possible .
Two , I 'm going to talk about why we have to survive , and we 're talking about it , and we realize that we 're going to move forward .
And of course , three , I 'm going to talk about the past .
Four , I 'm going to talk about why we 've done this in the human race , thinking about <unk> .
And then , <unk> , I 'm going to talk to you about how we prove this [ <unk> ] and think about the <unk> of <unk> and thinking about it , and actually doing something wrong .
And I 'm going to use two steps to talk about two steps .
And the first step is how to rely on a relatively low - scale period of technology -- and I define it for 30 years of life , and in the middle of the age of 30 people , it 's been used until a really long time to be done .
That means , essentially , to take a lot of older older age , and the relationship between you in the next year or the disease .
The last thing [ <unk> ] , the second step , and what I 'm going to talk about is how to make <unk> , which allows us to expand 30 lives for each person .
Okay , so I 'm going to start with a lifetime of life .
Now , I want to ask a question .
Any one of the people in the audience is good for malaria ? Please .
Well , this is very simple .
Okay . OK . Now do n't you know that malaria is good or bad for the <unk> hands ?
All right . So we think that malaria is a bad thing .
This is a very good news , because I think this is the answer .
Now I want you to think about what we think malaria is , because malaria has common characteristics .
And that character is all <unk> people .
The only difference is that there are many more people who kill more than malaria .
Now , I love audiences , especially in the audience , compared to <unk> and hunting Beau salad , and the hunter is <unk> by the <unk> of the government .
I mean , I know <unk> compassion should be most anti - sponsors , but we know that a lot of people are not fully convinced .
I think it 's a nice thing to do .
You know , a lot of people say , " You 've got these people who live in cities and tell us what to do .
This is part of the most powerful way to live in the Arctic , and we should have the power to do it .
This is transforming the ecology of ecology , and it 's controlled by Doug Engelbart . "
But the authorities eventually ended up on the upper hand because most of the British public , which is a lot of people in Congress , and the conclusion is that it 's a non - cultural social event .
And I think the human race has these characteristics , and it 's a bad event .
What 's the hard thing to understand ?
It 's certainly not just life , of course , that it 's about the life of health , because whether they think that death is bad , the body has to be <unk> , and the human body is more <unk> .
So this is actually what I want to say about the [ human ] human species .
This is a global moment .
This is what people do with aging .
And I mean , well , I 'm not saying that <unk> is completely value .
There are also some good positive effects , like the ones that we need to think about , and we 're planning to do a lot of <unk> on the <unk> that we 're going to fight at the beginning of the day .
But if you really measure them , these <unk> are completely crazy .
You know , those [ of ] ] the [ unclear ] is really worth to focus on .
But the question is , do these <unk> are n't dangerous ? Is it possible to get older risks ?
Are these terrible risks that are bad at eight percent of the wealth of a day than the fate of <unk> per day ?
You know , if you did n't have a stronger argument , then you do n't waste my time . This is my [ unclear ] .
<unk> , a sense of thinking , is really powerful , and we 're here to talk about it .
People worry about the population , and they say , " Well , if we beat a long period of time , there 's no human death , or at least death / <unk> , it 's only about death .
So we do n't need a lot of kids , but kids are important for most people . "
That 's true .
You know , a lot of people try to figure out the McDonald 's , and give it the answer .
I do n't agree with those answers . I think they 're not .
I think this is true , and we 're going to face a lot of fuss about that .
We have to decide whether we have a low - <unk> ratio , or a high mortality rate .
He refused to do that for the long time , and death rates , death rate , <unk> -- and , of course , we have a lot of kids .
And I think that 's okay -- the next generation of humanity , right ?
And what 's wrong with it is that we do n't want to make this choice for the next generation .
If we do n't develop these -- we 're not going to invent these [ <unk> ] <unk> <unk> , and then we 'll have the age of our grandchildren who ca n't live forever forever ; because they 're young , because we have n't been able to raise these tools , but because of that , there 's no way of developing these <unk> .
That 's the response to the population .
So , the question is , why should we be in this one positive ?
The most fundamental answer is that [ the ] <unk> of the <unk> is inevitable .
It 's a very clever way to do it when you 're dealing with it .
It 's a scary day , but it 's inevitable , so we have to <unk> that idea from our minds to change what we want to do .
For example , human beings are going to come up with these ridiculous reasons to explain it .
Of course , these [ unclear ] causes two connections , two groups -- one day , <unk> .
And as soon as you do n't feel that part of our mind , we can begin to start doing something about the beginning of the day .
And the first time that <unk> <unk> is often <unk> people to solve the problem .
And this is why we have to continue and talk about this , and I 'll even say , well -- to give people the attention of the patient 's attention .
And I talked about this .
What I 'm going to talk about is three - year - old possibilities .
And that <unk> , I think , is that we think it 's inevitable , that you can use the definition that I 'm here to make .
This is a very simple definition .
It 's a very old side effect , which means that the side effects of the <unk> .
It 's not a glamorous statement , it 's a bad statement .
It 's basically a process of aging , and it 's happening in the <unk> of a car , even though our bodies have a lot of smart self - repair mechanisms , because these proteins are n't <unk> -- we 're still old .
Basically , <unk> , that 's -- in our bodies , all of us in the body are trying to keep the chemical processes that keep us alive every day .
These are the effects of these side effects , and ultimately , it becomes inevitable .
This is a nice definition . So , we can say that we could say we have a series of events .
And for most people , for <unk> , only two ways .
And this two ways is that the <unk> and the Grand Canyon .
And the <unk> doctor is going to work after one person at a time , and when it 's a little bit more <unk> , it does n't care about trying to take a long period of time and try to do it very quickly .
And , of course , this is a very short strategy , because it 's a <unk> that causes <unk> to death .
The way that <unk> <unk> looks more hopeful , because you also know that prevent <unk> are treated by healing .
But unfortunately , we 're very interested in understanding the <unk> .
In fact , our understanding of a little bit of loss of starvation -- even the cells , we 're not quite sure .
And even the <unk> of how the cells operate , like <unk> <unk> , in a few years ago , we found it .
Basically , if we 're going to talk about the amount of productivity in our lifetime , <unk> will be a good way , but it 's the <unk> [ [ ] ] <unk> , because we understand <unk> .
So what do you do ?
I mean , this is a good logical logic , is n't it ?
But it does n't work .
And in my telling you why not before , I 'm talking about the second stage .
And we think , if I say , we 're going to say that today -- there 's a lot of people who have been able to make it work now , assumed that the <unk> of the people , for 30 years of health .
I call this intense <unk> . Okay .
So , in fact , people who are very different from the age of the ages , or at the same time , when they do n't have a different approach , what do they live ?
And you might think that 's easy , but it 's not easy .
We ca n't just say , " Okay , if they do n't have to be young , they 're not going to get [ the ] <unk> of <unk> . "
That 's the wrong answer .
And why the wrong reason is that progress .
There are two types of treatments to be treated for us .
The first is radical progress , and then the second step is to keep progress and improving their efficient efficient improvement .
There 's a huge difference between the two of these two scientific advances .
We 're hard to predict how much it leads to a radical recession .
Human beings are very likely to think about flying in the sky for a few years , but a three - year - old realized how to fly .
But after that , the technology of the human fuselage becomes evolving .
I think this is a very <unk> technology that leads to motivation .
We can imagine every step of these technologies that we do n't see .
It 's much bigger than ever before .
In each science , you see these <unk> development development .
And in many technologies .
For example , the computer , as well as flight technology , is just a different amount of time .
You can also look at the <unk> technology , like health , diabetes , antibiotics have the same development .
So , I think there are two steps , which I call a stage , not completely .
In fact , it 's a young man who can benefit from these experiments , allowing people to increase their lives , even if these people are ongoing , when they 're going to try and cure people .
And most of them have been much more effective , and they 're going to keep them alive for 30 years or 50 years .
In other words , they <unk> <unk> speed .
<unk> change is more rapid accelerated than anonymous medicine .
This is a very important point to me .
Because , many of you heard me have a lot of people who live for a thousand or more years , and they 're all thinking , oh , we 're going to invent a few decades of therapy in this decade , research how to live in a decade or even more .
I 'm not saying that .
I mean , it 's just the progress of the <unk> , which is enough to make people continue to survive .
And these tools , I think , never could be perfect , but we 're going to do n't know how to deal with people who are dying of <unk> .
And then we 're not going to have three or four people who have n't been working on how to deal with three , four million people .
I call it a long period of long - term <unk> , and it 's a rapid fast development of <unk> .
This is a very easy name .
That 's what we expect in the rest of the world , in their health , to measure it , and it 's a little more <unk> .
If you 've got 100 years , or you 're 80 years old , the average average age is probably a bit harder to do what you do , because it 's a little bit better .
You ca n't avoid early days .
But if you look at it , you 're probably like , like the one who 's just going to get rid of the old age of age - to - age problems . You ca n't live in your body , some of your birthday , and your life is more young , as you die in the body .
And of course , if you do n't have a problem , you might never get a chance to die before you die , and it 's not going to produce a lot of disease .
So this is a real truth that I 've got , which is that the first [ [ ] ] " One [ " ] [ <unk> ] <unk> : We do n't know how old people are , because we 're not aware of the old number of people who are going to die .
But as soon as age , the first people that I call a thousand people in the world -- of course , to the global disaster -- in fact , it 's about a lifetime of young people who live at the age of age .
It 's really important to think about it .
OK , so I 'm going to leave you with this session , my seven - year - old presentation to talk about what the first time we 've ever got , and how do we get a long - term increase in life ?
And to do that , I need to say a little bit about the mouse .
I have a huge <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm not glamorous enough to suppose it 's a very strong <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
What is this ?
That 's where we 're going to take a long - term mouse , like average , for three or three people .
We 're completely missing them until they 're two years old .
And then we do a whole bunch of things that make them live for their lives , trying to make their average lifespan .
So , in other words , we started to <unk> these mice , and we 've got two years of life .
The next question is , what do we do when we talk about this ?
We can now tell you , as I 've explained , it 's a robust breed of Human <unk> , or long lifespans .
And the second thing is , how much do we get from the first half of the world ?
And thirdly , the question is , how many people want to avoid the old ones ? What do you do ?
My view is that the first question is , it 's a very difficult question , which is very difficult .
A person has to be very <unk> , and a lot of my colleagues would say , we should n't do this kind of thing , which we need to sleep , until we understand more .
And I think that 's a flavor .
<unk> , absolute is <unk> .
We need to predict the best of our best <unk> , so that people have a concept that can evaluate their <unk> .
So , I say , from the 15 years of <unk> technology , we have 50 percent of the opportunity to achieve huge amounts of human modification technologies , which is important .
<unk> : 15 years of <unk> technology .
And the way people think about it is that you 're okay .
Because people often underestimate the amount of scientific progress .
So they might think that just five years later .
They might be wrong , but it 's actually not important .
And then , of course , I think that the <unk> of the public , the main reason for aging to think about aging is that I 've talked about the world today .
This will be a historic moment because the public will not think that the human nature is inevitable because it 's very effective in the body .
So , what we 're going to see is that people will see a lot of variation in people , and that will be huge .
To tell you about how we get these mice , I 'm going to make a little bit of it for a long time .
And I 'm going to use it using " <unk> " by <unk> , and ultimately resulted in the <unk> .
Because the key thing is , although these are n't the end of the system , they 're going to make it inevitable , and they start to expand .
But these bumps are not part of the <unk> .
That 's good for us .
Because we can <unk> our original image .
And we can say that the difference between <unk> and <unk> is , in fact , try to suppress [ <unk> ] [ ] ] <unk> , trying to <unk> [ the ] side effects of <unk> [ <unk> ] <unk> .
I 'm going to tell you about what I call " <unk> " in biology .
<unk> , trying to stop [ the ] <unk> of the [ ] " ] [ " The consequences of <unk> " [ " The consequences of <unk> "
For example , death . This is a <unk> , because it 's broken only .
And if we look at this , there 's third ways .
We can call it the method method , and I call the engineering method in human technologies .
It does n't interfere with any [ [ ] ] the <unk> we have in the body .
It does n't interfere with that process .
That 's good , because it means that this is n't a <unk> , and it 's going to be able to do what we 're doing at the beginning of the world .
The project is just saying , " We 're going to fix all of these different types of different kinds -- they do n't have to <unk> -- but it 's <unk> , but the resources that make us continue to avoid death or disease . "
And we know that there is something that we do n't have when we 're in the middle of the age of our early days , even when it 's going to hit the age of age , even though it 's released from us .
Why do you say , [ <unk> method ] in the human race ? That 's basically why .
This is the key to the bottom .
If we 're trying to say that part of the <unk> is a very important effect on the process , then we might have to stay here for a night , because every single element of it is <unk> .
This list is just one example , which is no longer glamorous .
Same list on the right .
They 're just a little list of a age of age .
But it 's a whole list of the entire list , and all the side effects have been called <unk> called " <unk> , " and eventually resulted in <unk> <unk> .
And this list is only seven percent .
And of course , seven percent is , but seven percent .
The cells lose , the liver mutations are dopamine - <unk> .
First of all , I want to explain a little explanation about why I think this list is completely .
And of course , we can use biology .
Can you say , well , what do we do ?
We are doing things by cells and cells .
" <unk> can <unk> <unk> ?
And the answer is , <unk> molecules , because if a short lifespan is destroyed , it 's going to die after a long lifespan , like protein <unk> -- <unk> the damage of protein destruction .
So the place that <unk> <unk> must be really <unk> .
So , because of that reason , it 's a lot of <unk> , and this seven - year - old discussion begins for a long time long . This is really good news because , although we 're in this 20 years , the list is a very good sign because it shows that it has n't been increasing .
And this news is much better than you think , because we know how to solve all of these <unk> in the patient -- and I mean , what is the principle that we might be able to really do in 10 years , and we might be able to really do that for a decade .
Some of them are <unk> , especially in the top .
I 'm here . There is no time to explain , but my conclusion is , if we can get an enormous amount of money , we might have succeeded in the developing world , and we do need to think about it .
We need real trying to try .
<unk> biologists , you might have some problems , and I 'll answer you .
You might have a lot of <unk> for this session , but you have to read these [ of ] articles in the research magazine .
I 've written a lot of data about eight times , and I have these research dynamics for the beginning of the human race , which is a little bit more optimistic .
These are some of the challenges that make me <unk> , more confident , more confident .
And if you think I 'm wrong , I hope you can see the figures and researchers and explain why you feel wrong .
And the main thing is that you should n't believe that it 's a person who is <unk> , because in any area , if you have radical ideas , the dominant people have to have a little bit more <unk> and do n't seriously .
So , you have to be really ready for doing this .
And we ended up talking about <unk> .
And one thing that you 're going to hear is you 'll hear a guy in front of it , when he says he can memorize human genome . People are saying , " This is impossible . It 's not possible . "
But you know .
This happened .
We have different strategies -- <unk> consultants , this is basically a <unk> innovation , and you think it 's possible to grow life , if you do it .
There 's another project proposed for organizing a institution .
But this will be <unk> .
I mean , how much money do you see in Iraq ?
No longer . Okay .
And the best thing about these studies is that [ active charity ] " charity , " because the financial crisis is <unk> by <unk> , but I think it 's -- I asked these <unk> of life , and that 's basically 90 percent of the opportunities in the life of human life .
Because we already know what to do . I 'm going to say that .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Yeah . I do n't know if you have a problem , but I want to give them opportunities .
Audience : As you 're talking about aging , and try to manage it , why do you look like a man ?
<unk> : Because I 'm a man . I 've been 100 years old .
<unk> : The species on this planet have changed the immune system , to fight all sorts of diseases , allowing us to live enough age .
But , I know , all of the species evolved to be true to actually death , so when <unk> becomes very short , the world died , and the species die .
So why does evolution seem to look like " <unk> , " or the <unk> ?
<unk> : Okay . Thank you so much for a question that I can do with a controversial answer .
I 'm going to tell you the question of the mainstream mind , and I 've always agreed to agree with this answer . That is , no , it 's not an evolutionary consequence of evolution .
In other words , we 're going to get older because there 's no checklist ; it 's because you need more genetic methods , your genes need to become more complex , so your body needs to be a little bit more complicated , and you want the evolution of the problem .
So , to the evolution of evolution , it does n't care about the individuals , or in a long period of time , whether it 's all about <unk> , and that 's why different species of life have different lifespans , but this is why not the species .
Chris Anderson : These genes do n't care , but we care ?
<unk> : Yeah .
Audience : <unk> . I heard of the past 20 years of life in the last twenty years .
If I do n't have any accident , if I did n't do anything on my motorcycle , I would live .
That means that I 'm going to become you as a member of a thousand studies ?
<unk> : If you look at a little bit .
Your data is <unk> .
The standard number is that life has been growing up for two years .
So it 's not what you think or right .
But I decided , I 'm going to quickly developing it quickly for a year .
Audience : I 've been told , a lot of our adult brain cells , actually in astronomy , and in fact , the brain is alive .
If the truth , in the biology perspective , what affects the world ?
And if all of the cells in my body , I can live up to the <unk> , rather than two months of growing cells ?
<unk> : Of course , this is technology .
And basically what we need to do is to take a couple of cells from the brain , especially neurons , but we do n't want to get much faster than that , because the <unk> will reduce the functionality of cognitive functionality .
I just did n't have a <unk> species .
There are many species of species , like <unk> -- because they do n't have a nervous system -- there are no long - term cells who have long - term cells .

Thomas <unk> : How women have helped iPod Iceland
In the past , <unk> is <unk> , because there 's almost almost a couple of years ago , and I can basically stand up here in this country .
But in recent recent years , this is because of a couple of events .
First of all , all of us know our economy .
It 's very severe , even though some people put us into eBay .
And 99 percent of the time , it 's <unk> .
And then <unk> got out of the door , almost destroyed everybody and your friends , and even President Obama .
By the way , the name of the volcano read " <unk> <unk> . "
Your media is <unk> .
I 'm not here today to share these two events .
And I 'm here to talk about the story of the <unk> Foundation , and it 's a company that I hosted with <unk> . This is the beginning of our <unk> -- a year that is developed in 2007 .
Why are these two women who do n't make a <unk> company to build a firm company ?
In fact , it 's because we 've got the " <unk> <unk> . "
I 'm not saying that men are the majority of the ice crisis .
But I can tell you that the state of the country is like <unk> and <unk> , and the people who are in the face , the men are holding the whole problem . This kind of business is going to cause disastrous problems of catastrophic issues .
There are some people who are very upset about this , but it 's not something that we 're working on , rather than <unk> , and decided to build a <unk> company in the world .
This is in Iceland .
And until that moment , we 're <unk> as a member of the Palestinian percentile female .
And that feeling is like , from the bottom of the side , we 're the women , and we believe that the values that we do n't believe are more sustainable than men .
We 've got a bunch of people who are victims of the <unk> , and they 're all about visionary investors .
We 've completed the <unk> of Iceland , the most powerful times of the military epidemic , without any <unk> or clients .
And so I 'm going to thank you all of these people , of course , with the <unk> of the company and the timing , but we believe that our success depends on our values .
I 'll share with you these values .
We insisted .
What does that mean ?
We believe that people should be much more concerned about risk , we do n't have to invest .
That 's really good to understand .
But in 2007 , shortly in the <unk> of <unk> seals , the major effects of the economy , markets on the market are affecting the risks .
We believe that <unk> <unk> lie to the <unk> language , and tell people what to do , to come up with the bad news , for example , that we 're telling the people who are <unk> , as a result of a few months later .
Even though we work in the area of financial collapse , we 're dealing with emotions , but we value emotion .
We think <unk> and money are equally important .
Because , for all the money , they 're not working on <unk> .
And finally , we insist on management principle .
We care about it .
Even though we want to get more money for ourselves and our peril , we insist on the <unk> , but we do n't think that profit is not just the value , it 's more <unk> .
We 're more interested in investing in social engagement and environmental benefits .
And yet , we believe that these values are very important , but it 's not the whole thing about success .
There is one thing about opportunity .
Women grew up in the next few years to create the most glamorous investment on the future for decades .
And the growth of women does n't mean that women are women , in fact , the difference between women and women can be able to bring new values and skills to decision - making .
How much benefit ? You can make more <unk> decisions , and they can avoid <unk> .
But we 're afraid , well , since the ice is happening in Iceland -- the whole Europe is not very glamorous , so many people say , well , it 's faster .
Now , since we 've got because of the fact that , in fact , there are data on <unk> women who are able to ensure that they 're going to make decisions more , and what does business change ?
Will governments make change ?
I 'll tell you what it is .
Sometimes I believe it will change , and sometimes I have the problem .
We really want to make sure that failed effort is that you feel that you can feel it .
Einstein once said , " This is the definition of <unk> -- to bring the same thing over and over again , and every time you get a new result .
And I looked at the whole world , because I did n't have the same thing to do , and I 'd like to do the same thing .
I hope there are more <unk> ideas coming up .
Like TED , I believe people .
I know the consumer will become more <unk> , and they 're going to use <unk> to change the neutral and businesses .
And I prefer to change change , because I 'm <unk> .
We have a long history of women , and our women are <unk> , courageous , independent .
And I want to tell you , when I first realized women were important in terms of the economic and social society , that was my mom -- in August of September , 2008 .
The women in Iceland are all over the day .
Whether it 's a venture or a dropout , all the <unk> , the result is released .
They went into <unk> <unk> , fighting their rights .
Some people think it will be the orbit of the Earth .
And this is the beginning of my experience , but it 's a remarkable day .
Five years later , <unk> <unk> von <unk> elected Iceland -- she 's an <unk> woman , and she is a woman who has to have a <unk> , a woman who has to have eaten a <unk> .
At the time , one of the men who came up with a gentleman who worked with her pioneer , she said she could n't become president , because she was an women , but only half a woman .
And she was jumping in , she won her volunteers -- she made the chaos -- not because his <unk> was <unk> -- and she said , " Listen , I 'm not going to give it a country . "
And I can do this with women , and their influence , my influence .
But anyway , 10 to 15 years in my career , I do n't have the women .
When I work in the United States , I think everybody needs to be the same for their own power , and the opportunity for men are the same .
But that 's not what I 'm going to do .
We 're not different . It 's a good thing -- it 's because we can create life .
We should accept different aspects of each other .
And finally , I want to tell you that I 'm not dead in the way that you 're dead -- people are <unk> .
We should start to engage the balancing beauty .
We should do that <unk> and Congress , and we should think about how to make business work .
That 's how we change the world , and we can keep sustainability .
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> : <unk> Lincoln , and in 2007 , the <unk> of the New York conference has been arguing about for four days of aid and trade .
Africa , development , economics , entrepreneur , global issues , health care , investment , philanthropy , women
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : A talk to the aid
And I know that it 's very , very difficult -- especially in this conference , one of the founders of everybody participating in it .
So I think , maybe what we really need to do is remind us some things that are here , and maybe it 's going to require some ideas that we can take with the future .
That 's what it 's doing .
We came up here , and we wanted to talk about the next chapter : Africa .
But what we 're here to talk about is the next chapter : " Africa , " because we 've been looking at the past and focus on the past and now saying this is n't a good thing .
I showed you this image , this painting , about drought , death and disease , which we normally see .
And what we 'd like to see is that Africa , the next chapter , is , " Well , a healthy , <unk> , beautiful , beautiful Africa .
And I 'm sure that what we heard about is that the first thing we 've heard at the conference , I heard it 's important to hear how important this continent is , about how we get progress .
And this is important because we have a platform for work .
So I 'm not going to spend a time just to show you , <unk> your memory , tell you about the next chapter : " Africa , " because we do have a operating platform .
We really paste on it , as this continent comes out of a faster speed of progress .
Over the last few decades , we now have five percent of the <unk> , and this number is still increasing -- it 's going to depend on seven <unk> .
Meanwhile , <unk> is closed .
There 's a very long story about <unk> , because , I 've got one of the greatest practitioners of this continent , and it 's also a staggering decline in the continent today .
You know , as you can see , from about 500 million people to 120 billion people .
It 's a lot of work .
You know , we 've built the financial crisis , and why is it important ?
That 's because it <unk> our economy , our currency , and provides a platforms for people , building and <unk> platforms .
And we saw some of the evidence that we created different evidence .
I want to remind you that , I know you 've already seen this data , from 60 and six billion pounds .
In 2005 , <unk> -- for example , Nigeria -- you know , that 's <unk> / <unk> , but it 's really fast .
It also exists in other countries .
Why is this important ? Because it shows a sense of confidence .
The people in those countries are now confidence , and if you have all the money around the world , to take their money back to the end , it 's going to look at other people , to see the confidence for your countries .
Now you 're in the middle of the <unk> , not sterile .
Now , why are all of that important ? Can you develop so fast ?
And what 's important is that we build the platform , we have our own customers , <unk> , and other leaders , they say , " Look , you have to do something . "
Because we 're facing challenges .
The <unk> population is in 24 age .
What does that mean ?
That means that we have to focus on how we 're going to get out of the building .
You have to do something about how to make jobs that they do n't kill , and they can get a education .
But in order to make sure that most of them are going to work in their country , they create a kind of self - organizing environment that will make some magic happen .
You know , I 've been trying to <unk> in the last generation of government jobs , and one of the things that I 've done is that I 've done a research organization in Nigeria .
Most of us are n't even recognized .
Listen to the sounds of people .
So we ca n't see the needs of the people .
And I asked them , what 's the biggest demand for them .
And in other countries , this need has been the largest commitment to the biggest demand .
I want to start with you , I think , come back .
But before I tell you , I just want you to understand that .
I personally thought , the next step of building this platform is to let us move -- we ca n't ignore it .
It 's only five years , and we ca n't even talk about <unk> , because we 're still at age .
We do n't believe it .
There is no development of innovation .
Our reputation is still <unk> .
The <unk> of development and the foundation of the development has nothing to do .
So we do n't forget , building this framework and foundation need a lot of resources , including everything we try to do in Nigeria .
It creates our own project to solve , like <unk> , building institutions , stability .
We can build on this platform .
And this is also the debate that we 've been passionate about and private systems , aid and trade and so on .
Some of the people wake up -- the worst thing is that this argument becomes <unk> .
And this is n't what we 're arguing about .
We 've always been arguing about a wrong problem .
The real problem is what we need to fix , how we manage governments to invest in private components and values , people who live in their own lives .
How do we combine these things together ?
And to develop Africa , to do it , I have to say that -- let 's make a job .
There 's a lot of creative people around Africa , and you 've seen it here .
So I 'm worried about you in a controversial argument .
What do we need to do with all of that ? How do you get all these factors to get it ?
I want to talk to you .
For me , aid is -- I think Africa does n't always have to go to another extreme , and I 'm sorry to be sorry .
There 's been a national aid for Africa .
The <unk> was the one who said -- he dreamed of a day of Africa to protect kidnapping .
And then I said , " Well , it 's good . We 've got -- we 've been doing it already , right ?
The U.K. and the United States , if you do n't have Africa , is impossible to develop today .
All the resources from all of Africa are <unk> from Africa , and those resources have done today .
So when they come back to aid , we should n't have <unk> psychology .
The problem is n't that .
The problem is , how do we use them to give us resources .
How do we use these resources ?
Will it work directly ?
I want to tell you a little story .
Why do n't I get aid and not care , but whether it works to help protect aid .
In 1967 , Nigeria happened to be wars -- Nigeria , <unk> War .
I was 14 years old .
We have a lot of time to cook with my mother .
And for the military to eat -- my dad is doing <unk> in military -- <unk> <unk> .
We 're standing on the <unk> .
We just ate a little bit about where we 're going to get to the place .
In a moment , it was terrible .
We ate almost every day .
People are dead because they die .
I do believe you 'll remember the photos of those photos .
And there I am .
And in that time , my mother was rejected .
We want to die .
It does n't work with us .
He 's in the military .
So I 'm the biggest .
My sister had a malaria .
She was three years old , and she was 15 years old .
She was tired of <unk> -- we tried all the way .
It does n't look like anything .
And until we heard about 10 kilometers of a doctor , she can be able to raise the patient 's patient and give them a drug and offer them to drug drugs , and they 're doing it for the drug to make drugs for them . She 's going to get a medication and it gives them the opportunity to treat them , she 's able to heal their drug , so she can make them drug <unk> and sell them for their drugs and then she plays them with medication
So I was four days old -- very <unk> -- put her 10 miles behind the back .
It was very hot , and I was hungry .
I 'm scared , because I know her life is completely dependent on me .
We heard that a <unk> percent of the disease is <unk> .
And I was dyslexic , and I was dyslexic .
When I arrived , I saw a bunch of people around .
It 's about 1,000 people on the door .
And she came in in a church . How could I go into it ?
And I had to go around these people in those people , and my sister 's sister walked into the <unk> .
When everybody wants to think about it , I came from the window , and I jumped in church .
And I said , I 'm very soon .
When we jump out of the lobby , she almost barely <unk> .
She gave her <unk> <unk> , and what I knew was Roy -- and then I gave my sister a little bit -- this must be the result of the <unk> -- other medicine .
After about two hours , my sister started moving .
And they <unk> her , because she 's starting to wipe out the <unk> .
And then my sister wake up .
About six hours later , she said to go home .
And I took her on the back .
I went back to 10 miles back , and this is the nicest road I left .
I was very happy -- -- my sister was rejected .
Now , she 's 41 years old , and it 's three kids . She 's a doctor , a surgeon .
Why do I say this ? I 'm telling you because -- if you 're -- or your family -- you do n't care about where aid is -- aid ?
You do n't care about what it is .
You just want people to live .
Now I 'm going to make myself sad , and I think that saving lives in Africa is to have this effect , as you lose other people , like farmers , teachers or a mom or a mom .
And as a journalist , we can also see the story .
These people are the ratio of productivity .
So if we have <unk> people , if you save people who have malaria , these people are the foundation of the economy .
And as soon as someone said yesterday , they 're going to die , and they will die for the entire economy .
Even from economics , if we 're social and humanitarian , we have to go to save lives .
And that 's why one of the reasons I personally told us is that it 's going to get us out of what we 've got .
And then I also want to tell you a lot of people , including me .
That 's why I say this is a little bit more precise .
You know , we 're really good at doing these resources .
What does Europe do ?
All of you all know about Spanish -- the state of the European Europe -- from the other countries , are getting 100 billion <unk> ?
<unk> them in their hands -- Spanish ? No !
And the European Union managed to get 100 billion dollars . How did this work ?
Will you come to Spain recently ? There 's over the road .
That 's the infrastructure .
Because the support of the infrastructure , the entire continent , has developed a service economy .
Do you know that <unk> have a new amount of aid ?
<unk> is one of the leading countries in the Congo .
Many people , even other countries in the world , go to work .
So what do you do ?
And they use these <unk> <unk> , and this infrastructure is going to be able to participate in Ireland -- or now it 's possible to engage a lot of jobs .
They do n't , you know , we 're not going to take that money .
Now , in the <unk> of the Congo , the European Union .
And my surprise is that if they can build <unk> in Spain , the highway or other infrastructure , why do n't they use the same aid in our country ?
When we ask them , we tell them what we need , what I worry about is we have a lot of <unk> .
We talked about the World Wide World Bank , <unk> , <unk> and so on .
We have a lot of very rich civic citizens who are people in the audience .
One day , these organizations have a lot of money , and they 're going to be able to protect government assistance .
But I worried -- I 'm grateful for them to do what they do for Africa , but I do n't worry about it , because I see a new amount of aid entrepreneurs in Africa .
And they 're also trying to figure out what 's going on in the country to find what should be done .
But I do n't think they 're going to get out of the direction .
And many of them know about Africa .
They 're just trying to be found .
A lot of times I did n't see them at work .
They always laugh .
And a lot of times I think they 're not interested in curiosity .
And they 're going to show you what happens in the land , and make decisions .
Now , I 'm going to talk about romantic .
But I 'm anxious because this money is very important .
Now , what do they do ?
Are we still in the board when they make decisions ? Are you there ?
Do we have the wrong mistakes before ?
And our president and our leaders -- everyone 's talked about -- no , to say , " Look , your <unk> and your advertisers -- you have a lot of money , and we 're very grateful .
We sit down and down , and the amount of money should be done with these money . "
How do we do that ? The answer is n't .
Everybody 's doing their own effort .
There 's a billion <unk> to Africa , and we still have the same problem .
This is the scene of the struggle for the struggle for us .
We do n't have access to the people who say , " Sit . "
We do n't do that because we have a lot of <unk> .
We do n't have Bill Gates and Soros -- and other help people say , " Sit , sit , we will .
As a continent , this is what we need .
Here you have to make money . "
Not everybody is a entrepreneurs who can see what it is .
We do n't stop them . No , no ! But let them be more effective .
But let me feel like we did n't do that .
Over the last 10 years , we still have the same problems .
So the problem that we 're doing now is how do we respond to what we 're talking about .
How do we make government regard to the public and international tissue and the international system and our private systems .
And I 'm grateful for private units .
But it does n't work .
So maybe some thoughts will work .
They say this is about spreading and separate .
So why do n't we think about making money .
And why do n't we first have the people who help us say , not in infrastructure .
You 're developing the medical industry , if you do n't have infrastructure .
It 's much better if you build electric power and heat , and other things .
They 're also going to develop better , and if you have the <unk> can bring crops to market .
Do n't mean the infrastructure .
<unk> your resources to you .
So we can see that this is actually the <unk> of the private community , the international community and the Ministry of private private systems and people who are able to cooperate to collaborate together as an development .
That 's what aid is .
I believe that help can not solve our problems .
But it can be done . If we do n't do it , we will fail .
Why in China , one of the reasons is that there 's a reason -- there is a lot of reasons -- it 's not only about this , some people say you 're very stupid about the Chinese Chinese , which is <unk> for Africa .
And this is because of the Chinese .
If you tell them , " We need to be here . " They 'll get you <unk> .
There are tens of thousands of years .
In fact , the Chinese Prime Minister says that when I ask him , where is it wrong ?
And he says you just need two things .

You do n't plan . "
And I think the whole continent is supposed to be true .
The same thing is , we need infrastructure , infrastructure and planning .
So we can make <unk> <unk> to help us digitize .
Now I realized , I do n't say , medical and education , you can also invest in both sides .
But I do n't want to talk about it .
So let 's look at what the aid is , and it 's the partnerships .
This is an idea .
Secondly , they worry about a lot of risk in Africa .
Why do some of the risks that are not used to be able to use these people ?
But finally , because they 're standing -- I 've spent time on it .
Am I going ?
Okay , let me show you my <unk> .
One of the things that I think everybody is trying to unite is helping women .
There 's a lot of talk about this woman , and I do n't want to be there .
But some women are actually creating jobs .
As we know , research has demonstrated that when you bring resources to women , in fact , it 's a <unk> , the World Wide World Bank in 2000 , and in the U.S.
So what I want to say is that I 'm not saying that men are n't important , but if women leave the husband , what do they do ?
They go back to home , and they do n't appreciate what we 're going to do .
We do n't allow men because women are n't jobs , and women do n't dance .
But at least , we -- I think the idea is that men are <unk> -- not permission -- but they tend to get more help .
But I think you have to realize that resources are really useful in Africa .
Some women are creating jobs .
Yves <unk> created 200 jobs in Rwanda , in the <unk> of Rwanda .
In Nigeria , <unk> furniture -- chairs , chairs .
She 's building firms .
She needs another 2,000 money .
She creates 10 million dollars a year .
So the next question is , how do you combine the resources for those women who are capable of doing a lot of economic force , which are trying to increase the company and create more and more jobs .
In the end , you can also have a monopoly to work with governments , private systems and groups .
Thank you .
<unk>
<unk> and researchers , Charles <unk> , wanted to figure out how to work in the brain , and how he works music , so he 's putting his hands and <unk> with his team on the <unk> machine .
brain , creativity , entertainment , music , science , technology
<unk>
Charles <unk> : The <unk> of the brain
I 'm a surgical surgeon , and I 've never seen a patient who says , " I do n't want you to create the surgery . " So I think it 's a little irony .
I mean , I was doing so many surgeries to play with a instrument .
For me , the opposite of the sound of sound <unk> me to become a surgery doctor and research , especially music .
So I think that I 'm going to talk about how my career is looking at how the music works , and how it works .
Most of my work was done in <unk> , and some of them were taken in the National Science Foundation .
I 'm here to introduce you to three types of experimental experiments .
I 'll show you a clip .
This is a clip of <unk> Keith <unk> , and he 's famous for the famous <unk> singer , which is the most famous person who can be able to create a very nice <unk> in very intense , famous blogging .
And he can <unk> a music music that 's in his brain , and he 's not going to get the same way of playing the second thing . So , this is a very powerful one , I think it 's a good example .
Why do n't we stop this video ?
This is really amazing , wonderful <unk> .
I 'm a member of a <unk> audience , a fan , and I hear these feelings .
And I thought , how could this be ?
How can the brain get such a lot of information , and how much music is that so many music ?
So I came up with this idea , science , which was magic , but not magic . It was the brain .
Very few people who do n't feel art .
So in fact , <unk> is actually the product of nerves , and I started to start this research , like research methods .
I think I have some potential questions .
Can we study intellectual crisis ?
I think this is a good problem .
And I want to tell you most of the music that most music is very , very difficult to find music .
In fact , they 're completely completely <unk> completely silenced .
So the second question : Why do scientists study creativity ?
Maybe we 're not trying to solve this problem .
And it might be , but I 'm going to talk about a lot of what we 're talking about today , and we 've talked about how much about innovation -- and how we understand how to create a little bit of it .
So we 're going to be in the next 10 , 20 , 30 years , looking at a real scientific psychology that comes from the rise of evolution .
We have new tools that help us to come up with this process , a complex <unk> process of research , and instead of trying to analyze it .
So this is the brain .
All of us have a special brain , at least now , to understand it very limited .
I think the <unk> problem is much more than the answer , and I do n't have a lot of answers to you today .
This is basically what I did in the lab .
I 've done what the brain is doing to do this .
This is the main approach of my work , which is <unk> imaging .
If you have <unk> MRI , they 're exactly the same , but it 's a special infinite , so it does n't just give you a picture of your brain .
And the whole process is done .
This is called <unk> <unk> , which represents blood oxygen .
Now if you 're in an fMRI scanner , this is a molecular <unk> molecule with some of your special regions .
And when the brain disorder , it 's a brain region , and it swells up in the region .
The blood flow will cause the blood pressure in the region , and the amount of blood vessel changes the range .
And the <unk> scan can detect it , but you ca n't figure out how to capture it .
So using this approach to this kind of approach that we measure blood flow , not neural activity , we can say that the brain has a lot of blood vessel , which is very active , and that 's the key to the functional MRI .
This is used from the ' 90s , in the 90s .
Now I 'm going to show you one research about <unk> <unk> .
This is my colleague , <unk> Brown , with my colleagues in the National Health Foundation .
This is a video that we did if we did this experiment .
Charles <unk> : This is a skeleton of a plastic helmet , and we use it to do <unk> experiments .
It 's 35 years old , and it 's designed to be used in the scanner , which is safe to use it , but it will make a difference .
This is something that does n't work like this .
It <unk> the <unk> signals called the instrument of the instruments , and by the way , through this wire , it creates a lot like this a high piano .
<unk> : Okay , it works .
So , through the piano , we have a method for the music to study music .
So what do you have about this cool piano ?
You ca n't say , " Ooh , we have the keyboard . "
We have to come up with real solutions .
What do you do with the content at the bottom of the brain , and how do they respond to the <unk> of <unk> music ? How does brain work ?
I have a pattern here .
This is a trick model , it 's just going to work and remember the opposite .
And this is the <unk> of this statement , four notes , <unk> and <unk> , and it 's really exhilarating , but from the music .
This is the bottom line of <unk> .
We asked the <unk> of the state of health research , and we asked them to remember that the music on the left is you listening to this piece of music and then we let them use the same and <unk> .
And if you can put the button on the right , it 's a steering example .
It 's not the most natural environment , but they can play real music .
I 've heard about this 20 square meter .
And the musicians were really upset .
We first measure the number of music .
Are they playing a lot of notes in <unk> ?
That 's not the case .
And then we looked at the activity of the brain .
I 'm going to give you this thing together .
These are the ones that show you the brain , and you 're doing different kinds of different things when you do it .
One of the active regions on the left is the head of red , which is in the brain .
So we saw this <unk> cortex on one side , which is very high - scale .
We can see that the <unk> cortex is extremely low , and I 'm here to summarize you on here .
This is the actual region of the brain .
That 's not the <unk> of the brain .
There 's a lot of things that are involved in life , and they 're <unk> , they 're <unk> .
The conscious mind is actually in the brain .
But what we found is that these connections are in the area of self - control , and this represents the region where the <unk> <unk> interact .
So we thought , at least , it was just a research , and it could be the wrong thing , but it 's a study .
A big area opens up , and a big region is closed , so you 're going to feel wrong , not billions and billions of years to stop trying to figure out all the new options .
A lot of people know that music does n't always have a single activity , when it 's done by communication .
So the question here is : How do you play the brain with each other when the musician is playing music , and it 's a technique called Four swap therapy ?
This is <unk> <unk> .
And I put it into four <unk> , so you know how to switch .
We use the same way to put a piece of music to the scanner , and let him remember that this <unk> is going to be interacting with the other and vice versa .
This is that musician , Michael <unk> , the best <unk> of the world , a surprising piano hand .
And this is the painting that he 's going to see here in the face of a piece of music that 's much better than my music .
<unk> : Mikey , please .
E : You did n't have anything else in your pocket , Michael <unk> ?
Michael <unk> : No , I do n't have anything in my pocket .
<unk> : You 've got to do this experiment when you 're doing this experiment .
This is actually true .
Now we start interacting with each other .
And he 's there , and you can see his leg there .
And I 'm in control control , and we 're going to do it .
Michael <unk> : It 's a good statement to play .
And <unk> is n't very fast , that 's good .
And the reason we try and experiment with you is to give you a new context for the new environment .
And that <unk> , for me , gives me a little bit about my hand in the lower corner of the corner , and I ca n't stand up with the hands of my hands .
That 's really challenging .
But again , some of these moments , there are some moments that you 're going to have to feel very , very Zen - to - love with music .
<unk> : So I 'll look at this .
And you 've seen what you 're doing , and I 'm going to show you what 's going on .
This is just an experiment .
This is , actually , <unk> <unk> data .
So what do I show you here ?
And when he was playing with the four <unk> of <unk> , it was n't the memory , his language was bright , and his <unk> region was in front of his face .
In fact , his head is also equally glamorous .
This region is considered to think about the expression and communication .
Music is the idea of language , which is about <unk> , and we can see it through two musical skills .
We 've been able to experiment with eight kinds of experiments , and we collect all the data .
What do we think about <unk> and language ?
<unk> , of course , <unk> <unk> .
And I 've always been fascinated by that .
Let 's put a clip here .
<unk> - <unk> : ♫ Well , I 'm the <unk> skin , and I have five inches of <unk> -- nine times the end of the night -- and when I was in the middle of you , <unk> <unk> , for example , my whole relationship , the whole <unk> of a <unk> and a half - to - a - half , three - and - an - , - peer - wide , you know , it 's going to be <unk> for a 10-year - old <unk> in a 10 or 3 , which is
In fact , I think there are a lot of places that are in different ages .
In many ways , <unk> had a lot of social functions .
So what do we do with science ?
And I thought , I 'm crazy , but I think that 's possible .
This is what you 're going to do : you ask a free artist to remember that you write it for them , and they 've never seen it , they 're never telling them .
And I told me , I 'm going to tell you that I am in the TED conference , and they say , " No , no , you do n't really do it . "
And then I thought -- <unk> <unk> .
This is a screen that you can do with me , right ?
So what we did was we asked them to remember the sound on the left left .
This is the conditions of control . That 's what they remember .
Computer : ♫ ♫ memory , <unk> <unk> , " ♫ <unk> : Yeah , you know a repeat thing to do with a <unk> in a helmet , and I 'm going to tell you a little bit about the " <unk> " and the <unk> that I do n't know if I want to go through the face of <unk> and <unk> -- and that 's what I 've been talking about at the bottom of my head , so I have to be <unk> by <unk> ♫ " The <unk> ' ♫ ] I would love to
These are the great <unk> of <unk> <unk> that you give them , and they also <unk> .
They do n't know what you 're saying to them , but they 've heard it immediately .
Take the sound on the right .
We 'll give them all the words of those words , " No , no , <unk> . "
They do n't know what the next thing is .
<unk> : ♫ ♫ I 'm a bit of a <unk> person who 's called " <unk> <unk> , " in the <unk> of <unk> .
These are things that are very strong about this .
Whether you liked music .
It 's also about creative activities .
This little video shows us how we use glasses .
<unk> : We 're together with <unk> .
<unk> : From the way , that 's from the scanner .
<unk> : This is the video of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> remember a bottle .
<unk> : ♫ <unk> <unk> does n't need to repeat the <unk> of <unk> , ♫ ♫ Sobule : <unk> and <unk> made me perfect , when I <unk> it , I 'm just like , " Well , that 's the end of my head , and I do n't want to go through the way that you 're going to get rid of the water , because I 've got a <unk> in my <unk> . ♫ And I ca n't look at it .
This is actually the four <unk> brain record .
What do we see ? We see that language is very active , but when they take eye eyes , it 's not just memory , you see the vision of visual regions .
You see the old activity of <unk> motion .
If you compare it to the creative activities of the brain , the memory is doing more active activities at the same time .
And this is very <unk> research , but I think cool .
Well , there 's a lot of problems that we can do . As I say , we 're here , not answering problems .
But we want to understand what the truth is to create genius . I think , with these statements , we 're closer to it .
I hope that in the next 10 years , you 'll see really meaningful research , which is science , and maybe we can start to <unk> this goal from now .
Thank you so much for me , I 'm grateful .
<unk>
The people who often ask me , " Do I use calculus in real life ? " And for most of us , Benjamin <unk> said that this answer is no longer . He asks a suggestion , <unk> math and digital age .
economics , education , math , statistics
<unk>
Benjamin <unk> on the role of mathematics
Now , if President Obama invited me the next mathematical <unk> , I 'm going to ask him a suggestion about this country , and I think it 's a very good country .
It 's a very easy proposition that it 's not going to be too much .
Our math is based on a geometric <unk> .
All of the things that we 've learned are <unk> , and we 've got a theme for a subject .
The top of the pyramid is calculus .
And what I 'm trying to say is that I think this pyramid is an illusion that is wrong .
All the right ones -- all the students , the high school students know -- the <unk> : the probability and the statistical .
But , do n't blame me , Calculus , of course .
It 's one of the great teams of human thinking .
The laws are based on calculus .
And every study of mathematics , science , engineering and engineering students , were n't supposed to learn quantum psychology , as young as college .
But what I 'm going to tell you here is , as a math professor , very few people really use calculus , influence calculus .
On the other hand , the statistics -- you can , and should be used in everyday life , right ?
It 's risky . It 's reward ; it does n't work .
It 's understanding data about data .
I think if our students , if all of our teachers -- if each of the American people -- knowing the probability and the statistical , we 're not going to experience economic diseases today .
Not just -- thank you -- not only that ...
If it 's professor , it will have a lot of fun .
I mean , probability and statistics , the mathematical form of play and openness .
We use it to analyze the trends , using it .
So this world has changed from the beginning to the digital age .
Now this is the moment we have to change , from simulation to digital . From more <unk> , mathematical mathematical laws , math math , <unk> mathematical mathematics , data , the statistics of <unk> and the probability .
In fact , even beyond our students , I think more importantly , the more important thing is to make sure all of them know about two people , and I 'm serious .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
You can read the magic of user - <unk> computers , so that it 's just going to use a virtual object , and even the real electron objects , <unk> <unk> , reveal this <unk> .
brain , computers , design , entertainment , interface , mind , technology
<unk>
<unk> : You can read <unk> <unk> .
Now , the way we communicate with the machine is <unk> in a sense of consciousness and directly .
Whether it 's easy to open up the lights switch , or complexity , we have to give the machine a command or a series of instructions , to make the machinery for what we want to do .
And the people who are communicating with other people are more complex and interesting , because we 've got a lot of <unk> .
We look at the face , the body language , we can feel sensation and emotion .
These are actually the processes that we do .
Our vision is to introduce a new sphere of human interactions to interact with the human brain , so that the computers are not working on your command , and you 're able to respond to your face .
And if you want to do that , what you do is to understand the oxytocin of our brain , our control and experience .
Well , this is a very good idea , but this task , like <unk> , is not so simple , it 's two reasons : the first one , the <unk> algorithm .
Our brain is based on a billion active <unk> , which has 170 kilometers away .
When these <unk> interact , the power of <unk> <unk> is measurable .
The main functionality of our brain is the distribution of distribution in the brain , and it 's going to increase that area from the mind , which is that the brain is filled with <unk> .
The cortex folds up to the surface of the electromagnetic force .
Every single <unk> structure is a very different structure , like our <unk> .
Even if a signal might come from the end of the brain , it 's very different from this structure , which is really different , even as twins .
The signal on the surface does n't have a lot .
Our initial achievement is to create a kind of <unk> cortex , so we can be able to use a closer place to accept the signal .
The second challenge is to monitor the actual brain .
The <unk> are also a series of sensors that you see in the photo .
<unk> use <unk> or paste , and it 's usually going to be a process of a light - swimming process for <unk> .
It 's very glamorous and process .
This system costs million million dollars .
I want to talk about one of the speakers last year , and I 'm going to show you a little bit about <unk> , coming up here .
This device , as you can see , is a 14 channel , <unk> system .
No one does n't need any <unk> ; you do n't have to get <unk> or <unk> .
It takes a few minutes to take a good and stable signal .
This is also a Wi - Fi , so that can be <unk> .
And the <unk> system is much more powerful than this device .
<unk> the algorithm .
So the face of facial expression -- as I mentioned earlier -- is the unexpected of some <unk> <unk> .
But because of the time , I 'm going to introduce you to an cognitive system , which is what makes you move to move objects .
Now , Evan Grant is the first time to touch this system , so we 're going to create a new person .
He was obviously not <unk> -- so we picked the user .
Evan Grant . Try .
What we do is we start to train a signal .
It 's called <unk> , and it 's Evan .
He just relaxed .
This process is building a foundation or a regular model of his brain , because the brain is different .
This is probably eight seconds . All right now , we 're able to choose a movement that moves into motion .
So Evan Grant gives one object in his brain .
<unk> : Let 's make it " fashion . "
<unk> : Okay , let 's switch . "
Now the goal right now is to imagine that this object is going to go to the screen . At the same time what he does , it shows you a <unk> on the screen .
First of all , nothing . Because the system does n't know what he wants .
But this is the case for eight seconds .
So , one , two , three , start .
Okay .
Once we get to this , <unk> <unk> .
And now we look at openness to <unk> , and we can not imagine . "
Oh , good job .
Very amazing .
So we 've got a little bit of time , so we 're going to make it harder .
This is a bit more difficult because this is what it is to think about the world .
This is " disappear . "
So , what you 're going to do -- let 's try to make a movement , and we 've always done this in reality , so we can see this movement .
But , " No , no . So what you 're going to do is you want to think about it now , and you can imagine that the scar is <unk> .
Same thing . So , one , two , three , start .
Okay , let 's try it .
Oh , Jesus . He 's great .
We try it out .
<unk> : Yeah .
<unk> : But we can see that this is doable , even if you have a little bit of time on this .
As I said , it 's a hard process to imagine .
And the great thing about this is that we just give the system a little bit about what he thinks .
Because there 's a process of <unk> -- thank you .
Good job , done .
Thank you , <unk> , you 're the perfect definition of this technology .
So , as you 've seen earlier , this system is <unk> this software , even if you look at the system , or other users , they can be able to engage more <unk> , and they 're going to get a different approach in different ways .
And once you 're trained to figure out functional functionality , this function can be shared for any kind of helmet or installation .
So I want to show you some examples , because there 's a lot of real implications .
For example , in games and worlds , your face can be used to control virtual <unk> or characters .
Of course , you can experience magic magic and use your <unk> to control the world .
<unk> , with the light , the sound and the <unk> , will make the response for your emotions to improve your experience in reality .
Now , look at the design of the whole world of developers around the world , using robots , like -- for example -- in this case , in the case of <unk> , through a toy .
This technology can also be used in real life -- for example , smart families .
You know , by the way , through control of <unk> , or closed it down .
And of course , there 's a light or a boat or a <unk> .
And then the final thing is to change the life of life , such as control <unk> .
In this case , facial expression is used in control .
Guy : <unk> <unk> now .
Close to the left .
Now <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> : Thank you very much indeed -- thank you .
We 've only been reminded today about the fact that the potential of this system is , as a result of the group of users , developers and researchers around the world , we want you to help us to understand this technology . Thank you very much .
<unk>
Nathan Myhrvold and his team -- reminding us that we 're dealing with big problems like malaria , and as a result of invention , Nathan has shown that Nathan is <unk> new types of <unk> , which is shown by the <unk> of <unk> .
creativity , disease , innovation , insects , invention , poverty , technology
<unk>
Nathan Myhrvold : Could lasers kill malaria ?
We 're makers .
Our company invented new technologies , and they depend on other things .
We invent purpose .
The first is to fun . It 's an interesting thing . First of all .
And those are the ones who are intimately connected to each other , because it 's always going to happen if you do n't want to do it .
So most of the invention that we 're doing is <unk> and <unk> , and we also have some examples of services that are the best inventor of Congress , who asks them , " No way to solve the world . "
And Bill is one of the most smart ones that we have to work with , and he 's also working on this job and I 'm going to thank you very much .
Now I 'm going to show you a little bit about what we 're dealing with today and the problems that we 've been thinking about .
The vaccine is an important technology of public health , and it 's very , very exciting .
But a lot of vaccines are used in the developing world , because the vaccine needs <unk> .
Almost all the vaccines are protected by temperature .
If the temperature is n't low enough , the vaccine will not be <unk> , and if you do n't have stability , then children die .
The problem here is that it 's important to lose vaccine problems that children do n't do harm .
This is a way of <unk> vaccines . These are <unk> coat coat <unk> , and it 's wearing trucks or trucks .
We 've got another solution .
Now , a <unk> bubble can sustain four hours of cool than ice .
So we thought , well maybe that 's not good enough .
So we did this .
It 's going to be run in less energy , six months , absolute zero energy energy because it 's relatively low .
Now this is our <unk> product .
<unk> prototype is now at Uganda .
And we can think of this as the most important way to do this , in two days , with the beauty of the <unk> <unk> , and you can put it into a liquid cake .
They have magic effects , so we put some magic on it .
And the other thing is , that 's really interesting that you ca n't get to the bottle .
Because when you put your bottle down , you 're going to get out of your mouth , and you 're going to lose it into the bottle .
So from this point , it 's actually like a Coke <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> .
This is a simple idea that we want to change the way that vaccines are in Africa and the world of the world .
Let 's tell you about malaria .
<unk> is one of the major public health issues .
<unk> <unk> mentioned malaria .
There 's two billion people growing up every year .
Every seven seconds of kids died in the disease , and I have 27 people who die .
We 're in this country , and we 're not able to really understand what these numbers mean for adults .
The other thing that 's going to happen is that we will respond to the disaster , but malaria is a constant disaster .
So what can we do about this ?
And people have spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to figure out how to figure out malaria .
You can use <unk> , but that 's the question of <unk> .
You can try and manage patients and make them <unk> for disease disease .
And this really is really good , just in the poorest areas of malaria , usually in health care systems .
The vaccine rate is a very good thing , but it does n't get effective vaccines .
People are already trying to have a lot of <unk> vaccines .
<unk> is a disease that 's a very difficult epidemic to fight with .
You can be able to tag <unk> , if people use <unk> .
But people do n't use <unk> to fight malaria . People use it to fishing .
Not all of you have <unk> .
And <unk> , although it 's a way to prevent disease , they do n't make disease anymore .
So malaria is a very complex disease .
We can talk about it six hours to talk about this disease .
The <unk> of the brain has <unk> lifestyle , and they will mate . They 're going to get into your <unk> cell .
And malaria is a very complex disease , and this is one of the reasons why we 're interested in it , because there are lots of ways of getting rid of malaria .
One of the things that is going to be very quickly .
So we 'd like to be able to make all these kinds of sequences that are available for this year .
One of the things that can be <unk> for malaria is the same thing about diabetes to diabetes , and you take a drop of blood pressure in the machine .
But now you need to do a <unk> laboratory test a blank array of people who have trained to test .
You know , the other thing is that if you do n't need to paint it better .
If you look at your eye or see the blood vessels of the white eye , in fact , you can do this for a little bit of surgery , and it does n't need to get rid of any blood .
Because actually you can see blood blood pressure in your gut , and once you look at blood vessel , we think it can see malaria .
We can see it because this is called <unk> <unk> .
It 's made from <unk> . This is a very interesting portrait .
<unk> , if you 're a solid physicist , you feel fun .
We can do a lot of cool stuff with it .
This is our <unk> <unk> lab lab .
This can be a <unk> <unk> transmitter .
That 's very , very short time .
This is only a mere pulse of a <unk> <unk> , so it 's actually a continuum of photon photon , and it 's <unk> .
So it makes a very high - <unk> <unk> , which allows you to do all sorts of fun .
You can see the image of the blood . Now we can actually draw <unk> and <unk> in these blood vessels .
By using <unk> technology , we think we can make surgery .
We also have another cure for malaria , and one of the ways that we 're going to be able to figure out the way that it 's happening in <unk> , which is essentially the way it 's going to work with the blood system .
And so in doing something like this , the purpose is to reduce the number of people in blood vessel .
This is our <unk> <unk> .
We 're all software who are software , so almost any problem you 're asking , we all love trying to try and try to solve some software .
If you want to take off or reduce malaria , one of the problems is that you do n't know what to do .
Yeah , we talked about <unk> .
It takes money to pay for money .
Or you can use <unk> .
You can give them drugs .
There 's a whole range of ways . But it 's not different .
How do you know that ?
So , we made an <unk> pattern , the greatest malaria model , and we 're going to show you now .
We picked them up .
We collect every single <unk> , every village , almost every <unk> data .
We also collected all the data and the streams of ice .
This is a very important message , because <unk> and <unk> can tell you where the <unk> is <unk> .
That 's what it does .
And then the <unk> came to the table and building the patterns in the program .
And finally , the computer programs will give up .
This is the malaria epidemic in <unk> .
This is the end of the <unk> .
Let 's look at the <unk> .
The bears are almost naked . Because there 's no <unk> .
And of course , it 's all over the next year .
By doing that , we want to get rid of the <unk> or control of malaria , of course , in real real purposes , where we 're going to use software for thousands of times , and in order to <unk> the economy -- and the cost of social trade -- is that if you 're pre - <unk> , what if it happens ?
We try to study our enemies .
This is the bears on the lower speed .
And soon we 'll see air flow .
In here , we want to use the laser to make a little bit of particles and see the bears around the air air .
By studying bears , we want to be able to figure out the way to get rid of them .
Now , one way of trying to get rid of the body is to use <unk> .
This is a real advertising advertising .
This is one of the things that you ca n't do .
This is a basic technology , and actually , in fact , a lot of countries are killing malaria .
That 's exactly what the U.S. is doing .
In <unk> , 15 million dollars a year in the United States , but by using a lot of public health , it 's going to spread in the U.S.
So we 're trying to think about the <unk> of <unk> , which is that we 've made lots of malaria .
What do we do for the bears ?
So let 's try to kill them with a regular electric current .
Now this is a bit silly or silly , but there 's a little bit of fun in the device that can be done .
Your blue line has very cheap blue <unk> .
And you have a <unk> <unk> that can be able to control the laser with it very accurately . That 's why it 's here to talk about these little devices .
Of course , there 's <unk> and <unk> .
So what if we combine these things to <unk> the laser to the sky ?
Now , in our company , we call the " <unk> <unk> " moment .
How can we do that ?
Now , please take a quick break , and imagine what happens if we can do it .
Look , we can protect valuable values like Wikipedia .
The clinics are full of malaria .
They 're sick , so they get rid of the body .
You really want to protect them .
And of course , if you do that , you protect your yard .
Farmers can also protect them all the way to <unk> , because our photons is essentially organic .
They 're nature .
We can do it better .
If you 're really clever , you can get a <unk> laser for this <unk> sensor , and you could <unk> it .
And then you decide that this is a <unk> I 'm going to kill or do n't want to kill ?
And Moore 's Law is using the price of the computer , and we can measure the weight of our computers , to measure weight , so whether it 's going to make the button .
In fact , we need to kill female bears .
They 're only dangerous .
They 're only holding milk .
In fact , they have to survive -- they 're going to depend on antibiotics every day , actually , in the laboratory , to feed them , but women need dogs .
How do you feel crazy , right ?
Do you want to see it ?
Audience : Yeah .
Okay , so that 's what we 're trying to do for the law . That 's this .
And then , as soon as it came to mind , we thought , well , maybe it 's a very simple thing to do .
So , <unk> <unk> , he did this device in fact , and there was a lot of <unk> in the <unk> .
We 're here .
We 're going to show you . We do n't have to kill the laser , it 's a short <unk> , but it is a little bit of a <unk> penguin , and you ca n't get a long period of time .
Get it out . Put it on .
<unk> : We can now see a box on the other side .
We also see the fact that the limb is flying inside the <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> , if he had a little bit of <unk> around us , we could see the bears everywhere .
Next is a very direct <unk> process , and let me tell you how to operate .
And you can see that these seals are tracked around the river , and this is really interesting .
And then we can actually <unk> them with laser laser .
Now what we 're going to do is we use low power laser laser to actually measure the functionality of wing .
So you might hear some bears around .
Nathan Myhrvold : You 're listening to the bears .
<unk> : So we 'll see it .
And because of the laser , you can see bears around the river .
It 's slow to get the opportunity to see what happens .
This is the effect of the speed of high - speed <unk> .
This is the demonstration of the design system that we 've designed for TED , which is to be able to develop this kind of system , and we 're trying to reduce it in a very difficult way to use the cost of control in Africa and in other countries .
Nathan Myhrvold : If you show you what we 're doing with laser glasses , what 's going on here is that it 's all interesting .
And it makes people feel very <unk> .
This is one of the founders of <unk> we make .
There is a little bit of energy here .
And we 're going to zoom in and see the other .
This is the other . <unk> .
And what 's interesting is that we 're always killing them , they 're not going to get rid of the fall .
<unk> motivation is very glamorous .
I mean , we can <unk> the wing , but it 's still going to slow down .
That 's where I 'm going to show you . Thank you very much .
<unk>
If you have a lot of food in the kitchen , you 've seen many of the food , water and energy that are wasted , <unk> <unk> shares his personal vision -- lots of miles per gallon , and <unk> the resources to the temple , the <unk> and its <unk> , to keep the separation of <unk> .
business , culture , entertainment , food , global issues , sustainability
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : <unk> of sustainability
The <unk> restaurants are roughly the most <unk> industrial industry in the world .
Now , every single one of the food that we consume in the U.K. is the <unk> heat heat to produce .
A lot of things .
I want to talk about some more profound action .
This is what I found today in free , if anyone who wants to go home , get home .
It 's just a symptom , and I spent a long time -- 25 years -- that 's the truth .
In its life , about eight different forms of forms .
First of all , we 're going to have a lot of energy .
The potatoes will grow , and it 's going to absorb it .
We can <unk> .
Next is a lot of problems with <unk> .
And then I went to the clinic and went to my hands .
I 'm ready to be cooking , and I 'm going to love you all .
And the final stage is <unk> , which is the most <unk> stage .
They 're wasted into a couple of forms .
Somebody is wasted , someone waste space , somebody waste energy , people waste waste .
I 've been working in most of the last five years of work in the past five years .
So , what would you like to focus on ?
This is actually a lot different than anything .
It 's a restaurant that 's called " <unk> . "
<unk> and <unk> the photos .
I 'm going to show you a couple of points .
<unk> : <unk> , wake up .
<unk> : Keep made , recycle it .
<unk> : <unk> building .
This is produced by the outside of the <unk> Bay Area .
This <unk> , though , is very uncomfortable , she does n't like sitting in front of the car , but she went to the local <unk> singer , and she bought some stores , all <unk> and <unk> .
I hate waste , especially walls .
And if you do n't do it , I 'm going to do that , and I 'll show you what I do .
<unk> restaurants are using renewable energy .
It 's all about the <unk> of the winds , the light in the wind .
It 's a very important brands that uses <unk> <unk> , which is important for people who work in restaurants .
I 've been trying to figure out this , and I do n't know whether you remember , but I have a lot of <unk> .
That 's <unk> <unk> .
I 've always been thinking about it .
But I 'd like to do experiments with <unk> , experimentally .
And that will be more than my long life ?
This is a <unk> <unk> .
It looks good than a new new thing .
It 's important to recycle resources .
We 're also collecting water .
Put water inside of the bottle , put it in the <unk> , and <unk> the same bottle .
Here 's another great example of this .
If you look at the tree tree , it 's actually covered in a <unk> , and we 're going to zoom in with the leopard <unk> .
And I 've got a little portrait of the <unk> tree , and I grew up with <unk> <unk> .
This is the kitchen , it 's in the same room .
I 've designed the carrot , and it allows people to stop food , so that you can do it again .
Not every time I did the same <unk> , I decided to decide how much <unk> they would eat .
Okay , the kitchen is no big , about five <unk> .
But one day they can supply <unk> people .
We create a lot of waste every day .
It 's a waste on it .
They ca n't create waste .
But I 'm not going to say that not to kill waste , but the production of waste .
I 'm going to have no resources , but it 's all I do . That 's my job .
And I put the <unk> food into the wound , and then I 'm going to get rid of the wing , I can start to store it .
I was making CDs in the yard .
All of the soil you see in the yard , actually , is food , which is the rain junk , and I put it into my <unk> and <unk> that made these tubes and the <unk> .
Three of the founders of <unk> -- the last week you 've got about 70 <unk> of vegetables , really , great , wonderful actors .
There 's a lot of <unk> in it .
One of them is really a big <unk> .
And I took some glasses and I got a bunch of glasses , and she said , " Give you dinner . "
It could be dry vegetables , and then ...
I do n't know how many glasses there are , but I think I 'll have a big <unk> .
What you see here is the <unk> system .
From here , it goes out of the restaurant , and it 's going to collect this rock , which is a little bit of a rock and I 'm able to use a filter for anyone else .
I 'd like to go further and get rid of those water , and maybe I do n't know .
It 's a very important combination .
I studied a restaurant called " <unk> . "
If I could make a restaurant that did n't have a carbon - growing restaurant , it would be a good thing to do .
I must do it .
This is a restaurant that looks like <unk> , the same <unk> .
Everything is built , and it 's very glamorous .
But this is <unk> restaurants .
It 's all about the power and the kitchen and the kitchen .
It 's all <unk> , so I 've had the wind and the <unk> .
You 've got to know a little bit about it , and it 's very important that this room is filled with heat , but you 're swimming by the <unk> <unk> , to collect <unk> .
Yves bears are <unk> .
The <unk> system , I do n't have air conditioning , because I think it 's energy .
So it 's a very simple application .
And I 'm going to launch it out of the temperature of temperature , using heat mechanisms , to <unk> it , on the roof , with the <unk> sail , and the wind is slowed down at the restaurant , trying to get them to feel <unk> , or <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> of England , and it 's slow to rotate and flows through the rooms .
Very advanced , completely <unk> air -- I love this stuff .
There was a river outside the restaurant , and we rented the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the temperature of the ice and the interior temperature , about four degrees centigrade .
I do n't know how to do that , but I spent a lot of money .
Best of all , there 's a cook in the restaurant , and it 's going to depend on the boat , completely <unk> , but the power force , the creator .
He 's got the fruit that they need to be .
The name of this restaurant is meaningful .
And the theme of <unk> is the <unk> , the subject of the water , and I think , I want to have a restaurant that 's going to be a Chinese restaurant for China .
I 've got water and glue , and I have a fire restaurant .
And there 's also the cover of <unk> and <unk> .
Do you see you .
Okay , that 's my next <unk> .
I think five weeks . It 's my psychoanalyst , really bad .
I 'm going to take an <unk> <unk> .
Basically , restaurants are only leading to me with the clientele .
But I want to make my food <unk> more .
My goal is to <unk> the <unk> , or the people who believed that .
This is a social company , no <unk> malls .
We 're going to connect with the social community of food and <unk> community , and the relationship between community and Europe , we 're trying to <unk> London with farmers and farmers .
That 's really important .
I 'm going to sell the muscle , I 'll sell milk , and I would sell <unk> and <unk> -- everything is important .
I 've been doing it now , and I 'm going to put it on floor , preparing a box box , ready to get some <unk> and recycle it .
It 's all about <unk> .
In fact , I want to put this shopping <unk> in the world .
There was no food wasted .
Nobody did .
In fact , if you look at it , it 's only about <unk> <unk> .
I 'll do more than they did .
Nature does n't have a waste of waste , and it does n't happen .
All the nature of the natural world is moving through a closed cycle , where it 's going to be the beginning , and the first day we can benefit from these waste , which we have to understand .
If we do n't think we 're going to do a change for the world , if we will not think about what food is , we have a day to kill it .
I 'm going to give you a little bit of responsibility for you , and we 're going to get some responsibility .
The business of eco - awareness is practical .
This company is alive , and I 've got a company that 's going to happen .
This is the map of the beginning .
I think this is important .
We 're going to be able to do that , <unk> and <unk> , waste - on - demand , all over the bottom of this slide , spreading to the final point that I want to emphasize , and then there are four key points that we 're arguing about .
It 's not perfect , they represent my idea .
I think we 're going to meet a lot of problems , but you have to be able to find a lot of <unk> .
I want you all to work .
Thank you .
<unk>
Your life has been a great and happy moment , and how you 're going to release these moments of moments in this moment ?
art , film , life , memory , video
<unk>
<unk> : One day .
I 'm a artist .
I lived in New York , and I was doing a lot of <unk> from my graduate student , from graduate , eight and eight , so it was a little bit tired .
I 've got a lot of night in the offices , and I 've found that there 's no amount of personal projects that I do n't want to do .
And when I was working at work , I saw <unk> in the TED conference , " Time time . "
" I need time traveling , and family , " and " start <unk> the idea of creativity . "
My project in my project is called " One Laptop per Child . "
And the idea is that I 'm fighting a couple of weeks every day , and the next day you 've got to get a copy of the video that 's going to be a segment of the video that I 'm not able to show my life , until I had no ability to release these videos .
The purpose of the project is , first , I do n't like to forget what to do .
There 's a lot of things I 've ever done before , and I ca n't get out of it until someone said , " Yeah , I 'm doing this . "
At the beginning of this project , I found out that if you 're not very interesting about what 's going to be done today , I might forget about documenting videos .
So a day , when I forget the <unk> video , I really do n't want to go to my own life , and I 'd like to do it for the last 30 years to get rid of that project , but I realized that a few weeks later , my brain would n't forget that the brain was n't forgotten .
So if I have to live 80 , my video can reach five hours per hour , <unk> me 50 years of life .
When I went to 40 , it was a 18 hours from my first 30 years .
And this project <unk> me every day trying to think about what the interesting thing to do today .
Now , one of the problems that I 'm going to do is , as a matter of time , a month of a day , it seems a little bit more <unk> about the <unk> , which is that you know , I do n't like it , and you can see the way that it is to be recall .
This project is a project that allows me to be able to <unk> my entire life .
Even if it 's just a second clip , it allows me to be <unk> .
Sometimes you have to choose a second one day .
And the good day , I really wanted to shoot <unk> or <unk> , but I could only drag it to second one second -- but even a two second to get me to remember the recall .
This is a project that 's also a personal <unk> behavior , a kind of <unk> , an individual , and they 're going to show you a little bit about the music when they 've got a mobile phone .
They might not like it .
They 're seeing concerts on the phone .
I do n't like it . I admit , I 've been doing it as well , and I realized that , you know , let 's start documenting and keep videos and clean videos , but I 'm really sure that the <unk> of the day is , it 's a good way to make my research life . "
It just takes a second .
There 's three months of <unk> .
This is something that I 've been driving in my lifetime , driving the U.S. and Canada , every day , and it 's a fabulous life .
And then I spent a lot of money , and I had spent too much money on the door for a couple of years to spend a year , so I have to run a little bit of time with a few friends in Seattle .
One of the things I took out of a year was to spend a lot of time in my family , and it happened to me that my cousin , my mother , had a very bad day , where she was going to go to the emergency room and her situation was really bad .
We have a lot of a few times , and we did n't have to lose her , to my brothers every day .
And that makes me realize that the other important important thing in this project is that it 's very , very difficult to record his life .
It does n't look like -- if we want to do something cool , we might take a camera .
Or , " Oh , that 's great , I 'm going to take the <unk> . "
But we did n't do it very bad when we 're bad at bad things .
And this brings me to a very unfortunate moment of documenting life , even if it 's a second .
It will make you more <unk> .
Not a long day , but you do n't have a lot of fun , and I think it 's important to remember it .
All of the videos I 've recorded are never done , and what 's going to be done -- and I 'm hoping that the video that I 'm going to show you will look at my eyes .
And I started doing this with <unk> .
And I want to say <unk> two cameras , one of those <unk> , and I think that 's not what I want .
And the way to record my life is that I see what I saw .
Now , I have some ideas about this project , which is , if many people do this , would n't it be interesting ?
This is the last week when I was 31 .
I think if everybody is like me , it will be very interesting .
I think everyone will have a interpretation .
And I think everyone will come from a regular video every day .
And I do n't like to forget that , and documenting videos are very simple .
We have a video camera in each one of our pockets -- I bet most of you have -- or something like that -- and I do n't want to forget any day of my life , and that 's what I 'm going to do .
I do n't know , I think there 's a lot of possibilities , and I call you a little video every day , so you wo n't forget your life .
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> on new creatures
I want to introduce you to one of the projects that I 'm 16 years old , and it 's about building the project of <unk> life , which is about building life systems .
They 're based on the Netherlands , and they 're called it .
And then we 're going to show you a clip of this project that we 've seen before .
Narrator : Eventually , these <unk> will be independent in the beach .
Yves <unk> 's working on work .
<unk> : And I hope that it 's going to be more <unk> in the beach .
And they 're able to live in this independent way .
They learn to learn how to walk their lives to their own lives .
Narrator : These <unk> are n't derived from food , from the wind .
The wind takes off the speed of the wing , and you drive the elbow walking .
<unk> walking in the soft sands of the ice , and its nose , its nose .
And when it gets close to the waves , it breaks down , and then you stop and walk into the opposite direction .
Evolution creates a lot of species .
This piece is called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : This is the group of the gene code .
It 's also a species of species and unique species that will <unk> .
Look at this monster , right .
Now , ooh , right .
This is the species of species to harbor wind .
Yves <unk> seals the air on the head of the <unk> <unk> .
And so you can use these energy , and if you 're going to die or 95 percent of the energy energy can be able to go to the ceiling , because they 're easy to get it easy .
And I 'll show you this monster .
Thank you .
In order to walk , it 's critical to walking .
There 's 11 numbers , and I call it 11 figures .
And the numbers that make it go into the number is distances between <unk> .
In fact , this is a new wheels .
It works with normal wheels .
And on the end of the wheel , it 's going to stop in the same <unk> , and the <unk> stop .
In fact , it 's more powerful than the wheels , because when you try to take a bike on the beach , you find the bike dyslexic .
And what happens when the chaos - <unk> goes through the ice to the beaches of beach .
So in the end of the wheels , we created a new wheel , and we 're going to show you a little bit about the next video , where you show the videos that you 're playing with the video .
It 's able to walk , but it can get out of the wind .
It hits the <unk> .
This is just the amount of wind that 's just stored in the wind .
It 's a device that has sensors , and you can perceive that <unk> <unk> .
You see this monster , and it goes to the other direction .
Can you put my hand up ?
All right .
So they can avoid all the dangerous dangers of the beach , the biggest dangerous danger . This is sea sea .
It has to have a sense of perception .
It 's a water sensor .
It 's important that <unk> is very important , and normally it <unk> air when it hits the <unk> .
So imagine when animals walk to the sea .
When it comes to the sea , you can hear the sound of <unk> .
<unk> ! If it does n't feel , it 's okay , right ?
Here we have a diamond brain .
This is actually an experiment , and it 's the speed of <unk> walking .
It 's <unk> <unk> .
When it comes to the sea , it changes about zero and one <unk> , and then you can feel that it 's a simple brain .
The brain tells the <unk> , which is where , in the sand , where you 're in this place .
It helps life to cover a simple world of simplicity .
Thank you .
Another <unk> of <unk> is the storm .
This is a chunk of nose from the nose , and when his nose stops , it 's <unk> .
When the storm comes to the <unk> , it 's going to wake up in the <unk> <unk> to the Arctic .
And when the nose gets stuck , the <unk> are covered on the floor .
The wind change when the wind is changing , the treaties moves on the sun .
A few years later , these monsters can be able to live alone .
Now they need to help me .
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .

We 're announcing here today , the first generation of <unk> cells . This cells started with the computers on the computer , building chromosomes with <unk> chemical <unk> that will convert it into a receptor , and then it 's going to convert this cell to a new bacteria .
So this is one of the first things that we know in the Earth , and you know , what we 've learned is that a computer - sharing species replicate .
And also , it 's the origin of the species that have been called the <unk> code .
We 're going to talk more about <unk> .
And this project started in 15 years of our team called <unk> Foundation , and we 've launched the first <unk> of history in history .
We do experiments with <unk> flu , and we 're doing the smallest <unk> of self - organizing tissue , <unk> tissues , these chromosomes come from <unk> .
Once we get these <unk> sequences , if we think about it , whether it 's the smallest chromosome , or do you have smaller chromosomes ?
Can we understand the underlying properties of the cells in the gene ?
And over 15 years of exploration now , it 's possible to answer the question that the problem is that they 're going to take a lot of genes from cells .
You just get one .
We decided we had to do something that we have to achieve , even though nobody could achieve this area , and look at whether we could <unk> a nucleus of a bacterium , so we can actually tell the gene to understand the most fundamental gene for life .
So we started looking at 15 years of exploration now .
And before we did the first experiment , we invited <unk> <unk> teams to do a kind of <unk> for a new species on the laboratory , and the challenge , the moral problems , because there was no way of doing this .
They spent about two years of <unk> at the University of Singapore in 1999 .
And <unk> and I have gone for two years to work a piece of a human genome project , and when we finished it , we immediately went back to this project .
In 2002 , we created a new foundation of <unk> energy , and we 've launched two targets for the <unk> of our technology and how we 're going to understand the evolution of the environment , to try and understand what 's going on in our environment to understanding the underlying life of life .
In 2003 , we published our first results .
<unk> Smith and <unk> <unk> developed some new ways of building a new way of creating DNA .
Our first mission is to have 5,000 <unk> code that drive bacteria to drive infections .
This is <unk> <unk> , because we 've chosen it .
And it 's the first DNA gene that 's <unk> DNA , and the DNA chromosomes have already taken over the board .
When we realized that we can build 5,000 times the size of the speed of scale , we think we 're at least doing this , and try to create a series of pieces of paper that will link it to the population .
In reality , it 's essentially much longer than we start to think .
There 's a lot of steps that we 're going to get here , and there are two kinds of problems we need to solve a large amount of DNA molecules in the order of building a big DNA molecule , which we also have to deal with .
We have two groups of research , and a group of group is another group that tries to <unk> the entire chromosome to the new liver .
When we start working , we think that synthetic problems are the largest issues , which is why we 've chosen the smallest chromosomes .
Some of you might have found that we 're willing to abandon the smallest chromosomes and put it on larger chromosomes .
And what we need to explain is that , basically , the smaller cells need one , two months of time to get the result , and then the amount of cells are growing in two days , and it 's just five days .
So within a year we only had a few of these cycles for a cycle for six weeks .
You have to know , basically 99 , even more .
So this is more like the beginning of the <unk> , since the first stage , we do n't have any idea of how to get involved .
One of the most important things we published is in 2007 .
This is a viral epidemic from <unk> <unk> , from one bacterial vessel to another bacteria .
And I think , from philosophy , that 's one of the most important papers that we 've done because it shows life is so dynamic .
And we know that when it works , we actually have a chance that if we can build artificial chromosomes for the same kind of damage .
We did n't know that this would cost us for a few years .
In 2008 , we launched the whole <unk> <unk> genome for 500,000 dollars , but I did n't have the progress of this chromosome .
And we think that part of the reason is that it 's very close to the other , because the cells have all sorts of different personalities to stop this event .
And ultimately , the cells of the <unk> have a kind of <unk> , which is very , very happy to <unk> it , and it 's really happy that we have DNA DNA , so we 've never seen the DNA for it .
At the time , it was the largest <unk> of <unk> people .
So two aspects have progress , but part of the <unk> work has to be done or to do it , by using <unk> , to put those pieces into a <unk> .
This is an amazing progression of progress , but we also have a problem , because we 're going to have bacterial chromosomes .
So what we need to do is to solve the problem of how we 're going to get rid of the bacterial chromosomes , where you can take the bacteria from the inside of the liver .
So our team developed a new set of technologies to nurture and <unk> the entire bacteria , in <unk> .
So we did the same gene with <unk> , and we grew up with it in the <unk> as an engineered chromosomes .
We think that this will be a very nice experiment to learn how to take the chromosomes from <unk> and <unk> them .
When we take these experiments , even though we 're able to get rid of the chromosomes , we ca n't <unk> it into a cell .
This little problem took a research group for two years trying to solve it .
And finally , the DNA cells in the bacteria , in fact , is actually the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , and <unk> DNA .
And we found that if we took the chromosomes off into the <unk> , we would <unk> it .
And then we 've got bigger progress , when research is going to be <unk> by the genes of the group .
And once we did this , we could take the DNA of the <unk> from <unk> , and then <unk> it .
So , this autumn , when we 've been published in the magazine magazine , we 're all upset that we have a couple of weeks to get out of the market that 's going to come from the <unk> .
Because the problem with <unk> <unk> is that it 's about a year and a half or two years ago , we decided to make a larger chromosomes , a lot of chromosomes .
And Dan leaders are starting to engage with a range of times larger than the average population .
Turns out that this is not a simple job , it 's going to return back to three months of work , because we 're doing it in a range of times .
So research groups developed new types of <unk> software using it , and we can test every synthetic <unk> to see whether it 's growing in the chaos .
We found that 100 percent of the distances that we have in our gut are completely accurate to life in life .
And we 're going to zoom in in a piece of debris and found that only only one <unk> is swallowed in an important gene .
This is something that is very profound .
Some of the pieces of gene can not be glamorous , and then there are some components that we can put in a huge amount of DNA , like we 're doing a lot of wrong things about what we do .
So we took three months to find that mistake and <unk> it .
She 's the morning morning .
And I 've got the message of the afternoon , and I told you the first one was invented .
This is a long process to get from the beginning of the 15 years .
We feel that one of the principles of this region is that we can discriminate that the <unk> DNA and Nature DNA and Nature DNA .
<unk> , when you 're working on a new scientific field , you have to think about all of the trap that you 've never seen before , even worse , to make other examples of people that feel worse .
So what we think is the worst problem is that the chromosomes of the chromosome preventing us to believe that I 've made a synthetic cell , but it 's just a pollution .
And so we changed our idea of trying to put a tag on DNA to determine whether DNA is synthesized .
In 2008 , we 've created the first chromosomes with half a million dollars to <unk> the gene that we 're going to make , and it 's called the <unk> gene , but it is a translation of <unk> <unk> .
So research groups developed a new code of code , including code .
This is a new set of code to translation and monitor DNA .
Now , some of the areas that are in the gene code are <unk> in a very long period of time , but they 're just a mathematician , rather than biologist <unk> , because you have a long - term code for math , and it 's more likely to create a new protein and bad gene .
<unk> and his research team developed the code of a lot of stopping symbols , which is a different type of alphabet that allows us to use the whole English analogy and the digital figures and numbers .
Four main icon in all of these thousand <unk> code .
First of all , there 's actually a code in which it actually makes the code .
So in the other way , there 's this <unk> of <unk> writers and making key solutions to people who are going to make this project today .
We also shot a website on the website , and if someone had these <unk> in the code , they would send letters to email to that address .
This is a difference between the other species of species , which is that there are <unk> names associated with its own website .
We 've also developed <unk> because of the first gene , because we do n't have a sense of what it means to be a <unk> .
We 're not going to give you the code , but we 're giving this continuity .
The first is , " Life has to be wrong , and there is a failure , there 's a success , it 's creating life . "
This is James <unk> .
And the second is , " Take the things , do n't look at what they 're looking at . "
This is the <unk> of the American Revolution .
And the last thing is Richard <unk> . I ca n't understand anything .
Because this is a progress progress in science , but also a philosophical progress , we try to solve philosophy and technology .
And I think the last thing that 's going to happen in the beginning is that the <unk> of the moral statements that we 're doing in morality are not just technological , not only in technology , but it 's also about the scientific debate on the political and the federal government .
And even about this statement , we 're doing this job in 2003 , and it 's going to work on the House of the White House to decide how to make this work and edit .
And eventually they decided that they were going to release it right , and we did this for the White House to do a lot of <unk> about Congress , trying to refine political policy and progress .
So I 'm going to pop my question on the question .
at the end .
<unk> : You can explain how big it is for the <unk> language .
<unk> : How do we explain it ?
I do n't know how big we can explain it .
It 's very profound for us .
Maybe this is a big philosophy of philosophy , about how we view life .
We actually think that this is just the first time we 've spent 15 years of success , and we 're going to do a experiments that we want to learn about the most basic levels of life .
But we believe that this will become a very powerful tool , and we 've already begun to use this tool .
We have a project in the Institute of Medicine , and we 're trying to try and use these new <unk> tools to use this new toolbox , which might be able to make <unk> last year .
Because even before the previous cost of <unk> , even 12 months later , they 're going to build these MIT studies , and they 're able to create this for 24 hours .
So when you look at the creation of the building vaccine , I think we can <unk> this process , which is very , very useful .
In the area of the vaccine , the <unk> company and the Foundation will create a new vaccine company because we think that the tools will be very effective for vaccine disease , which is a very rapid evolving disease for these viruses .
Would n't it be a good thing to do with regular flu ?
Or even more importantly , HIV is so fast that this virus has been evolving so much faster today .
In the same way , we 've been working on the <unk> of the environment .
I think that the Gulf of Mexico has been an intentional .
We do n't see CO2 , we depend on it , and we 're looking at the results of the <unk> cycle of <unk> , but we can see that carbon dioxide , but we can see that carbon dioxide is swimming through the water .
We need something to do to gasoline oil .
We have a partnership with <unk> <unk> , and we 're trying to <unk> algae in the atmosphere that can be able to absorb CO2 from atmosphere and <unk> cells to create a new bean that goes into the atmosphere .
This is just something that we think of .
<unk>
One day , <unk> <unk> sits down and down the door , and as a non - Muslims , she can see the <unk> of Islam from " <unk> , " and she has a surprising evidence of <unk> in the dictionary , to <unk> the kindness of the arc of romantic <unk> and the warmth of a <unk> speech .
culture , global issues , journalism , religion
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : A read of water
You might have heard about the <unk> of heaven , and there are 72 virgins . I promise you will go back to the gallery .
In fact , in the face of this , we live in a place where the real rainforest is very similar to the actual <unk> , which is the definition of <unk> .
Because I had to go through the boat with a boat in <unk> , so I understood it really .
But the question is , why do most people are familiar with this ?
I know a lot of non - Muslims trying to read <unk> , but ultimately , it 's going to give up , because it 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> argues that <unk> is one of the greatest heroes in the world , even though he thinks it 's <unk> , " I 'm sick of <unk> . "
Part of the reason , I think , is that we 're going to be able to think of it as a lot of <unk> -- like we can use a afternoon afternoon , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> in the chairs , like God -- it 's the author of God .
But in fact , it 's only about <unk> , which is why <unk> is so easy to say -- or , maybe , mistakes are silenced .
People are <unk> to me called " <unk> <unk> , " Muslims <unk> and <unk> Muslims .
So in the last spring , when I started writing <unk> , I realized I had to read <unk> -- of course , to better .
And my Arabic is already going to be able to go to the point that it 's appropriate to use , so I 've found the famous <unk> <unk> , and I 'm trying to read them through the bottom line , the line of <unk> and the <unk> of a seven - century <unk> artist .
I do n't have a problem .
What I 've seen recently is the story of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , because it 's because of the early histories of Islam , so I 'm familiar with the lessons that the history of Islamic history has been <unk> over the course of history .
I know enough , or I 'll know that I 'm going to be a pediatrician - handed <unk> -- I have at least an individual who has ever seen a <unk> , even though it 's an experience , but anyway , it does n't have an <unk> .
So I had to tell you that .
I 'm going to work with three weeks of this project , and this is what it 's called " respect . "
I have <unk> the last end of the end , and I read the <unk> , but clearly , even more mysterious .
But every time I thought I was going to go to the Grand Canyon -- " I realized that feeling " feel " feeling -- in <unk> , the next morning would wake up , and I would <unk> me at a unfamiliar area .
This is what it is to attract <unk> and <unk> .
So it 's all about <unk> the story of the Bible , like <unk> , Moses , Joseph , <unk> .
And God is absolutely familiar , from one point from the beginning of a <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> the world .
And the <unk> of the book appeared , and the mountain of gold and chief and <unk> had taken me back to the year of the desert desert .
There 's language , <unk> <unk> , let me return back to the <unk> of the night and listening to a long - term <unk> for hours .
And then I started to understand why it 's true Arabic that Arabic is true .
Take the <unk> , the beginning of <unk> and Islam , from <unk> and Islam .
It 's just a <unk> Arabic word Arabic , but it 's at least to use 65 to 72 words .
But the more they use it , they seem to lose more .
There 's a myth in Arabic , which is <unk> , and it 's <unk> .
It 's just going to be thrown down , and it 's going to get rid of the ear of it .
So <unk> <unk> is just about its shadow , or like <unk> , saying , " A <unk> . "
But not all that would be lost in translation .
And so , as <unk> promised , the patient will get a lot of surprises -- it 's like , you know , a little bit about the perception of the environment , humans are only created by God , and those are the Bible <unk> .
These are the ones in the Bible who are just talking about <unk> , and the second number of men and three men call it <unk> -- for example , <unk> brothers and women -- <unk> and <unk> .
For instance , the <unk> of <unk> , for example , is about killing the sentences .
Yeah , there 's this saying that there is this , but in a very particular situation , it 's been allowed to be allowed by the invasion of <unk> in the city , and this is a limitation that is limited to war .
It 's not saying that you 're going to kill the <unk> , but you can , you 've got to be allowed to do that , and only after the end , only when they 're trying to get rid of you , there 's only a couple of other strategies that they want to stop you .
Even at that point -- God , <unk> , forgive <unk> -- so , the best way to accomplish it .
This may be the biggest surprise -- how hard it is , at least for those who are n't glamorous .
" Some <unk> <unk> " , and it said , " But there are others .
<unk> is going to be looking for the <unk> part , and they 're trying to figure out what to do with it .
Only God knows what real meaning . "
" God is the word " <unk> , " and in fact , the whole thing is more difficult than most of us in the entire world .
For example , this little problem in the <unk> and the heaven .
It 's acting in the old East .
There is a word that is used by four and a half days , and this is the girl who has the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the chest .
But in the seventh century , there 's only one word : <unk> .
There was no hint of the ice or the high pressure or the high altitude of <unk> .
And it might be used to describe <unk> biology -- a way of <unk> -- or something like that , or it 's the equivalent of the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> .
But it 's really no one who knows what it is .
Because <unk> is very clear that you 're going to become " a new kind of life , " and you will be shaped as an alternative form , which is more glamorous than a textbook .
And again , 72 percent of the numbers did n't appear .
In <unk> , there are no 72 virgins .
This is a characterization of the <unk> of 300 years of <unk> , and most Islamic scholars are sitting in the middle of his day , <unk> the wing - <unk> population .
It 's a really opposite heaven .
It 's not <unk> ; it 's glamorous .
It was <unk> .
It 's <unk> gardens .
Thank you .

<unk> , with her students , took a portrait of a <unk> pen and a leopard of dust , <unk> Arizona , trying to study complex groups of complex systems .
Featured , MacArthur grant , biology , collaboration , design , science

<unk> <unk> on ants .
I study ants because I like to think about how organizations work .
And especially in particular , how to organize the whole behavior of behavior in action .
So , <unk> groups are a good example . There are many other examples of the Internet .
For example , a lot of organisms -- like the brain , <unk> groups , development of development .
There are about 30,000 ants around the world .
And they were able to do it all over the way , and every single one of them was a little leopard or a leopard . All of you saw that there was no female <unk> .
All the <unk> , the same qualities , is no central control .
There is no ant being told .
The queen is only the eggs . It 's not called the <unk> .
They did n't have the same behavior for the ants .
So I tried to understand the principles of <unk> .
I 've been studying a life in the last 20 years , in <unk> , of the <unk> of the <unk> of Arizona .
This is my research site where the trees are ant ants , and it 's just a romantic <unk> .
And these ants are called <unk> , because they ate the seeds of the plants .
This is the vessel of <unk> groups , which is <unk> <unk> .
And they would go to the place where they were 20 meters outside the seeds , and they brought the seeds to the <unk> .
And every year I went to my research , and I would draw the distribution of <unk> .
This is a path , and it does n't , you know , about 250 meters , the other side is 400 meters .
And I took each bowl of <unk> , and I held numbers on the rock . I was looking for a year in the last year .
That 's what I know about their age .
And that 's because , as you get older , it grows more , and I can study that change .
I want to tell you about the life of <unk> groups .
The ant is not able to get more ant , and they 're going to save them .
Every single year per year is <unk> ant -- these ants have wings -- they 're <unk> .
So , every year , and in the same year -- this is the most amazing thing -- every single year . Everyone 's got rid of the wing , there 's the wings .
This is the queen of a <unk> . That 's its wing .
It 's <unk> with this leopard , and there 's a cow on it .
Normally the queen would always be .
That 's the dead man dead after you die .
And then the queen goes up to one place , <unk> the wing , and they 're going to dig up a hole in the black hole .
They 're going to live in the last 15 or 20 years , and it 's used to be used for the <unk> eggs .
And the birds are living in the cave .
It 's vegetables , and it 's feeding -- the ants are beginning to be poor , they 're <unk> .
It <unk> the fat of the body to feed his body .
And the first <unk> ants came out of them , and they came up with <unk> and then became <unk> .
And they <unk> , and they 're going to get rid of the ice , but the queen 's never found it .
This is a year old , <unk> <unk> .
That 's <unk> <unk> , which is the pen , as a pen .
This is a <unk> group in summer last summer .
This is three - year - old bears .
That 's <unk> <unk> , which is the pen , as a pen .
And those ants made a huge amount of garbage -- all of the meat that ate the seeds .
This is five - year - old <unk> groups , and this is <unk> , which is a pen , a pen .
This is the largest <unk> , about a meter wide .
This shows the scale of the poorest group and the number of miles -- that 's about 10,000 <unk> -- over a few years of change in the years .
There 's no ant . It 's just about five years after the queen , and it grows in one million or 100 million ants .
And the number of people die in the queen , and when the birds get to 15 or 20 years old , when it does n't kill more ants .
When the number of people in the ant are <unk> , the ants will start whistling .
That 's the amount of wing and the queen that goes to love .
And the reason I know about conservatives is that the increase in the age of <unk> , because I do n't know how long it is to survive , it 's a ant ant .
And that 's really interesting , but it 's not the most playful process .
And what 's really about the question of the ant , I think , is called " <unk> . "
This is not the principle of <unk> organizations , but how to change the workplace .
How do we respond to the changes in the context of the environment ?
For example , <unk> always meet <unk> .
It rain in summer , rain desert .
It 's a huge amount of damage to <unk> , and it needs a lot more .
And when there 's more food , you know , when you get out of it -- it needs a lot of ants to collect food .
But since there 's no ant being told what to do , how do you <unk> the number of people who work at work ?
I call this the process of <unk> .
And in these <unk> , I 've seen the ants that I saw in the <unk> of four : this ant is thriving , and it goes out of the way , and it 's looking at food , looking for food , and it goes through the food path to the soul , looking at food to move into food and move it into the way food is going to bring food back to it , to try to come back and get food turning through food as it comes to food go back into its own way .
<unk> -- that should be a lens -- a bunch of fun , they 've gone out of the animal , and they 're starting to refine it .
And they managed to be sure that the <unk> of the bear can be in the direction of a month -- it 's just <unk> -- they 're able to get the ants that are safe to travel .
<unk> ants are working on the <unk> , and what I want to say is a very similar house with Bill <unk> 's house .
Because there 's a lot of <unk> on top of the soil , and they 've got a bunch of a hundred - meter <unk> .
<unk> is very similar to the caves that people live in .
And the ant ants that work in <unk> are working on the <unk> of the <unk> , and then the dry soils drop into the <unk> .
So you can see that these ants came out of the soil , and then you put some soil off , then she goes back and down and down .
And finally , the ant ants that come to the end of the junk that put it into the <unk> of <unk> .
So you see these ants seals in <unk> .
And this day , junk seals , they 're going to get rid of the garbage , and they 're going to get rid of it .
That 's the job of <unk> junk .
That four percent of those bears work in the <unk> .
These bears are only 25 percent of the population , and they 're the most <unk> ants .
So that 's where the ant comes from the <unk> .
When we look at the <unk> , we found that these seals are going to be more than half a meter .
And then there 's a long way to come up with a very large deadline and a small , and we 've found that the queen is actually looking at the queen , and we 've got eight days later on the back of the hand . "
I know that a little bit of glass does n't work for me , not to give me my own students , but because , in fact , <unk> <unk> comes out of the boat , and so often they 're <unk> in the underground floor .
This is all a bunch of <unk> .
And the queen is here , and it 's only the eggs .
That 's <unk> , they eat most of the food .
It reflects a lot of ants in the upper half of the polar bear , and you 're looking at it .
They took the food back to the <unk> .
The polar bears came into the <unk> of food , just to put food on top of it , on the bottom of the chain , from underneath the poor , and put the food out of their mouth , putting food into <unk> , <unk> the seeds .
And those <unk> ants work on the entire <unk> .
It 's a very strange , very interesting thing to do when you look at the ant .
So , as the Bible says , look at these ants , <unk> , and in fact , you can actually think of the ants as <unk> .
That means that if it happened -- but I never found anything like this , but it 's only about 20 years -- if they 're going to work , they can do it .
But in fact , they 're all <unk> .
And I think that this is a very interesting question -- the problem of how to organize the effort of work is possible to understand the effects of the ant .
They work like the ant who 's working on their toes and the ants that work outside of the <unk> .
If you work on the body of the <unk> , and then you put it out , you 're never going to discover that you will never find them .
So in fact , when it 's young young people , they 're working on <unk> .
And then comes into the <unk> .
And the last group of teams is done by the outside .
And when you work on the outside , they will never meet .
The ants -- mostly ants , including these <unk> , vision and bad .
They have the eyes , they tell you that light and darkness , but they 're usually working on smell .
What I 'm going to argue is that people are not the right to be true -- even if the queen has intelligence in the room to send chemical information to it , it 's not possible to <unk> the amount of information that 's working on the body , but that information is not very likely to expand through the ant .
So , from that , we know that the teeth are not working on groups .
So when I started studying anthropology , my first question is , what 's different about the ant ?
What do you have to do with the ant ant ?
What 's the ant ant in the upper <unk> of the Gulf ?
And I 've always been doing this : That 's the <unk> of each ant from born , and it 's all about independent jobs , but also to understand what 's going on on the line .
Instead , I 'm going to ask you about how different different types of work are connected ?
So I did a experiment , and it changed .
So , for example , I put my toes on the <unk> of <unk> , and I 'm going to use a lot of work with the ants that they 're working on every day .
This is the map of the 20 minutes .
This is about 40 minutes later .
These bears moved all over the place .
And then what I want to know is that , well , this situation needs to have a lot of money to use a much more responsible ant , and whether it 's going to work for other jobs ?
Next step we have to do with these markers .
This is some of the blue <unk> ants .
And then we did a little bit more complex with three different colors .
And so we can tag every ant that 's covered , and we know what only it is .
And we started with the <unk> model , and we found that these nice little <unk> pen were really good .
And I just just summarize the results of the experiment , and that 's the difference between different things .
So if you 've changed the number of bears , you have to change the number of bears .
So , for example , if you have <unk> ants , responsibility for <unk> ant , I found that the ant bears were <unk> .
That accounts for all sorts of work .
And the second conclusion that we 're going to have a lot of people who are surprised , is that ants are <unk> work .
A ant does n't get the same job .
So for example , if you look at the food that 's there , it 's about the other ants , the ants 's ant -- they 're not going to take the job of it , and they do n't want to get out of their job , they 're the bears .
The ant bears are also the bears .
The ants in the <unk> are also true .
But not anything . This represents how it transformed .
As I said , if there 's more food to stay , the ant ants in the police are responsible for <unk> ants to make sure that they 're poor .
And if there 's a more <unk> task to do it , like I 've made them a little bit of a problem , so I need to make a lot of <unk> ants , and they 're responsible for the ant ants that can transform <unk> ants .
But if you need to be more responsible for <unk> ants , like to get rid of the <unk> -- there 's no job for the ant who will come back to the copyright ant , and they have to bring responsibility from <unk> ant .
And so the bears are able to do it , and the ants that work in the <unk> are <unk> .
And finally , it looks like each ant is trying to decide what to do .
For example , if you need to do a <unk> job , the ant bears will not change . I know they wo n't do it .
But the ant bears , because there 's a few ways of trying to help .
So the most amazing result is <unk> .
This process is in the age of <unk> , like this .
When I do experiments with older bears -- it 's about five or a half years worth of <unk> -- they 're going to be more stable from one situation to another situation , which is more <unk> , more self - balancing .
And those who are young people -- only two years of <unk> ants -- seem much more intense .
And even more amazing , the ant <unk> a year .
Maybe this year or that year .
So , in the older age of the old age , the <unk> ants are more <unk> , they 've got the young ones who are very old .
It 's not because older bears have experience , more smart .
It 's because the <unk> <unk> , the entire organization , has changed .
And the biggest thing about the change is the size of the group .
Since I came to this conclusion , I spent a long period of time trying to figure out what the ant used to do -- a very simple way to decide about it -- very easy , a little bit of <unk> or chemical information , which is <unk> , so that there 's no ant , and every ant can see what 's going on at the same time -- and that 's what a ant does .
And it 's also going to depend on the <unk> of the group .
And even further , I found that ants are using intimacy .
The people who see the ants can see their reflection .
They 've got tentacles .
And when a ant used to touch the other ants , it would say it 's in the <unk> , and the ants can tell you , you know , each other or the ant does n't have the same ant , because they 're <unk> by a <unk> <unk> .
And so we know that ants are connected by the <unk> ant , and the amount of <unk> that we have to do with <unk> is to decide what it is .
So the information of the polar bear is not glamorous , and they 're actually <unk> .
<unk> itself is information .
I think a little bit more quickly .
But first you might want to know about how it is , because , for example , I 'm poor .
I expect that I would never meet other bears .
But if I have a lot of responsibility for <unk> ants , I 'm not happy to eat .
So it had to know the difference between the bears , the difference between the bears .
We already know that there are creatures in the ant -- I suspect that the other organisms are like -- these hydrocarbons , the <unk> of the ants , in different <unk> , different varieties of <unk> .
And what we 're doing is that it 's because the amount of time that you spend on the bottom of the day , the more <unk> changes in the surface , so they have different <unk> .
And so they 're able to use it to be different from the surface of the sphere , and different <unk> of <unk> -- they can use the dopamine of these <unk> to the other .
We 've shown this principle recently : we put <unk> hydrocarbons on small <unk> , and it <unk> down the right frequencies .
And it turns out that ants are right in the right frequency to touch these little <unk> <unk> , like they interact with real ants .
So I want to show you a little clip -- and what you 're seeing here is the <unk> of the <unk> .
That 's where the ants came .
They go to different jobs , and when they go into the <unk> , they make sense , or influence each ant , what work is to work .
This is from the generator . This is in <unk> .
One of the beginning you can see is that ants seem to be playing with fiber <unk> .
But the point is that these ants stay there , and every one of each other is " other ants . "
And the frequency of these <unk> is determined if the ant came up and did what they did .
And you can see that the ant coming up in the <unk> .
Every ant , when it comes back , it 's <unk> other ants .
And those who are waiting in the Arctic to decide whether they 're going to go back and have the ant contact with the ants .
So the most interesting part of this system is <unk> .
This is <unk> , and there are a lot of <unk> .
One is the experience of the ants -- each ants 's experience -- is n't very precise .
Because the frequency of the ants came back to the <unk> of every ant at the negotiating table .
And the ability to <unk> this is that the capabilities of the ants are <unk> , because no polar bear can do very precisely .
So we 've done a lot of simulation experiments trying to figure out what these two <unk> are , as a whole , <unk> - <unk> behavior .
And at the same time , I do n't think that this kind of <unk> way that you can build a factory in the factory , <unk> and productivity .
In fact , if you look at these ants , you end up trying to get them to help them , because it 's always looking at what you think they should be using .
So because these <unk> are n't perfect .
But it works well .
It 's already been alive .
They 're everywhere , except in Antarctica .
And it 's a very successful way of doing this , which is really successful , to make a difference .
And the other thing that we 're looking at is the approach to change the <unk> of the ant -- and this communication network -- to improve the efficiency of destruction .
But the way that I want you to remember is that these are the ways that those connections are related to the scale of <unk> groups .
And the easiest explanation is that when a ant is in small portions of <unk> -- of course , the same rules of ants are going to say , " I think I want to drink each other . "
But in small micro - <unk> , this polar bear , it 's a little bit of <unk> ant , and only because of the polar bears , they do n't normally sit down .
So the <unk> community came up with big , much older , and the rules were <unk> in the size .
Thank you .

Neil <unk> : <unk> <unk>
And what we 're going to talk about is the thing about digital revolution , but I want to say , that revolution is over .
We 've got a digital revolution , and we 're not going to do it .
And I hope that you can see what happens to the digital Revolution .
Okay , so I 'll tell you .
And I 'm involved in MIT , and I have a couple of projects that need to change the computer revolution .
The first one is , " The Internet zero , which is a network of the Internet , and it 's the price associated with the complexity of an e - control , so that it can be <unk> in every single light bulb and so on .
And the interesting thing about it is that it does n't cost the internet .
In the way , it 's a kind of <unk> <unk> for the Internet to <unk> you , and you can spread through <unk> or <unk> , through wires or radio attacks .
And what it does is , it 's the most early principle of the Internet , which is where the computer is connected , and the computer is now connected to each other .
We can apply this to the next generation of the Internet , which is also designed to use the Web for the patient .
And this is where it comes from here , and that 's where people are participating .
And then there 's the alternative computers .
In terms of economics , <unk> goods are the ones that can stretch .
In other words , the price of <unk> - <unk> <unk> , but half of the <unk> computers are <unk> a whole <unk> or a full computer , and we 're trying to make the computer to the way that the computer comes to that direction .
You see the back behind that .
It comes from a student named Bill <unk> 's student , and he 's now thinking about why , why do we have to create a smaller chip , rather than building smaller chips instead of creating small chips ?
This is the show of the work .
On the left side , on the right - hand side of the traditional <unk> , that 's the <unk> of our first prototype machine , and we 're only collecting materials -- no frames <unk> and <unk> .
It does n't mean that the dots here are <unk> , and this is a primitive material .
And the number of materials are <unk> , and the thing is <unk> .
If the leopard <unk> moves through its center , it does n't do anything .
If you need more resources , you have to use computers .
That 's the beginning of the <unk> , the computation of information .
And this is also the traditional figures , and it 's the first prototype of the early Times , which is slowed down .
We can also combine chemical integration , and then the light can become <unk> .
This is the process of creating little <unk> , and this is a display that you 're looking at .
And we can do that now with computational emotions that can make the information for the robot , and this is some of the slides that I 've ever seen in the early days . This is a little bit of a <unk> that is <unk> on the nucleus .
And all of this is happening in the laboratory rather than <unk> , but it 's really <unk> with atoms together to make these studies .
We all have a digital revolution , but what does it mean ?
And in the ' 40s of the 20th century , it 's going to take us from here to a signal that goes from <unk> to the Internet , and he also asks us that the first truth is that , if you keep increasing information , that theory is saying , " If you 're growing up , you can do it in a perfect installation . "
This is how we invent the Internet .
And the same thing that Von Neumann did at the ' 50s , and he said , you can have an e - computer , but you could get it to perfect , the last big simulation of MIT , which is the second big application of Wikipedia , how much it takes you to do it .
And lo and behold , we had a <unk> , which was the first two billion <unk> for the first time .
But all of our building is done on this lower corner .
One of the great planes of <unk> in East Asia is that it 's going to take the metal , or <unk> the plastic , and a 100 billion , a hundred billion <unk> , which is the village <unk> -- and that 's where the tribal police are in place .
This system is <unk> <unk> , and it 's not just information about information .
And then we heard about the story of molecular biology from the beginning , and that 's through computation .
It 's also a <unk> system .
We 've done a digital revolution in communication and computing , but the same idea is that the math -- the <unk> and the Von Neumann , and it 's not going to happen in the real physical world -- and I 've got this idea of <unk> <unk> , which is a group of people who do n't want to go through the center of the arc of a piece of light , so that , in fact , there 's a whole bunch of things that people have n't seen before , because , of course , the
You can hear it tomorrow from Susan <unk> . He 's the first student from this project .
And so we thought , how do we do that with computational computing ?
This is one of the things he made , which is to prove that his idea is possible to be able to use the way that it can use some <unk> , and you can write a code for protein to make a protein like this , so that can be very precise .
There 's no digital material that 's going to make the structure of the protein , which means that you can do something like this .
And you can do other things . This is the demonstration of the <unk> show .
And that video here , which is not glamorous , is self - replicating and <unk> , and we 've now done nine extra levels of folding , we 're doing this experiment with the DNA of DNA , but it 's going to be done by a protein that 's produced by <unk> <unk> .
And there 's the laser <unk> machine , which is actually the 3D <unk> of the figures , and even if you do n't start building rooms , it 's not going to start at the bottom , but let 's try to make it work .
These are some of the emerging technologies that we have in our lab in the lab , and it 's all about digital manufacturing , the computer is no longer the control of tools , but it is not a tool , it can <unk> the structure .
We 're doing this with eight - year - olds , and you 've got all of this -- I 've bought all these machines -- we 're going to be able to create a very small matrix , which we do n't want to make any size , because you ca n't make the digital <unk> or one size .
So we 've got attention - <unk> <unk> and <unk> the water and the <unk> system .
But the question is , when we get all these machines , I go to a lot of time .
And then <unk> had a class called " How do n't we just start doing something like a few academics , just to give a couple of graduate students .
But the first story of the curriculum is this .
There are hundreds of years of all the students who say , I 've been waiting for a few years , and I can give you anything for <unk> .
And then <unk> asked me , " Well , you 're not going to do this in front of the world ? "
The other thing that makes people laugh is that these students are n't doing research .
They chose to learn what to do .
They do n't have traditional technologies .
By the way , they can <unk> their own skills .
Now you can see a video . Kevin is a <unk> , and this is what she 's doing .
Hi , I 'm a <unk> . This is the portrait I made .
Have you ever had this experience that you 'd like to scream , but it 's not allowed , maybe you 're working in school or your school , or you are looking at the kids or something else .
All right , I 'm going to tell you a little bit about the scream , which is a <unk> <unk> .
When the users scream in <unk> , their screaming was <unk> .
And it 's also recorded , and you 're able to take any amount of time and to release these <unk> .
And Einstein would love this .
And the students made a browser for <unk> , which allowed the Internet to go online and interact with other contacts .
This is the posture of a student , and you have to be able to wrestle with it , to show you that it 's a <unk> that can protect your personal space .
It does n't require technology to promote communication ; it 's the opposite .
This is a device that helps you to see yourself .
This student created a machine that could make machines in the machine , and he did it through <unk> .
This <unk> , for a few years , I realized that the students were showing the most powerful features of what they made , the market that they did .
If these things can be bought , you do n't need a self - creation , but because you need it , so you create it .
Ken <unk> once said that nobody would put the computers in the house .
But obviously , none of the computers in the house have been invented or <unk> , and you do n't need to produce a building in house - building computers because it 's easy to buy it .
You have it , because you 've got a unique thing , not a functional .
This is about 20 million dollars per year in the next 20 years , and we can create <unk> <unk> , allowing us to do anything .
My students are directly like " <unk> , " and I 've got the machine to make a personal manufacturing .
So today , if you 're going to spend a lot of money , because that 's the money of government , and they ask us to move the project to the workplace , let 's bring the curriculum to place , to try to make a website , to make a website and so on .
So I did the opposite of the National Museum of Natural History , and I said , we 're not going to talk about how this project is , but we promise the tools to open out .
That 's not something that <unk> <unk> , but we 're going to make these two billion dollars in the device , and it 's the equivalent of two million dollars to the project .
There 's a laser cutter to make things like 3D <unk> , and then one <unk> is a digital transmitter , which is less than one dollar - to - a - half dollar algorithm , 10 meters long , from the <unk> of the world .
This is a project that does n't have a good job , but it 's still coming from Boston to India to South Africa -- <unk> <unk> to the South - South Pacific , where we are <unk> the attention of the population , and we 're able to find <unk> computers in all places .
And in the villages of the village , his kids are concerned about measuring and changing the world , and only from the screen .
In fact , it 's actually about building connections that are much larger than the numbers .
The solution is not so much that it 's not a priority , but the technology of the future .
And we saw the same process in a place where we did n't think about it , and we had a little bit of a <unk> press -- it would be crazy now .
And we 're being <unk> by the people who are people , because as far as the Scientific Lab , what 's happening is a liberal arts .
You can see that delight from their faces .
This is a girl in Boston who did a little <unk> design design .
From that easy product to some kind of stuff that needs to take care of , this is all happening in the media community , and we 've done a laboratories in Ghana .
We engineered a network sensor , and kids will come in and do n't leave the lab .
There 's a girl who keeps us up to night , and I love the Media Lab .
And that 's her first <unk> in the future , she 's going to do a sensor .
And it 's been working on work , learning how to do it , because she does n't know what they 're doing or why she 's doing this , and she tells her that she is going to be doing it .
And then I was 11 o'clock in the evening , and I thought , I 'm the only person to see her work and she 's really surprised with her .
And I looked at it for the big company , and I could n't see it , because the fact that the girl does anything , they could do something better , but they needed a lot of people to do it in a variety of different areas .
My name is <unk> <unk> .
I did a flat plate .
It 's pure .
And then these tools are doing some of the most important solutions of agriculture , which is designed to design the power of energy for the energy of Ghana , for <unk> <unk> .
And then the commercial thing that came up with was grown to growth , like this kind of structure .
Finally , laboratories start to invent .
We learn more about them than we 've got .
And I took my kids to this kind of stuff , and let him see how it works .
They 've developed a way to use <unk> to make <unk> you see on the screen now , and now it 's a company where they 're working on MIT , the MIT design , there are three students who are doing research , because the design of the children 's design is even more beautiful because kids designed it .
So there 's all sorts of discoveries that are going to vary in these <unk> .
Last year , I talked to some of the countries and governments and civic leaders that they want to do , and I 've never been able to say that , now , we do n't see anything .
In 20 years , we 're going to see these things very profound .
And then I realized what was going to happen . <unk> and Doug developed in a <unk> machine .
And <unk> is a machine between <unk> and <unk> .
It was a huge deal , and it was <unk> , but it brought the computer to the laboratory and everything we had from there .
Now this is the cost of the money and the complexity of the public community , and it 's very much like the <unk> of the community .
The Digital Genome Atlas is not the future . We 're in the ' 80s .
We talked about the great innovation of the time .
It was chaos , and people did n't know what to happen .
We are here today , in the ' 80s , digital <unk> .
The only problem is that it stops people with people .
And I visited all the <unk> institutions in Washington , and I traveled to any organization where you can imagine that the organization they want to talk about , but they 're going to break their organization , they do n't allow them to do things . Even from law .
This is a problem that is so big that it comes from the most important new invention from this community , which is social , and it 's a lot of social papers that are close to the Arctic , in the northern hemisphere , looking at the end of the sun , that looks like a little house on the horizon .
They 're hoping that they 're going to be able to find animals in the hills , but laboratories are very rapidly very quickly , and they decided to build a village for this laboratory .
This is n't a university ; it 's not a company that 's essentially a <unk> village , which is really good people who live around the world , and there 's all sorts of things that have been there .
We 're now becoming a stable <unk> for people to make projects , and also a <unk> fund .
We think that the people who are trying to take this money to get the money in the labs , as those laboratories are going to continue to do it , and it 's a chain of winds , which is a wind - wing <unk> <unk> , so they 're going to do a lot of research for MIT .
And I want to conclude with two things .
And we 've seen a huge change in this area where it 's going to vary in the bottom , from the ceiling of the glass revolution , based on <unk> projects that make sure that each person can get it .
But we 're still <unk> about the principles of <unk> .
<unk> , communication , energy , still <unk> in a few companies .
If it 's enough of this room , you can also solve these problems .
The information from the <unk> Foundation is the world 's other five billion people , and they 're not technologies , they 're also producers of producers .
The biggest opportunity is that the ability to capture the world 's world is to be able to design and create a product that needs for their local needs .
I thought it was 20 years later , but we 've seen it today .
This developed all kinds of organizations we can imagine .
The most difficult thing is to think about social thinking , social evolution , but it 's happening .
And finally , the last talk about the future of <unk> is going to mention Moore 's Law , and that 's the picture that I love , which is the beginning of the <unk> Moore , where we see , we 've seen growth and growth , progress , productivity , growth improvement , but then we 'll see that there 's a huge amount of money , what we need to see is that this is a big <unk> .
But the other thing that we 're going to do is come from the <unk> to three - to - a - half years of engineering programming , which is ultimately ultimately the final functional functional .
And what we 're doing here is the side of the figures of this revolution , which is the real equivalent of reality .
So this two project answered my question , and I did n't ask these questions about the <unk> of the world , MIT , who showed a <unk> in the developing world for a person who had n't seen a market , a disorder that I had never seen before .
This is an incredible amount of <unk> , which is the GDP of the number of stars , allowing people to create their own problems . Thank you .
<unk>
American consumption is about 25 percent of the world , but energy <unk> <unk> suggests that America does n't have any energy policy in the United States , whether it 's going to be <unk> to the future of a future , and then we 're trying to see the <unk> that we have n't been able to live in a world of oil ? And then , how do we spend a lot of energy ?
alternative power , culture , economics , energy , technology
<unk>
T : <unk> reform -- gas - <unk>
I 'm a <unk> .
I do n't believe that global warming is very good at this subject .
But what I 'm going to talk about is the national security security .
We have to stop oil for the enemy .
I mean , I 've got to buy oil for oil .
Now let me bring you back to a hundred years ago , I 'm going to return to you .
And you might think that 's the year I was born .
No , I was born in <unk> .
But let 's go back to the tragedy of the 2007 10 years , we 've got what we 're facing .
The same thing that we have today is just different levels of fuel .
In 100 years of course , what we 're looking at is coal , our attention is the whale <unk> and the oil .
At that time , we 're looking at a much more cheap fossil , but it 's not our right - <unk> organization .
In <unk> , we 've chosen the oil <unk> and the coal <unk> .
But then we look at the next 10 years , and we 're back to another one .
What do we do ?
That 's the future we 're going to use .
So now I 'm clearly very clear that we 're going to choose to be more clean , much more sustainable than ours -- we have that gas .
And look at the <unk> of the world , <unk> <unk> , and it 's basically a regular <unk> every day .
And they consume <unk> million dollars .
There 's a hundred billion dollars circulating by <unk> countries .
It 's absolutely impossible to do it .
If we look at the cost of <unk> , 50 billion dollars from the study of the <unk> Foundation , since the year 2000 , we 're going to pay money for <unk> dollars .
This has two cost - cost .
This is human history from one organization to another organization .
It will continue .
And when you 're looking at what 's going on , you see here that there 's a plate here , and you look at this <unk> , which is coming from us , and it 's the Middle East .
And based on this , we found that we 're the world 's world .
So what do we do with this world ?
I know how we do it .
I 'm going to bet that you will not have more than 10 percent of the people around the world .
If you know that , raise your hand .
There 's 12 .
There 's another 11 - year portrait in China .
Why do we have 11 engines ?
Can we do it ?
Are we smarter than others ? I do n't think so .
And so we look at where these cameras are in the slide , and there are five red places on this slide running out of the East .
<unk> is actually sending out the past , and these are <unk> .
So actually , we have 11 most of our 11 people in the Middle East .
Why ? Why is it in the Middle East ?
They need to be able to get rid of the road , and they 're going to keep the oil that can be bought .
One day in the United States , it 's about 25 million gallons of consumption per day .
And also the population of <unk> .
But it does n't have to be done .
That 's not the long term .
So what do we do ?
And so it goes on ?
Yeah , it 's still going to happen .
And we looked at this slide here , 1990 to <unk> .
And in this time , oil prices are going to die .
And to look at 70 percent of what we 're doing , 70 percent of what we 're doing .
So the people who have asked us to use the use of <unk> , let 's use our wind , use solar energy , as long as it 's the United States .
But if you have to deal with oil oil , you need to solve the issue of transportation .
So we 've been able to collect eight million volumes per day in the next day , 18 weeks per pound , five weeks from <unk> National <unk> .
And now we look at the largest oil countries in the world , and the second largest country , which we use 20 million acres of <unk> .
China is a little better plan or at least they have no plan .
We 've never seen any energy plan since the United States .
We do n't even recognize the resources we can use .
And if you look at the last 10 years , we have <unk> National <unk> .
If you take 10 years of <unk> , it 's going to be <unk> by 100 dollars per year .
This is not sustainable .
It 's the beginning of a cheap oil .
That 's the end .
<unk> National organization has already been known to let us say that Saudi Arabia is clearly clear that they have to sell their social commitment to <unk> .
My friend from Washington , D.C. , taught me , " <unk> people production for oil . "
We do n't do anything .
That means that no matter what they need to do , we have to pay . "
There is no Facebook price .
The oil prices are <unk> .
It 's a nation - state organizing oil supply .
So what do we do ?
We have to use gas .
<unk> can do it everything .
<unk> is 130 .
It 's about 25 percent .
It 's our rich <unk> .
They do n't need feathers .
It was 130 years since <unk> <unk> .
And then you can use <unk> .
It uses it very simple .
It 's easy to achieve .
You 're going to tell you a little bit about what you expect behind you .
But now you can look at this list .
<unk> is <unk> .
It can replace or <unk> as well .
It can use it to use its use of transportation , and it 's all about its advantage .
So we have enough gas .
Look at the <unk> on the left , and it 's 24 trillion .
That 's our first year .
If you look at the probability of <unk> , the <unk> estimates -- the industry is very clear to what you 're talking about -- and we have 40 trillion tons of gas .
How much more than the speed of <unk> ?
It will be <unk> in Saudi Arabia .
They claim they had 25 <unk> , and I do n't believe it .
I think maybe there 's a hundred billion cellphones .
But they do n't have a lot of gas .
So my <unk> is the use of gas .
And my goal is to <unk> .
Now we have <unk> trucks .
You can use these 18 balls of the truck with a truck -- to try to get that gas pressure , 30 percent of CO2 , which is also cheaper , and you can reduce it for three million gallons of oil .
So you can get rid of the <unk> truck , less than 60 percent of the oil oil .
There are five million <unk> across the U.S.
So that 's why the gas is fuel - fuel .
In my age , I do n't need to worry about gas flow .
This is the question you need to worry about .
But we have a really good flow of gas that 's going to be wind - fuel because it 's rich .
But as I said , nothing else in America would accept .
Now let me take you -- I used to be an ancient man , and I was a <unk> .
Now I 'm <unk> .
If you look around the world , there 's a <unk> of methane .
<unk> <unk> : So the methane is to use methane , so that it 's a very nice fuel gas plant , which is methane pollution , but if you decide that you 're going to work with methane as a energy energy , I do n't have to die .
So I think my argument is really clear that we 're going to use our own resources .
If it 's going to depend on a billion dollars per day .
We do n't have any energy plan .
So it did n't have me a little bit about the <unk> of energy , except for 18 years of a truck that I focused on .
And if we can do that , I think we 're going to start our energy plan .
If we could , we can see our own resources than anyone imagined .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
So from your point of view , you have a big plan for the wind , and you 've never heard of it , because the economy has changed .
What happened ?
<unk> : I lost 150 dollars .
And that makes us think about something .
And what we 're dealing with is , <unk> , in terms of terms , change our plan .
The profit is gas .
And we 're going to invest in wind , Alaska .
This is <unk> dollars .
You ca n't make gas for six dollars a barrel .
CA : So this is actually the price of the amount of ice that flows through the <unk> of technology , which is caused by the <unk> of <unk> ice .
And so that is that ?
<unk> : Yeah , that 's true .
And we found that water - <unk> technology could be used in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The first one is Texas , <unk> <unk> , and then the <unk> of New York , the temple in the New Yorker , West Virginia , in <unk> .
It 's everywhere .
It 's a lot of water .
CA : Now you 're a big entrepreneur and ready for the market ?
<unk> : You say , yes , it 's a big license .
This is my life .
And I was an <unk> , and I had my lifetime since school .
Now I have my own <unk> .
But I 'm not a big ecologist .
Somebody else says that I 'm the second big drive drive .
And I hope it is .
But I 'm not just talking about <unk> .
And I 'm also driving the fuel industry .
CA : But flow is fossil fuels .
You 're burning it . You released the <unk> .
Because you believe climate change .
Why do n't you worry about it ?
<unk> : But you have to burn some stuff .
What can you have ?
CA : No , no , arguments is the fuel emissions in our future because of the power of <unk> , right ?
And so based on this , you 're at least <unk> from coal or oil to gas .
But if it 's only because of that , because that 's why it does n't help invest in investing , is n't it ?
<unk> : I 'll give you Jim , and I 'm going to talk to him about how I have a conversation .
And he said that it 's going to be in the future of the future .
And then I asked us what 's going on .
Where is our goal ?
As I said , I do n't worry about this problem .
This should be a problem for you .
CA : But I do n't think it 's right .
I think you 're a member of a new model .
You 've got the money you need .
You 're a huge amount of people who are going to influence the difference .
How do you support the uses of carbon ?
Do you think that meaningful ?
<unk> : I do n't like the government because it 's government .
I can tell you that this must be <unk> .
The government does n't really succeed .
They do n't do that .
Look at the <unk> solar company , or whatever .
I mean , it 's permanently being a bad idea .
That turns out to be about five billion dollars .
I think it 's a billion dollars .
But Chris , I think it can be done in long periods of time .
I can tell you what they 're going to do about five years of paper , what 's called it .
First , do n't make <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
Secondly , do n't make <unk> on the ocean .
And so I think that <unk> <unk> is safe .
<unk> them up to the land , building the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> does n't make any mistakes .
We have to have power , that 's certainly it .
There 's no way of doing that .
CA : And there 's a question that audiences come up with , and how do you have a <unk> problem in the development of <unk> and gas and corn ?
Do n't you worry ?
<unk> : Yeah ? What is <unk> ?
CA : Yves .
<unk> : <unk> .
CA : You know we 're not quite glamorous .
<unk> : I 've told you that I have a lot .
I graduated from school .
I was playing with the first time for <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> technology , in 1947 , I was very upset about the president of the September of September , and we were able to say that <unk> <unk> was invented by 30 years ago .
I did n't know what he was in .
I 'm really concerned about that , which is that <unk> does n't know what is <unk> .
The first time , the first water was in 1947 .
My first job was in 1953 .
My life has been <unk> over 300 feet of <unk> .
There 's never been a problem before any problem , or whatever .
Now the largest carnivorous <unk> in North America , in <unk> , from the <unk> of Texas , the state of <unk> <unk> is <unk> by eight percent of the world 's life , and it 's called " <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> in <unk> , Texas , and the Grand Canyon , has already been over 80 million people in the process of <unk> .
There was no problem .
I do n't understand why media is focused on the eastern coast .
CA : Okay , so you do n't support any <unk> or anything like that .
And from your blueprint , I guess , is the world end up to get rid of the fossil fuels , which means that we have a day that one day will develop the sun and the <unk> to the cost of <unk> .
<unk> : Jim and I are only 13 years old .
It 's very small because it does n't reliable .
CA : So how do the world get rid of the fossil fuels ?
<unk> : How do we get out ?
We have a rich gas metabolism , and you 're not going to do a day of <unk> fossil fuels .
It will always be the most clean .
Look at California , they have <unk> .
There 's been a quarter of the gas supply cables , and we have about 25 years since the transit automotive .
Yves transit is already about 25 years since now .
Why ? <unk> air is the reason they use gas .
Why do n't you all have gas in China ?
Same deal for maintaining air quality .
I understand what you 're presenting to me and I 'm not anti - <unk> .
How do we get rid of corn ?
And that 's what I answered .
CA : All right .
And this is the question that you 're dealing with in the audience .
If someone find you and ask you a little bit about the solution to the solutions that you 're going to invest in , even if it 's not very capitalized , it might be the biggest benefit of the Earth .
<unk> : I 've lost a billion million dollars in ice .
So , of course , I 'm going to invest in that .
That 's why I 've been trying to try and solve the U.S. energy problem .
Just as anyone in the United States , I thought I would agree .
CA : Thank you so much , I 'm very grateful to come to this talk .
I think many people want to communicate .
It 's really unsatisfactory .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
The <unk> of the Internet Foundation is frequently called <unk> , but the founder of China , the Chinese company , thinks that it 's much more like a building building industrial .
<unk> , business , entrepreneur , history , innovation , invention , technology , web
<unk>
<unk> <unk> on the future of innovation
<unk> and <unk> , it 's easy to think .
And I know you 'll see other speakers , and they 're going to talk about bones , of course .
<unk> , technology is easy to adapt .
And if we look at what 's going on in the last six months , it 's really hard to think that even if you 've got this simple analogy of thinking about it .
And a lot of times , how do we respond to the way that things are trying to make things that we stored in things and things to do things .
So I think that if you can find an image of a <unk> , it 's just the beginning of the Internet , which is the first one .
And this analogy is really easy to understand the other <unk> of other <unk> .
First of all , the Internet bubble is essentially happening .
In the <unk> of <unk> , people are about seven billion dollars from California .
And also the Internet is completely real , and it provides a way to communicate the way people communicate .
A huge <unk> , huge leopard , a huge amount of <unk> , a huge <unk> .
And then you think , you know , there 's a lot of noise through the propaganda .
You do n't have to say that all of you remember the web of the Web , like <unk> , for 20 pages of <unk> .
Let 's look at the <unk> , and it 's exactly the same thing . "
In the <unk> of <unk> - <unk> , the king of <unk> in <unk> .
Some people have five , others have more .
Some of you would have 10 million dollars .
And people read this , and they 're really excited about this .
This is the <unk> of <unk> , California .
The opposite of <unk> and the Internet is still clear .
There 's no job on his work .
And then I went to <unk> .
People in the East coast , in <unk> , when they first heard about it , " No . "
They 've heard a lot about it until 1879 until 1850 , but they do n't believe it .
And in about two years they thought , " I 'm the most <unk> person in the world , how do n't you go to California ? "
And of course , these are the ones who are <unk> .
So local communities in East Asia together join 10 to 20 people in the United States , and they will build companies .
These people are obviously not individual force , but whether it 's lawyers or bankers , they do n't have their work , whether they have the skills , all the way up to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to <unk> .
This guy on the left , Richard <unk> , who was born in Philadelphia , he was walking in the temple , and he was the microwave lanes .
And they 're going to come up with the pyramids of the pyramids , crossing the pyramids , crossing the wetlands and then transfer the other boat to the other .
This is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to California .
They have <unk> , and they 're all doctors and <unk> .
They were successful at a surgical treadmill , a surgery .
We look at the Internet , and we 've got a <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , people are <unk> from the boat .
And in San Diego , most of the time brought out 600 ships because the <unk> came there , and they got rid of it .
There was just a six - year - old <unk> and 600 ship .
And then the boat becomes a hotel , because none of them could n't do it .
And if you have a passionate commitment to the Web , we have a lot of <unk> .
And you can see that this is a little bit <unk> when the Internet hits , and the same thing happens .
<unk> of San Francisco had 130 seals .
Half of the people went to <unk> .
It does n't make any half of the day to find them because they worry about these soldiers .
One of the guards wrote this : I struggle in this kind of <unk> , where I was doing the right thing to do , six dollars a month , 75 dollars per day .
<unk> consumption is very serious , very severe .
This is one of the images from <unk> <unk> , where it 's called " <unk> . "
People put their toes and their hands .
But they did n't plan .
They do n't know how far they 're going to go and get a lot of stuff .
It turns out that most of the <unk> and horses and <unk> are dead in the way .
That road was called " <unk> <unk> . "
In Canada , the upper sides of the corner : the lower sides fell in the <unk> , and there 's also a <unk> <unk> on the cliff , but even <unk> and all of these leopard <unk> before , they 're looking at a lot of people who are trying to find a huge amount of goods at the end of their day , when you 've got the fact that the truth is , it 's going to be so many of us who do n't have the opportunity to do that , so I have to say
These are animals who are <unk> , and they 're <unk> by the side of the road .
The opposite of this path is the experience of the <unk> and the pain , the weak experience , the <unk> , the purity of <unk> .
It does n't have those <unk> candy , but the Internet happens .
I 'm going to show you one of these , and you 'll see what I mean right .
This is the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> in 2000 .
<unk> : You say you have a lot of chosen inviting . The administrators : it 's true .
Two weeks : why would she have me ?
<unk> : Some of the stuff that will cause -- you 've got to show me , <unk> !
<unk> : It 's probably important for you . One party : Is that your wife ?
Two husband : 15 minutes . Tell : Oh , that 's your <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , life is a big thing , <unk> it around the world .
It 's hard to say this ad .
But this company spent 350 million dollars in the year 2000 , and even at the time , it was about 100 dollars per year .
In this case , we 've got the Internet ice cream , and the analogy that we 're going to have is not that it 's not a big deal .
In <unk> , when it ended up , everything ends up .
There 's a guy who says , " In <unk> , there are a lot of people who are deeply obsessed with <unk> .
They 've got over tens of thousands of years , and they 've spent a lot of money on health , health care and wealth and money in the middle of the day , where they do n't have the good expectations , but when they 're real , they found nothing to do . "
And of course , this is a very normal story .
Because when you put the last gold ticket , it 's a very short time , I mean , if you look at the <unk> of <unk> -- the entire river of the river , in less than two years of time -- and then people are <unk> every single rock , and so there 's only these big companies that are able to do it at a big scale .
And also , there 's a good analogy for you , and it 's really optimistic that you 're making industrial engineering .
There is a lot of similarities building industrial and Internet .
<unk> is the region of the industrial industry , and , of course , it 's not the same thing as the Internet , but what it does is that different industries is a lot of different industries .
This is n't a unique thing .
But the use of electricity is very broad , so you have to <unk> it out .
It can also be <unk> as an alternative source of energy .
It can even promote cooperative partners in a very elaborate way .
There 's a range of things about electricity .
And what I 'm looking at is the power of the <unk> device that 's called " <unk> . "
<unk> the entire world , the most significant instrument of <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> the world is connected by wires .
When people look at wires , they do n't think about other <unk> .
You know , people are looking at it -- people do n't think it 's going to leave the wire to the house , but it <unk> the lights on the left .
People do with electricity -- but it took a long time .
On the middle -- as you expected -- enormous capital to build this <unk> network network .
All the streets are <unk> .
This picture is shown here in the next Manhattan <unk> , building the first <unk> .
They have all the streets .
Thomas Edison , after <unk> , came back to prostitution , and it was a very expensive destination , which is really expensive .
But this is n't the most similar place for the Internet .
Because , the Web is based on all of these big structures , and these structures are highly beneficial for long distances .
So all of the cables and all the structures of those <unk> -- I 've just told you , in 1994 , it 's a part of a lot of <unk> .
In 1994 , how how did the Internet get growth for a year , and it does n't have a <unk> investment ?
Indeed , it 's because of these <unk> , big infrastructure .
And the <unk> of light has led to the participation of <unk> , which is the beginning of the <unk> .
And of course , this number is very large . First <unk> is <unk> -- this photo is invented in <unk> .
These <unk> , the <unk> of these devices , <unk> -- of course , depending on how you measure it -- about 40 to 60 years . This is a long time .
It 's about a big success , and it 's a huge success .
<unk> , very successful .
By the way , this is the beginning of the <unk> struggle .
And in that <unk> , the <unk> had <unk> .
This is the first time that <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> 's company , produced by the end of the Cold War , and the 92 <unk> needs two people to operate and have a car .
So it 's not really good .
This is the first time in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And just three years later , it was 1908 , and its weight sank 40 pounds .
Not all of you are successful .
This is a <unk> <unk> , and it 's not glamorous .
And I guess people would n't carry their <unk> .
This is not uncommon : shoes is a big <unk> <unk> .
It looks like six different colors .
And I do n't know why this is , but you might think that it 's not a lot of time when you think about it , and that 's probably the best time for innovation .
So we can put a ads , and we 'll play it on giant <unk> .
And we need to be right , and I think -- -- I do n't think that 's going to happen .
It 's been a huge amount of time , because people are normally doing a lot of time in the electromagnetic field .
And what I want to suggest is that you should know what this is .
People were n't invented .
And remember , people are not using electricity .
They 're on the lights , so you can put your toes on it .
There 's a light bulb in each room , in every room , in each room .
So you can just put light into it .
If you have n't seen <unk> <unk> , you 've got to see this . These are connected wires .
All the tiles are all over here , and what you need to do is to make your light glasses so you can use other <unk> .
So the next example is very successful .
This is all <unk> and desire .
Everybody wants a license machine .
The one on the left is <unk> .
There 's one <unk> , a <unk> engine .
It will clean your clothing .
This is clean water . From here , you can take the laundry out here and put your clothing out .
This is an amazing device .
You put it in your mailbox , because it 's a bit <unk> , and it 's <unk> .
You have to make a long panel of wires to your house , so you can put it on top .
And this is actually a very important thing to tell you , because they did n't invent the switch .
It 's a little bit more about the power of the skin , because people think it does n't mean anything .
I mean , people do n't want to have anything to do with it .
And when people do n't want to use light , they 're going to <unk> it .
This is what people do , actually , did n't turn it out .
And as I told you , people did n't invent <unk> , so the washing machine was a dangerous device .
And in fact , when you studied these things , you 'll find a few scary words , like people would n't be careful with their elbow and clothing .
And you ca n't stop it immediately because it 's surgically labeled with the light bulb .
And there 's nothing wrong with the machine , so it 's not bad .
And you might think that we 're not very comfortable with the <unk> that people are going to get into the light bulb .
But before I talked about <unk> , I think I 'm going to show you this : This is my conference .
This is absolutely an <unk> <unk> computer .
First of all , it 's self - <unk> . This lamp is always going down , so I put it on top of it .
I do n't always have wire wires , but it 's not the worst .
This is underneath my desk .
That 's me two days ago .
Indeed , we did n't have a lot of progress since <unk> .
It 's a <unk> .
And I think the future will be better , but you 're not trying to figure out your body .
I think you 're going to try and get it very hard .
And some of the founders of <unk> that I know is that this process is very , very <unk> , absolutely <unk> people .
Well , you 're in your house .
Take the number of users on your house .
The engineers do n't do this every day .
And they have to have a memory for three times .
One of my friends once told me that a story is not only about the employees , and then they 're waiting for the engineers to come up and get the third , engineers have to call them <unk> .
And those who are happy , because the engineers have a telephone call , and they 're waiting for the other hour to communicate and tell them to come up with the code until they get to this code .
We actually own ourselves as a <unk> .
By the way , <unk> is <unk> .
That means that <unk> design is not designed for the Internet , and this is the whole thing , we 're very primitive , that 's the point .
Because , you know , <unk> -- if you look at it as an <unk> and you 're very frustrated , because the last gold myth will disappear .
But what 's going to be really happy is , by innovation , it will be <unk> by innovation .
It creates two new kinds of problems , both of the new opportunities .
So if you believe that , then you can feel that we 're in the situation , and that 's what I like to do : I love this kind of thing . I do n't even mention the Internet , so I have n't talked about Internet users , but in fact , there 's a lot of <unk> <unk> , which is very , very scary .
This is our situation now . We do n't have the hair on the washing of the machine , but that 's what we 're in in the <unk> .
<unk> back to 1908 .
If you believe that I say that you 're not going to leave you . This is an issue in 1996 : " All the negative news causes us to think about the solutions of the Web . "
E : " Amazon like the Amazon , " but in 1999 , the rain is bombs . "
My mother did n't like this photo .
But if you really think about it , it 's just beginning to start with the Internet , so you 're going to do it in 1908 , and you 'll just want to figure it out .
And I believe that , in the future , we can create a lot of innovation that we 've done .
In <unk> , I hope you should n't make it .
This is a <unk> ad in <unk> .
And it goes on , " Do n't just raise the light . "
I think that 's what we 're faced with .
We 're very , very short . Thank you .
<unk>
Robert <unk> shows why we 're not responsible for the golden laws of " <unk> " because we sometimes forget it , and why there 's hope in the future , we might have compassion to exercise it .
charter , for instance , compassion , evolution , global issues
<unk>
Robert <unk> : The evolution of compassion
I 'm going to talk about compassion and magic physics from a way of non - religious ways .
I 'm going to try to tell you a little bit about the natural history of compassion .
So , when I have a little bit of <unk> language , it might not sound glamorous and stupid , like you heard about compassion .
I want to remind you that .
So I 'd like to say , first , I think , compassion is great .
<unk> magic is great . I 'm very glamorous .
And I think the religious leaders in the world , the <unk> of compassion , is the foundation of their faith , as well as the foundation of their faith .
And I think that religion is not the Internet .
I think it 's a good thing to do .
And what I 'm going to talk about tonight is compassion and magic , which is part of the nature of nature .
All right . But I think once you understand that they 're a part of the nature of nature , you 'll recognize that compassion is just enough to admit compassion , and that is enough .
There 's a lot of work . Okay .
All right . So quickly , quickly . First , compassion .
At the first time , it came to compassion , and I mean , that 's not just human beings , in fact .
And I think this might be this , in the world of evolution , even further , to love compassion , compassion and compassion .
It 's made from the principle of <unk> options .
The basic idea of choice is , if a animal feels compassion , and this compassion helps this animal to help this fight , eventually , this compassion is actually going to help that gene in this way , and it 's actually in fact that the gene does n't have to have this gene to do it in front of this <unk> , right ?
So , from a <unk> perspective , compassion is actually a gene that helps it . Okay .
I remind you that you 're not going to be glamorous and refreshing . Okay .
I continue . I 'd like to say a little bit about that .
And for me that 's not -- it does n't feel like I think it 's so difficult that Darwin 's compassion is in the order of <unk> .
In fact , I think bad news is about <unk> options , just to just say that this compassion is just going to spread in families .
That 's bad news . The good news is that compassion is natural .
The bad news is that the compassion of the <unk> <unk> is essentially nature 's <unk> .
Now , there 's more news to evolve in the evolution of evolution .
And biologists call that <unk> . Okay .
And the idea of <unk> is compassion that compassion is going to be good for you .
Again , you know that it 's not like the idea of compassion that you 've heard of the past , but from a biologist from a biologist .
That 's not what people feel compassion .
It was n't a conscious service for self - service , but it was his logic .
So , you 're most easy to have compassion with your friends and cousins .
And I 'm sure most of you , when a friend of a continuous friends , you feel bad .
But if you 're looking at a newspaper in the newspaper , you do n't know what happens when you 've never seen anything . OK .
That 's just human nature .
So , this is another story of the other good news .
The good news is that compassion is beyond the <unk> of evolution .
The bad news is that it 's not glamorous for us .
So , there 's the job .
Now , this leads to another consequence , and I think it 's a good news , which is a very good message for human species , right , changing the gold laws .
I mean , I do n't say that the <unk> laws are part of the gene , but you can go to a CFO , without religious philosophy , and then you 'll find , if you spend time with these people , they 're very , very good to get a good job , to make a bad job .
And the evolution of evolution thinks that these traits have foundation .
So they understand that if you 're ready to be good , you should be really good for people .
And it 's good to others .
That 's exactly what it is .
So , that 's good news . Now , if you look at it , you might be wondering what bad bad news is , OK , which is that we do n't have <unk> love , because , despite the understanding of natural laws , it 's also natural , but it is very Nature .
I mean , we do n't have anybody in the middle , and maybe we want to go to jail , but we suddenly think there are people who deserve to die in prison . Right ?
So , we think we should do something different than us .
Now , we 're a really big one .
We said they did bad things so they should go into prison .
We do n't have the real expansion of what we 're going to get in the world , and it 's going to increase the matrix .
And we have this ability to paint this in a special category .
And the problem is , although it 's going to go into the prison , you have a neutral judge , and you know , that 's the gold standard in every day , where we 've made a better decision on the Golden Rule , we make a much more <unk> and prepared equation .
And it 's basically , if you 're my enemy . If you are n't my friends , I 'm going to be a little more <unk> , and I 'll give you a less <unk> rule . OK .
We 're all doing this , and you can see the whole world .
You know , you look at the Middle East , and people who come from the East are participating in Israel .
They do n't want to give them the missile , but they say , " Well , the Israeli or some Israel , or a bit of Israel . "
And Israel does n't want to drink them , but they want <unk> , and they say , " That , the Palestinian , or some Jews . "
So , these are the golden laws of these <unk> that have a lot of problems .
And they 're very natural .
So , in some way , the <unk> is the fact that the truth is that it can not give us the love of <unk> .
It does n't save the world .
Now , I have a good news to save the world . Okay .
Are you nervous now ?
All right , because I 'm telling you that the good news is that I have to have an urgency .
So I hope I 've got the attention of what you can save the world .
It 's a clock that you just heard of .
This is just a rapid tale of the game .
It does n't make fun . OK .
This is about zero versus <unk> and <unk> .
And if you ask what 's going to be a friend of the friends and the <unk> , the answer is not zero sum .
If you ask what 's appropriate for people to define the enemy , it 's zero sum . Okay .
So , what does this mean ?
Basically , unlike the football game , there are <unk> and astronomers and reptiles .
So , they 've got zero .
So , in the face of a football game , it 's a bad thing to do for you , or for the other person who are bad , for those people who 're bad .
And look , you 've got zero . That 's zero to zero play .
Now , if you 're playing <unk> , you do n't have the zero sum of relationship with you , because it 's not good for you . Because the positive , it is a bad thing , right .
That 's not a zero - sum game .
So there 's a lot of play between the real world .
In the economic sphere , for example , if you buy stuff , it means that you 're not going to lose the goods , but the reputation does n't want to be a cop .
Both of you are <unk> . All right .
In war , two <unk> are about zero and zero .
That 's what they 're going to be like .
So there 's a lot of non - zero <unk> of <unk> .
So you can basically <unk> the form of what I said about compassion and the Golden Rule , and it 's just the nature of compassion , so that compassion is the most natural thing that people tend to think of as their friends , or their <unk> , as a potential relationship .
It 's the most natural thing that happens in the <unk> of these <unk> and <unk> .
So , <unk> and <unk> are you expecting compassion to express the magic of compassion .
Zero versus <unk> , you expect other things .
Okay . So now you 've got to hear the good news for me that might save the world .
Now I can admit that it does n't have to save the world , now I 've made you notice for three minutes .
But it 's possible , and the good news is that the history of history has been driven by non - zero and <unk> networks that can be compassion .
You can always go back to <unk> , and then I think , from technology revolution , the road , to write , a lot of transportation and communication , which is much more <unk> and connected to more non - zero and <unk> relationships .
That 's something that makes the story .
This is why social organizations have developed the ancient <unk> of ancient villages , <unk> , and now we 're in the world .
The story of globalization is a big non - zero story story .
You might have heard of each other 's word for this word , which is that it 's not just a zero sum .
If you raise your fate and another person 's fate , you 're not talking about the relationship between those people .
And you can always see this relationship on the world .
You can see that there 's a lot of bad things in the recent financial crisis , which is bad for everybody , for everyone .
It 's good . This is good for the world .
And you know , I 'm happy to say that I think there is evidence that this <unk> and the relationship can expand .
I mean , if you look at the American experience of Japanese in the United States , in World War II , it 's not enough to see the truth for Japanese media in America , and see what we 're missing is that we 've lost the fact that a lot of things are dependent on a kind of relationship . But you do n't think that part of it is dependent with an economy .
Anything that is dependent on each other , <unk> and relationships to understand people 's humanity .
So , I think that 's good .
And the world is very non - processed .
The environment , in many ways , put us into the same boat .
And there are some non - zero relationships that people do n't notice .
OK , so , for example , maybe many of the American Christians do n't think they 're going to be in the world , not zero , but they are really , because if Muslims are happier , it 's a good thing to think that they have a place in their place , and it feels good for the United States .
If Muslims are more happy , it 's bad for the American people . OK .
So there 's a lot of <unk> .
So , the question is : If there 's so much non - zero or zero zero , why do n't you have love , peace and understanding ?
And the answer is complex . It might be able to make the entire talk .
But of course , some of the things that are , first of all , have a lot of <unk> in the world .
And you know , sometimes they ca n't recognize the non - zero and environmental dynamic of the world .
And I think , in these two areas , I want the politicians to play a role .
It 's not just about religion .
I think the politicians can help create the relationship between <unk> and the <unk> of the economy , and it 's much better than that , I think , at least as far as possible .
And the politicians have to notice , when people look around the world , they 're actually looking at what they call the country , and they find clues to the other countries , who are zero or <unk> , or the relationship between the United States , for example , is the same thing that people do n't get to use ?
Because other people do n't fight you , from history , in the history of <unk> , or building other relationships .
So , we have to notice what signals are .
Some of the signals that are kind of like a political realm .
Let me remind you what you 're going to do , whether it 's the politicians or the religious leaders , the only way to expand our moral imagination , as you understand in various situations .
This is in love , but it 's good for compassion , because it takes compassion .
We also have an intimate story that is : the vision of the human mind is human nature .
That 's a good news . But we normally have a lot of <unk> in the <unk> .
And once we 're going to make someone a little bit of the enemy , we ca n't understand their feelings .
The classic example is that the United States , the Jewish American Britannica in the world you see from the <unk> of the TV .
The average American people are <unk> to think about the moral practice of the other , which is that they interact with the Iranians .
If you tell Americans , the Iranians feel that Americans do n't fight them , and they 're afraid they hate Americans .
Anyone who does n't interfere with you , so they 're very upset about them ?
They 're going to be spontaneous , and it 's also the nature of nature .
As far as the Iranians , when they try to get rid of what they say , Muslims are <unk> Americans , and they do n't feel hard .
So it 's hard to improve people 's moral imagination in those non - human capacities .
But I think even harder , because it helps us understand .
If you want to get the number of <unk> in the mountain , it 's important to understand why they 're doing it .
And I think that 's good moral practice .
And I 'm going to argue again about religious leaders , because religious leadership is good to bring things to people , and also control the quality of the brain to change their ritual , changing their own ritual .
I mean religious leaders are acting with soul .
This is from the <unk> of God , which makes the world more powerful moral imagination , to recognize all of the people in many ways .
And I want to summarize the <unk> of things , from reality , to compassion , the gold laws and sympathy of sympathy and compassion .
But unfortunately , the development of their development is <unk> .
We need to take effort to change this .
And of course , that 's hard , but like God 's job , we 're going to do it . Thank you .
<unk>
Most people do n't have <unk> , but it 's very important for us to show us , well , a lot of <unk> for progress , and she shows why the best partners are not <unk> ; and the teams , the community , our relationship , how it helps people to recognize and empathize .
business , leadership
<unk>
<unk> : <unk> of courage .
In the 1950s , a great doctor in the 20th century , <unk> , she called the doctor <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is very unusual , because she 's a doctor in the ' 50s , and it 's very rare for the 20th century .
She was very , very glamorous , and she was one of the young ones in the Royal Academy of <unk> .
She 's very unusual , she 's going to get married after she married her <unk> , and she goes to her medical job .
She was very unusual because she was interested in a new <unk> of scientific interest for disease forms .
But for each scientist , she knows she 's going to get her , and she needs to figure her out and fix her .
And the problem that physicians have chosen is that <unk> cancer is rising .
And most of the diseases are related to poverty , but these are the ones who seem to look at the <unk> of a rich family .
Because she wondered , how do you explain this particular phenomenon ?
At the time , Sony was hard to work for her research .
And finally , she only received 1,000 pounds from <unk> <unk> .
That means she knows she 's only a chance to catch data .
She does n't know what to do .
This is a research research for a lot of data , so she asked all the things she could think about .
Have these kids eating <unk> ?
Have they ever drinking anything ?
Are they eating meat and <unk> ?
Are they using <unk> or <unk> <unk> ?
When did they start school ?
And when she did a research research , she came back , and only one obvious piece of data came out , that most scientists could n't imagine .
Two thirds of these women died of their lives , and their mother was pregnant when they died .
This discovery is a huge shock for serious purposes .
Ideas think that anything is safe , like a <unk> .
This is a huge amount of motivation for this idea , especially for the new technology of technology .
And for the doctors to think about it , it 's a huge motivator , because they 're not helping patients .
And yet , James Murray Gell - Mann shows her first discovery in <unk> magazine .
And people were excited about the fact that the Nobel Prize could not be able to go to learn what she would find , and she could n't find her data .
In fact , she does n't do that before .
In the last 25 years , the major majority of medicine in Britain -- the British and the American Revolution of the U.S. and American Medicine .
And the data is open , and it 's easy , but nobody wants to know that .
There 's a child in <unk> week , but it does n't happen .
<unk> ca n't change change .
25 years later , Ed Stewart is doing a lot of fighting .
So how did she know she was right ?
She had a <unk> model of thinking .
She was in a parallel collaboration with a <unk> called George <unk> , and George of George <unk> are <unk> .
Music is very glamorous and social , and George is a <unk> .
Women are passionate about her patient .
<unk> more , more digital , not people .
But he talked about the great benefits of their job .
And he said , " My job is that Dr. <unk> is wrong . "
He looked at false error .
<unk> her models , her data , and different ways to prove that she 's wrong .
And he 's putting his job as a theory of what 's called <unk> .
Because only he could n't prove that the speaker was wrong , and George Bush could have a <unk> confidence that she needed to believe she was right .
This is an incredible model of collaborative <unk> that <unk> each other .
I want to know how many people there are , or they have this kind of partnerships .
<unk> and George are very good at <unk>
They think this is the idea .
So what does this <unk> require ?
Well , first of all , it needs us to find very different people .
That means that we have to be mentally <unk> , that 's what we tend to do as people , and that means we need to find different sorts of backgrounds , different kinds of training , a different way of thinking and to think and think about them .
This need a lot of controversy .
I think the more you think , right , really , I feel like a love .
Because if you do n't care about it , you 're not going to get much energy .
That means that we have to be ready to change our thoughts .
And the daughter of the doctor 's daughter told me that every time a lawyer went to a colleague scientist , they made her thought .
" My mother , she said , " my mother does n't like shit , but she 's good . "
So this is one aspect of the relationship between <unk> .
But this brings me to the most challenging of the biggest challenges that we 've never seen , and most of them are not attracted by individuals , but it 's a lot of people who are much larger than the state , which has a huge amount of money in the country .
So how do these organizations think ?
In fact , they 're not thinking about it .
That 's not because they do n't want to be because they ca n't .
Because people in the tissue have an Olympic <unk> .
In Europe , in Europe and in the United States , there are <unk> people who are convinced that they 're not going to talk about what they will say .
There 's a lesson in which the <unk> that you do n't want to get into their <unk> , and they do n't know how to deal with it .
<unk> number big .
That means that most of the organizations are n't doing what 's going to be done by George <unk> .
They do n't have a single part of it .
And that means that many of the people who have a lot of <unk> for us are finding the best people they can find , but most of them fail .
So how do we nurture the skills that we need ?
Because it really needs some skill and practice .
If we do n't feel like <unk> , we have to be really good at thinking about it .
So , recently , I was working with a group called <unk> <unk> , who worked for a medical device company company .
He was worried that he was working on his work .
It 's really complex that this machine might have some mistakes to harm people .
And he was scared to harm who he wanted to help .
But he looked at people , and nobody seemed to have this fear .
So , he does n't want to say that .
After all , other people might know what he does n't know .
And so he would look stupid .
But he did n't worry about it , so he thought that the only thing he could do was to stop his job .
Finally , <unk> and I found a way of dealing with it .
And what happened was that it happened immediately .
And all of that have the same problem with <unk> .
So now <unk> and his partners , they can think of it .
And of course , there 's a lot of <unk> and arguments that allow everybody to be creative , to solve this device .
<unk> is a little bit like most of the <unk> that thinks that it 's like all of <unk> , he does n't have a passion for <unk> ; he has passion with his passion and for organization .
But he was too uncomfortable with his <unk> , until the last poem was worse .
And when he talked about his <unk> , he found a lot more than what he did .
And his colleague does n't feel like his idea .
They think he 's a leader .
So how do we get more and more into the conversation ?
Well , <unk> teaches it all the textbook students have to <unk> them , and they 're ready to be ready for the five of these statements .
And what 's important about these statements is that these are the things that they 're willing to do and have the ability to challenge the challenge .
And I think this is a system that 's a <unk> system , but I do n't think that you 're going to leave the college , and it 's too late .
I think that we should teach these skills so that children and adults are teaching them , if we want to think .
In fact , the biggest disaster we 've ever seen , which is rarely because of some hidden or secret information information .
It 's all made of <unk> information , but we 're not completely ignored because we do n't want to deal with the challenges and <unk> .
But when we 're willing to get rid of this sound , or we 've seen it , we have the best to think about us and the people around us .
<unk> information is a very important network .
But it does n't make us free unless we have skill , <unk> , talent , moral courage to use it .
It is n't ending .
It 's just a beginning .
<unk>
Stewart Brand has been working for millions of years of work , which is a clock for the next 10 years , and this project inspired us to think about the future of long - term challenges : that 's a very interesting question : Where does a million years ?
architecture , art , design , future , technology
<unk>
Stewart Brand on a million years
Welcome to <unk> ice .
So let me show you why we 're here , maybe you might have some of your hand .
I wrote a book called " The <unk> . "
This talk today is you can understand how to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : In the past decade , I 've been trying to decipher the culture , allowing us to have a long way of thinking about the way that we can think about it , rather than that , but not that hard , or in some cases , in certain circumstances .
If humans can be able to think about the meaning of <unk> thinking , it will be , now , not that week or <unk> , but the future of the past 10 years , the world 's time is going to go through the time .
The long foundation was on San Francisco .
It 's a series of projects that are focused on the project , and it 's all about thinking about <unk> .
And our core project is a very glamorous project that can say a <unk> <unk> project , and it 's a hundred million years old .
And the design of this project is really glamorous .
Okay , <unk> , and here 's all you 've seen here , so many of you have seen this .
This is the first tens of millions of years of <unk> that we 've done .
<unk> ft .
It 's designed by Danny <unk> and Alexander <unk> , and it 's in the Japanese museum in London .
So what 's the problem that we 're going to do today , and how do we make a stable <unk> like this , which allows you to be able to wrestle in a period of time in the year of a year ?
And this is the first idea .
So Alexander <unk> this idea of a series of <unk> <unk> .
And this idea seems well that when you think about a long - time period of damage to a building .
See , this is the destruction of the building .
This is <unk> <unk> , and it 's built almost two years since <unk> .
This is a very glamorous project that thinks that it can <unk> because they 're using giant <unk> .
This is just a little bit of a pile of <unk> , and nobody knows what it is .
This is the fate of the building , and they 're all <unk> .
Even the most conservative , <unk> buildings like <unk> , the pyramid of <unk> .
Yves <unk> took off the grave .
These buildings have been used for things , but they do n't have this effect .
So we thought , well , since the building is n't a bad solution , what is it that 's good for us ?
And at the bottom of the surface , what was the <unk> window ?
Find a very strong place .
And the answer is , obviously , we need to find a mountain .
And not just the mountains .
We need to be right in the right mountains , and that 's where we have a hundred million years old .
So we 've seen the problem with looking at the right place .
And based on <unk> , we think that it must be a mountains in the desert , and then we 're going to go to the United States of the States .
We looked at <unk> <unk> .
Look at the <unk> of Arizona .
And here , the <unk> of the National Hall Foundation found that we brought us to the most young countries in the United States , and the oldest National parks , which is <unk> National Park , that 's the state of <unk> Park .
And it 's in the border in the <unk> of the West .
This is the highest place in the entire state , and there 's <unk> feet tall .
And you see , on the left , it 's very <unk> , and there 's a very <unk> right on the right .
This place is very remote , and it 's about 200 miles from the nearest city .
There is no silver or <unk> .
There is only one in the United States called 50 trillion yards , which is the most <unk> road ever .
In this <unk> , on the right .
The green line is the National Guard forest .
On the left , the <unk> and other sorts of personal areas .
And in the middle , it 's a big <unk> of <unk> , and this <unk> region is the <unk> area , which is <unk> .
And thanks to Jay Walker and <unk> , they were here two today , and this is where we 're going to start this project in their support .
Okay , let 's look at some of what there is .
We 're on the top of the cliff , and it 's a cliff in the <unk> Sea , which is a high altitude of the <unk> .
These <unk> are shaped by density .
It 's about 2,000 feet thick , and it 's a bad choice .
And people have to go to the point where they 're going to come to a stage like a <unk> <unk> .
And last year , the board of the <unk> Foundation , a group of teams and donors , spent two weeks on the table , where they 're trying to understand whether it 's really appropriate , and what we can do about it ?
Danny Hillis was trying to solve this problem .
And he proposed a theory , explaining how to explain this mysterious process .
And he said , that process is seven .
One of the first things that happened was that the image of your mind is in your head , you think of yourself .
That 's the end of the journey , and it 's a <unk> .
And then it 's beginning , and this is the beginning of the <unk> of ordinary life .
And then it 's a very glamorous thing to go in .
And the idea is that a concept is to come out of a very difficult way , and you 're going to get even scared -- but you have to go to the past , if you get a certain <unk> .
And then you 're going to see something like the Grand Canyon , and Hamas you get out of the <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> Foundation -- this is a project that has spent two years of research in this project to make a CD called " <unk> , " which is about 10 years ago .
One of the components of this is based on a three - year - old algorithm that 's been created by the <unk> of <unk> , which is a hundred million years old , and they 're going to be able to draw a different series of <unk> per day in the next day of the year .
<unk> algorithms can achieve this .
We 'll hear it immediately .
" <unk> year . "
Let 's go back to the <unk> of the seven to the seven .
The <unk> is return , and it 's the most exciting time it is .
You go to places where you want to go .
<unk> says this is a great journey to have a mysterious <unk> .
That 's what you did .
That 's where you get .
You have to return back to the normal world , and you 're going to <unk> the things that you need to learn .
And then , if you should have a <unk> ? <unk> units .
In the end , there 's a physical object that you can take .
Maybe it 's a <unk> drill drill .
One is your own thing .
How do you study a mountain ?
This is not a normal building project .
How do you notice something ?
What is the biggest change in your mind ?
We start from the channel , and if you look at the left panel , there 's the National Hall park , which is one of the most sacred places on the right , the world 's <unk> rainforests .
It might be possible , but it had to be very careful .
The other things that need to be thinking about is the probability of the <unk> , the weather and the height of the temple .
It 's special to notice the tree . You look at some of the <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is covered with <unk> <unk> .
They are the oldest living creatures in the world .
People think they 're only so tall , but they 're not .
And the tree of that hill is the <unk> of the ice , and it 's grown up .
<unk> <unk> is so strong that it 's very strong , it has a long time .
If you 're on the coast of the mountain , some of you can go back and get a few hundred years later .
And those rocks are also beautiful because they 've got a hundred years of glasses .
<unk> on the trees of the harbor , they 're working with us .
Well , if you look at your hand , you can go through the hands , especially the bottom .
Very interesting .
And you can feel why it 's called <unk> , and you feel it .
And here 's the image of the dance <unk> , and it 's in the middle of this year , where I should talk about this species of ice , which is based on a theory of theory .
In the ' 80s , he was painting in <unk> , and he wrote a theory of these trees in the <unk> of the magazine of Science , in " <unk> <unk> . "
And he was starting to use this theory , which was research on the <unk> of the species , and found that this kind of <unk> is about 40 years in <unk> , looking at this type of brain .
" <unk> <unk> " is also an interesting principle of design .
OK , let 's look at the Russians . First of the first time in land , we 've been looking at a hundred - year - old , and there are two billion people who are able to buy 180 acres and some church .
Because the owner of the land says , " Well , there 's a billion people in the land .
We say , well , we can not buy them , do n't we stop ?
We 're an non - profit Foundation , and you can make a huge amount of money for us .
As long as you can prove that to the government , it 's a billion people .
And a few years later , there was a couple of years of help with <unk> and Jay , and we ended up selling this in 14 million dollars .
This is one of the gods in the mine .
It 's called <unk> <unk> , and there 's a little bit of a <unk> . That 's what it looks like .
And it 's a half - meter , and it goes down to the east and goes to Europe , to a very interesting place where we 're going to get out there and you 're looking at the <unk> , but it just looks like a <unk> .
<unk> is not very glamorous .
<unk> <unk> are n't required for any kind of <unk> tree .
And what <unk> is , is that some of you need to have a certain amount of money into the <unk> .
This is Ben <unk> , and he 's a Furby park in the country .
There 's a lot of weird stuff , like this organism growing up in a dark jar .
This is another one in the Arctic , and it goes back in the hills .
That 's the beginning of the land of a lot of California , which is beginning to start here , and it 's a social <unk> .
In fact , it 's the highest theme of <unk> <unk> in the world .
You can imagine how it 's going to work in a place where you 're in the Grand Canyon .
You might recognize some <unk> .
On the right hand side , there 's Paul <unk> on the left , and they 're looking for <unk> , and they ca n't find it .
They had jobs in the day , the last <unk> of mine .
It 's called <unk> , which is underneath the valley .
On the left , there 's a <unk> , and he 's looking at the people from the National Museum of Park and you have a mile in the world .
They found four species of bats .
Now , almost all of these <unk> are below the <unk> .
This is where we think .
They do n't have any progress .
And look at the weather . The weather is very special .
More fun than the Alps of September .
Last year in June , we were there .
You wake up on the top of the mountain .
And we went to the top of the hill , and we 're going to look at our climate and do it . It 's <unk> <unk> .
It 's also beautiful .
On the left - hand side , the <unk> of women is the area of <unk> , and she 's the region of the National Assembly Service , which allows us to use it .
We want to get a short land to use liberal liberal <unk> , which is a time for <unk> abuse .
It 's fun .
Yves <unk> and <unk> were designed a wireless <unk> .
Through solar power , data <unk> signals through <unk> , <unk> back into the <unk> of <unk> and data on the channel , and then <unk> data to the site and bring data into San Francisco .
So you can see the last week in the <unk> , California , the weather - on - <unk> ice <unk> .
Well , look at some ways to go there .
And the truth is , no <unk> can go to Washington , and there are only some old candidates like this , so it goes to any place where a place is going in the jungle .
But no bear , no <unk> tree , did n't have any people , because it was a long time .
You could n't get out of a few days .
Here is a path to a switch .
You 're going to come to Lincoln .
It 's a beautiful place , and it 's got a piece of panels around the bottom of the cliff , which is very easy to walk , but when you come here , you get a problem .
You can actually choose the <unk> , as a path to a road .
Another possibility is <unk> from the hills .
You can also understand why we call a long ice .
It 's very easy to stand up at the bottom of the ice , and it 's really straightforward in the area of <unk> and <unk> , which is by a <unk> in the area of <unk> feet .
And you can continue to go through the lawn to get out of the <unk> , to zero feet of ice , and there 's a problem here .
When I left the <unk> , we said , " Well , let 's say , " I 'm going to get older .
The more difficult they get , the more they <unk> it . "
Okay , so this is about 600 feet tall .
And the <unk> that Alexander <unk> wants to do is to start with <unk> , <unk> feet from the <unk> .
But what we know is that , to the higher distances , the power of people will fall down , but your emotions are really good for the <unk> , whether you 're willing to do it .
At the time , Danny Watson is still able to calculate the height of his brain that he could n't use .
And I came up with the <unk> , and when he came to the ceiling of the cliff , he said , " There 's a great V - old , I think I can get there . "
He 's going to tell you , but it 's also our project director .
I do n't want him to die because I knew he loved it .
I said , " You 're gon na be careful , Be careful . "
And so he came up with this , and I heard , " I 've got half of the distance , but I 'm in the corner of a dive . "
This is a piece of a secret channel , like <unk> <unk> .
And then I said , " Be careful , wait a minute , get you careful . "
And then I heard " I 've got to go on the top , and you can see the same thing . "
He 's on the top of the mountain .
See , that 's him .
And he 's the first one from the top of the helicopter to Washington , which is completely one person doing it .
This discovery has changed the way we think about those cliffs and what we do .
We found that there was something that needed to be found to the Alexander .
Is n't that fun ? No .
Finally we decided to call <unk> <unk> .
<unk> -- if you go to the Grand Canyon , there 's a very beautiful leopard , it 's called <unk> , which is called " <unk> . "
It 's really a hidden thing , and it does n't feel that you can find it .
When you look at the <unk> , you 'll see that this <unk> is going to be found .
One day , Danny and I came to the same place where Danny Hillis saw the ice on the right , looking at the fall of the cliff , and there was some <unk> , there 's a little bit of <unk> in it , if some of you have been looking for millions of years , they might be able to get out of it .
The people who want to be able to look at their <unk> , they look very little , and they 're on the air .
How do they go there ? Am I going to do that ?
That might be the <unk> of millions of years of <unk> and <unk> .
Here 's another angle of view , which is south of the South , and then you go to the north and see the entire <unk> .
You know , the dance of dance is to calibrate this moment of time , and it 's going to depend on the sun at the end of the road , which is so hot that it is a little bit of a solar pressure , so it can <unk> a sun that will break the time .
So even on Earth speed , it will still happen .
This is from south , from north and north , from the north .
This is the area of the deforestation , and if you go to the top of this cliff , you see the long - term Foundation in the forest .
If you look at it again , you 're going to feel " <unk> <unk> . "
This is a long - term vision . There are a hundred miles from the horizon .
This is actually the <unk> line , which is really <unk> .
It 's a very different place . There are high - speed feet tall .
And if you look at this image , especially the edge of the cliff , there 's 600 feet tall , and in the upper left - hand corner , the left leg is 600 ft , so he goes down to the <unk> of <unk> .
That 's what it looks like .
I think we should be there or something like that .
It 's much smaller than the ice of the ice .
Notice that it 's not a snow , it 's white .
And you can also see a very long <unk> .
These are from <unk> <unk> .
They 've got something good here , but it 's in the hard place .
Danny Hillis is looking at a answer to a design problem .
And he 's thinking that there 's a long - term foundation that looks at the bottom of the cliff , looking at the top of the ice .
Because the real ice is in a hidden corner .
We used to have that authority in the military .
And the answer to this question is that , from the deep sea , you can see that this is the <unk> mistake of the human mind .
So we 've got three design challenges here .
It 's about the experience of the ice .
The experience of <unk> is <unk> .
And the third thing is that the number of times the experience of the Gibraltar 's experience is completely <unk> in the ice , and the <unk> is <unk> behind the sea , but if you look at a place where you 're looking at the Grand Canyon , 15 miles away .
And you can see that in the large <unk> of the <unk> , it 's about swimming from the water .
And then you can still see <unk> <unk> .
One of the farm is called <unk> farms , and they 're going to tell you what 's going on .
There was beautiful there .
<unk> can see the footsteps of <unk> and cows , and it 's been run by Paul and <unk> , but they 're doing it .
There 's a lot of problems in the farm .
This is from a farm from the farm , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And if you go to the brink of kelp , how do you look at the ice ?
This is <unk> , and they 've lived in <unk> , thousands of years .
The long - term Foundation is thinking about whether it 's possible to buy the ice in the area , because that 10 corals include <unk> acres of ice -- 500 square square miles of land , and we think there 's a way to sell a hundred million dollars a year , <unk> it , to <unk> the size of the two hundred dollars , so that it can make a difference . That 's fantastic .
Okay , let 's look at this <unk> .
This is a process that <unk> for tens of millions of years to be able to get to people , but people are n't going to experience it .
In the bottom of the cliff , there 's a natural cave .
It 's only 12 feet deep , is n't it ?
You can go to sleep , go and keep it .
And you might find a <unk> that starts in the beginning , and then <unk> becomes more glamorous .
And this rock obviously has been taken by many people .
You 're going to end up in a lot of light , and you 're going to end up in a million years .
This is not a <unk> , and this is the foundation of the building , which is based on this <unk> structure , where you 're looking at it and your perception is <unk> outside the <unk> .
This kind of building art is a building that you do n't look at what you 're doing .
This is the wisdom of <unk> .
<unk> , the most glamorous , glamorous place , is funded by the mystery of mystery .
And what we do is we take a <unk> part of the <unk> , and we compare it to <unk> .
This is not a big <unk> clock , but it 's a clock who plays with <unk> .
The <unk> of indigenous peoples is that you need to think about the future of a long - term future .
The <unk> of indigenous peoples " <unk> " -- Welcome to <unk> .
Thank you .

The <unk> designer <unk> <unk> talks about a bunch of <unk> people -- from the ' 50s and ' 60s to <unk> him : " <unk> . " In his <unk> talk , he can find how happy the real life of happiness .

Ted <unk> on <unk> vs. creativity
I , like , Einstein , a little bit of view .
I 'm not going to sleep a lot . I 've slept with this thing as a big virtue , in a few years , because I think <unk> is terrible .
Now , I 'm going to really sit in a way that you 're sitting there , you know .
But for years , I sat down with a lot of <unk> , and I think about my creativity in a big way .
I <unk> lying down , and I think about all sorts of ideas , I 'm walking .
Sometimes , I used to be <unk> at night .
And in daytime , it 's a fun person to look at .
And sometimes -- in fact , the <unk> of the Wall Street Journal of <unk> pages , like looking at this man , -- and I 'm following his real question , and it 's a really good pair of shoes .
So I 'm following this guy .
And then she did this with his shoes , and the rest of the hand goes all the way .
And I 've always been this one .
In fact , I think a lot of my design comes from the wrong direction and the eyes .
Because I feel like , you know , there 's a lot of images everywhere around you .
These are the ones that make me interested in finding a little bit more wrong , and , of course , it 's very , very surprising .
And so often , I 've seen a hole in the <unk> , or something like something that looks like this , and it looks very interesting or better or it 's a good thing to do .
So I took the car off , and then I went walking and I found that there was no hole , but it was an optical illusion , you know .
And I thought , maybe there 's a hole here , and there are people who 've been thinking about this idea .
Somebody has made that wrong , so I ca n't do it again .
I do n't know where it comes from .
For me , it does n't come from research .
I do n't need to study my inspiration .
In fact , one of the best things that happened , I used to , in my entire life , was in New York , at Christmas .
I was in the perfect <unk> of the <unk> Britannica in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You know , I read it as an actor .
And I found this incredibly smart architect I loved .
This woman 's called <unk> <unk> , and one of my friends , she came to the grave and said , " Well , you know , Tony , that 's about three years .
I said , how could I possibly be <unk> ?
And I know that a chicken and a bird , you know , he gets rid of the birds , and then you heard you 've heard about it , or you hear birds .
So I 'm not very aware of that , really clearly -- actually I 'll do my own special research , you know .
If I do that for 18 centuries of the 18th century or something , I 'm going to do lots of research , because it 's not because I should do it .
<unk> , especially , particularly <unk> my inspiration .
The color of the film , the light of light , comes from the lights behind the monitor , or from its light on the floor , and it 's going to look like this .
Anyway , let 's look at this little little video and show you .
I sat on the film at night , and I 've seen the women in the movie .
And I would think , you know , their role , as you 've got to try to see the film looking at your daughter .
Because I always look at a way of looking at women .
Whether it is to celebrate them , or you know , it 's a spell that 's irony to them -- or they 've seen , in some way , there 's something called a <unk> or a <unk> .
I 'll never go back to color .
The color is very glamorous .
I 'm very difficult to find color in the natural world , even though , you know , with the colors of the <unk> and the color .
So that 's what I did . I made a lot of research for color .
But most of the time , I think , how could I make a beautiful thing like <unk> <unk> ?
How do I make <unk> so beautiful ?
I mean , that 's impossible , you know .
So that 's why I 've never slept at night , I think , you know .
I want to show you -- I 'd like to give you a big -- and I 'm often going to find the <unk> and <unk> , which is the other thing that inspired me .
People say , ooh , do that . And tell me what to do .
So I did .
When I was 21 years old , a leopard told me that I would meet <unk> , and his name would be the Grand Canyon , right ?
So , you know , a couple of years I have to come up with the <unk> , and I 've got anyone who 's going to get <unk> or whatever .
Sometimes I was actually struggling , and I would say , you know , walk into a hotel and say " <unk> . "
And the people who come back look down , I 'll just walk down the past .
And a long time ago , I had this kind of fun experience for a long period of time .
And what he ended up with is a shot of my fate , the <unk> of a <unk> , and the black man on the left , like an <unk> poet .
I think you 're going to show you a film because I 'm doing something like this .
Just look at it .
<unk> .
: Thank you , we can do everything you ask .
And the title of this show is from this story , which is about my mom .
And from a certain point from what she said .
That was when I was on a date .
It 's just because I 'm so happy with him , I swear .
And I got close with him about a year .
We 're very excited about each other , so we decided to bring our parents together .
And we 're going to tell you about each other .
My mother was a little sensitive to his mother . His mother had an opinion on his life .
You know it 's <unk> .
So my mother was <unk> . She turned back to her , and she said , " Are you kidding ? They 're born one .
And they 're going to eat it together . They 're doing it . "
They 're going to eat it together . They do it together .
This is the name of the show . They 're going to eat , and they -- I 'll die after my <unk> .
" He 's going to eat it . Go to the show . "
When I was on this film , I did n't have a lot of paper to sing at the <unk> 's song in my shirt .
So you probably have to look at my show .
Because a little bit of <unk> , like ...
I do n't know how to describe this .
And the more I feel , I think , is good .
At least for me , because , if I 've always been doing this , I do n't know , and I 'm very , very boring . I am very depressed .
I 'm not saying I can make anything . I just say I 'll do a lot of things .
I 'm going to try and do n't look at anything before .
And I think , I guess I do n't sleep every night .
Like , look at the <unk> and think , you make yourself so crazy .
But I think that 's true , right ?
Because if you do a lot of things , you 're bad for everybody , but not only one .
You 're not going to be a mathematician .
Yeah , it 's true .
And I 'm going to show you that , I 'm going to show you that opera .
I have a lot of different sorts of <unk> .
Like the Grand Canyon , a lot of <unk> , many of the gossiping with Mark <unk> consultants , and he 's one of my best friends .
And I designed with him . This is , recently , <unk> , " <unk> . "
I was a teenager in the world of romantic romantic world .
When I read the <unk> art , I was a actor .
Most of my friends are the ones .
And that 's where I came from .
I do n't know where it comes from .
I 'm a kid when I was a child .
Maybe that 's where I 'm inspired .
And then the <unk> high school .
At the time I was in high school , I saw some of the romantic dancers .
You do n't know how to design it from that point .
And I went to the <unk> Design Foundation , and I started my art career .
I do n't think I 'm a designer . I ca n't believe myself as an actor .
I do n't know what to call me .
I thought I 'd be ... I do n't know what I was doing .
That 's it .
But I have to say a little bit about it , and I think it 's a very important thing to think about scale designers .
You should be a little bit boring .
If you 're not , it 's a little bit boring .
But I really felt a little bit boring .
I always say to my work -- Mary <unk> , she 's going to get all the stuff -- she <unk> all of the things she can do .
All of the business is running .
I always told her , I found that I spent a lot of time on the computer .
I spent time on computers , like , too -- no , I think the world 's most boring place is a television center , and it 's going to be a TV center in the middle of a day .
Because all of the things I like to do , it 's all in place .
And if you think about it , you can go and see other things . Right ?
So I did this television .
That 's a very , very important part of my career , especially .
In fact , do n't you ? Thank you .
This is one of my favorite favorites in my country .
Isaac <unk> : We go back to live .
Hey , guys .
<unk> : Hey , Ben .
JH : And look at how wonderful she was .
<unk> : She said , " <unk> ! "
JH : Ah , Doc , ooh , <unk> . OK , what am I going to sit here ?
I do n't want to be <unk> .
I do n't want -- okay , we start .
Are you nervous ? <unk> ?
<unk> : <unk> ?
<unk> .
Woman : <unk> ? No , never never .
I 've never seen it before .
It 's been cute .
Are you like you ? OK .
Do n't you just look cute ? You want it .
<unk> : And of course , I want to look beautiful .
JH : It 's just confusing because people want to look , <unk> .
<unk> : No , I 'm not .
JH : A few stories about the rich people who have kids , but these kids are very , very bad , and you know what I mean ?
There 's always a solution .
Because only because you 're glamorous , super - famous , that means you ca n't have kids in the end ? Because you know what they 're going to accomplish ?
<unk> : No , but that means you 're going to put them in the first one , I think .
But you need to make decisions .
My kids are about seven years old .
They 're not 14 years old .
Maybe they 'll watch this video , " I 'm a good man . "
Oh , this is one of my favorite ones .
JH : It looks good , right ?
A : I 'm talking about you . Your hair -- <unk> : No , it 's really good -- nuts .
JH : I do n't think that 's going to happen .
A : Oh , no , we 're going to step next step . <unk> : We 're <unk> .
: Are you afraid ? You 're too cute .
<unk> : No , I like this , this is a new one .
CA : Ooh , that 's great .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> !
So , it 's all very boring things .
I mean , it 's like putting some people who have been cute .
That 's not boring . This is n't boring , and what 's interesting about it ?
And I read a very good day , and I said , " <unk> people to feel fantastic because it makes you laugh . "
Right ? And then I found that it was my website , and it said , that 's what I said . And I thought , well , I 'm in a interview .
I forgot that I said that , but that 's true .
And I want to show you the last piece , and I 'm going to leave you with this film .
And I tell you that I 'm often <unk> ; I love taste .
I often have a lot of things to think about food .
For example , I said , " Oh , you 're going to take the <unk> off ?
How do you service the service ?
How do you wear a bad chicken ?
And I always connected food to the kitchen .
And I think that 's the final conclusion .
All the things came out of the food .
So look at this .
This is what I 've been doing , so I think that 's the most interesting thing to think about the world .
Like this website .
There 's a lot of different things .
A very fragile website .
We 've taken a lot of videos like television .
This is what I most like to do .
It 's about this year in February , and who knows .
Once again , I did n't say this is a good thing , and I just said it was n't boring .
This is the last one .
Video : Yeah , to tell you , I 'm always going to eat milk or lose milk .
<unk> : Right ?
JH : Yeah , but I never found a milk , never before .
Tim : Ooh .
<unk> : You ca n't find milk in <unk> . You do n't get it .
Lee : Do you find ?
BG : These are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : No , but that 's exactly what happens .
CA : All right .
<unk> : Ooh , do n't you ? I 'll tell you .
Tell you some interesting stuff .
CA : No , do n't laugh .
I know that no one 's not knowing anything about this .
Sorry , what do you say ?
<unk> : Okay , that 's what I 'm telling you .
At the time they did it , you know how to do it .
: <unk> ?
<unk> : <unk> ?
CA : Yeah .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> .
The fluid is essentially that pure fluid .
If you give <unk> to the head , it becomes <unk> .
That 's a long time to do that .
It can be used for nylon and everything .
Now , you 've got to buy <unk> milk , actually , or <unk> milk .
JH : Sorry , I did n't know , OK .
<unk> : And he thinks it 's too good for the milk .
<unk> : Yeah , yeah .
What about the <unk> ?
Okay , so thank you very much indeed . Thank you very much .
To TED , it 's great , I love this , and I love this .
Thank you , Goodbye .

Why do n't you have political developments in the political community where you ca n't live in places like <unk> ? <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of Islam , <unk> - <unk> -- the <unk> story of the world of <unk> and the global community , the powerful talks of global civilization -- a powerful conversation from TED 2011 .

<unk> <unk> : A global culture with <unk>
Have you ever wondered about why chop <unk> are very powerful in Muslims , especially in the past ?
Have you ever wondered about how to be transformed ?
Have you ever looked at the history of this <unk> region , and said , " How do we see this ?
Or , how do we do better for it ? "
My story , my personal experience , to bring me to the stage of the TED conference , talking about the past decade in the world , even when it 's going to happen .
And I want to share with you the same story , and also the way that I think about this change is also in the creation of changing social movement .
I started to start with the beginning , and I want to introduce you to the next very short history .
It 's very clear in social society .
<unk> fundamentally is made by religion .
And then we came up with a period of time in the 19th century , and since Europe , the <unk> of Europe , in the state of conflict and <unk> .
So the identity of identity is essentially the nation of nation - state countries that <unk> the truth .
In the ' 80s , we continue .
I call it <unk> - <unk> -- where people can have more <unk> , and they 're also the same citizen .
You can be <unk> <unk> ; you can get the Grand Canyon and you 're also a member of Pakistan .
But now I believe we 're going to move forward to a new age , and this new era is called " <unk> era . "
I 'm going to define the duration of the act of <unk> , where the identity of a <unk> is a little bit more sought and story .
These are n't the ways that they 're going to influence the way people behave .
And this is not the good news , because I also believe that hostility is all over the world .
In fact , I also believe that the people who really use this behavior until it 's recently , until the last six months ago , the <unk> use of behavior and <unk> , and they use a range of <unk> and other technologies that are very <unk> .
That 's what I want to talk about .
If we look at Islamic <unk> , if we 're looking at this extreme , they 're most excited about one of the most <unk> skills that other people are going to do , and it 's the same thing that <unk> communication , using technology to organize their activities , to try to create the phenomena in the world .
Now I 've learned that because of the <unk> of my life in a extreme religious organization .
I actually had a <unk> force , especially in <unk> information , and I saw the rise of Islamic modernism and Islamic faith , which is very different , but I 've seen it in the world .
My story , my experience , is a very good portrait of what I want to do .
I was , by the way , from the <unk> of the U.K. and grew up in England .
Anyone from the U.K. knows we 're in <unk> .
Yves <unk> was born in <unk> , and I joined a organization .
When I was 17 years old , I had <unk> choirs in Cambridge .
When I was 19 , I became a leaders of this organization .
When I was 21 years old , I founded this organization .
22 years old I founded this organization in Denmark .
When I was 24 years old , I found three countries in Egypt in the world for three years of <unk> , trying to <unk> their government , and I became tortured as a war for five years .
And in that time , I walked out of the world , and by the way , we laughed for democracy .
We think they 're from the past .
We thought they were very tired .
I learned how to use email from <unk> to <unk> .
And I learned how to deal with it in the way that they 're going to be <unk> .
And then I realized , of course , in Egypt .
But I learned to use technology because I belong to a <unk> organization where you need to think more about the neutral state .
In terms of action , in the case of the story , it 's a quicker way of making behavior and conservatives .
So as I said , we observed and celebrate it .
Not only the Islamic <unk> did this .
But if you look at the <unk> of the White House , even in Europe , it 's going to be <unk> in Europe .
One of the anti - Islamic <unk> is emerging and it 's in <unk> .
And the result of this is that the political force has changed across Europe .
What happened was that the <unk> of the individual <unk> , or the extreme <unk> -- and they had been rejected by each other , but now , as a way of being a global way , it was , in fact , the financial crisis .
Because the Internet and communication technology connects them together .
If you look at the rise of Europe in Europe , you 'll find something that 's happening in the political , but it 's also the same phenomenon of <unk> <unk> .
In some countries , <unk> is <unk> by <unk> .
In other countries , <unk> is <unk> .
The other country , the <unk> meat , is <unk> by <unk> , right now .
On the other hand , we have the Islamic <unk> of <unk> <unk> in their society .
These people are connected to this kind of connection , which makes them feel that they 're actually mainstream .
In particular , it 's almost impossible .
They felt like <unk> , until these advanced technologies came together to connect them with a part of the masses .
And what does this mean with <unk> democracy ?
I believe they 're going to die .
I 'll give you one example .
Do n't remember if you remember Christmas : <unk> <unk> .
It 's an American citizen , and it 's also the <unk> of the Declaration of Independence , he <unk> a son of a woman bank .
This is a Nigerian student in London , and in Yemen , he came up to a flying flight in Amsterdam .
And at the same time , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the student , came up with his father 's dad , and what he said was that his son was going to attack the United States , but for this <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and it does n't have a sense of stepping into behavioral behavior , even more unaware of social movement .
At the end of the last Christmas , it was almost the U.S.
This is also a very scary example : It 's a glamorous example of what we found in the world .
Why are they successful ?
Why do you have a matrix of democracy ?
We need to know the power of social movement to really understand this problem .
In my view , a social movement has four major characteristics .
It 's made of concepts , <unk> , leadership .
I 'm going to give you an example of this , which is the case that you 're all familiar with here , which is the site of <unk> tissue ?
If I want you to think about the idea of Al Qaeda , it 's about <unk> tissue .
I think if I want you to think about the legitimacy of this organization , the Western state -- in the West , in Western countries , to fight Islam , <unk> Islam -- you can quickly think of it .
By the way , the difference between the idea and legitimacy of the concept is that the notion of a person believes this is the reason that this organization is , because it 's a way to sell it -- <unk> , if you like , to say that .
That 's the idea of <unk> <unk> and story , immediately .
If I ask you their symbols and their leaders , you can immediately think about it immediately .
One recent study of leaders was killed in Pakistan .
These symbols and leaders are very quick to think about it quickly .
And that 's the power of social movement .
They do n't think they 're going to work with ideas , <unk> , symbols , purity .
But if I get you to focus on the <unk> , and to think about the symbols of those <unk> and leaders in the world today , you think that pressure is a lot of stress , especially when you want to get rid of it .
It means that it does n't exist from definition .
One of the problems that we 're looking at is , in my view , there 's no scientific movement in the world , the slope of a culture of democracy , especially in Muslims , particularly in most of Muslims most .
There are no religious societies in the Muslims , without <unk> , democracy .
There is no idea , <unk> , leadership , and symbols from the interior , the <unk> democracy .

Why is it that <unk> organization , whether it 's extremely high , or Islamic <unk> -- Islamic molecule -- which means that the <unk> of a Muslim <unk> is in a way to organize the history of the world , and why they 've got a special <unk> in the way that they 're dealing with a global culture .
I do n't believe there are four reasons .
First , it 's <unk> .
Because all of the people who are involved in democracy are <unk> , or <unk> communities , but the social , powerful societies , societies .
This is something that means that they do n't think they need to be arguing about this culture .
Secondly , I believe it 's about politics .
We 've been working on democracy , because we 're in the nature of the natural world -- we <unk> it to the values of our values -- with <unk> molecule , connection .
But in fact , when we talk about human rights , we really say that Human rights are around the world .
But once you get to <unk> this idea , this behavior is connected to new <unk> or Islam .
And to <unk> around the world , I believe that democracy is the best way we 're going to organize the political activities that <unk> politics often are connected to <unk> .
And thirdly , most of the societies in the Muslim world are elected to the political , which means that capitalism is going to get people to vote for them as warriors , but then there will be other parties , trying to <unk> as a <unk> -- try to do it for <unk> .
And the third thing is to stand up and say , " Give us a vote . We 'll build a <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> became one of the political choices that <unk> in the society in this society .
And as the result is that when these party are elected , or inevitable , it becomes <unk> , <unk> becomes the <unk> of their political mistakes .
And then people say , " We try <unk> , it does n't fit us . "
" We continue to use <unk> . "
The fourth reason is , I think it 's in this slide I call <unk> <unk> .
And what I want to say is that if the <unk> of the world is a communist country , then it 's more likely to use democracy as well as anti - rebel , and now the global power of democracy is the United States .
That seems to be more difficult to say that four reasons to make democracy increasingly , especially as a mere civilization , not just a political option .
When we talk about this , we need to break some <unk> concepts .
Is it just about <unk> ?
It 's just about losing education ?
And it shows that most of the people who come up with <unk> organizations have high education .
They 're saying that they 're more educational than a decade of educational education .
So for example , we can prove that poor people are only the only factor , or Bin Laden is one of the richest countries from Saudi Arabia .
His son , <unk> , is a pediatrician -- not a lack of liberal arts .
The recent international aid and development continues , but in these societies , they 're evolving rapidly .
I believe that <unk> is really the real ground movement , especially in front of the bottom , except the international aid , besides health .
It 's not independence , but it 's a real need for them to do the real demand for the ground .
And I believe that this is the opposite of the <unk> .
And then the idea of <unk> is that you 're starting to create a way to deliver democracy to the ground , to bring democracy values .
But the <unk> of Islamic molecules and <unk> <unk> , in a few decades , is building their demand for the ground .
They built a civilization - <unk> civilization , especially in the horizontal currents , and we saw these societies that were responsible for some kind of social needs .
The <unk> of Pakistan in Pakistan , the main foundation of the Arab Age , is that it 's not an inclusive group , rather than a democracy .
Because it 's the beginning of <unk> , and they 're trying to build their demand on the ground .
And one of the most important is the movement of a real - term <unk> of <unk> , which can be active and <unk> -- not just election .
But no choice , no freedom of <unk> .
No human rights , you do n't have to go .
There are no <unk> , you 're not going to have a force .
So what we need is that the <unk> of democracy in <unk> is <unk> in these regions of these areas .
And so you can avoid the question that I talked about earlier , especially the <unk> parties of <unk> , in those societies that are just a political option and other options , such as military force .
But if we can build this in the ice level , it 's not just from the political point , not only from a political level -- not about the movement of <unk> , but to create this civilization - cultural movement .
And the final thing that we 're going to see is that one of the ideal things that you can see in this slide is not to vote in democracy .
But in order to achieve the political <unk> of the community , it 's not the politics of <unk> , but certainly the military <unk> -- for example , you vote in a living democracy , and this democracy is not just one option .
In order to get to that stage , we need to start building social skills in the field .
Now , the question is , how did this happen ?
Egypt is a good building .
The Arab uprising declared this all the time .
But it does n't happen to me in the corporate world of the Arab Age and Europe .
And what 's happening is that there 's a political recession that goes together to create an political policy .
We need to move further .
We need to understand how to help the social flow of societies that are very , very <unk> , changing the <unk> of the civilization of civilization , and the benefits of democracy can be powerful .
Because it 's not enough to do it for a leader or a <unk> .
It will not guarantee that it will be a social social society .
But in fact , the trend in the beginning of Egypt has begun to spread across the areas of <unk> , Middle East and the Middle East .
So when the Arabic minister went on in Egypt , went through that area .
In the ' 80s , when it was in the middle of the <unk> , it took all the whole Middle East everywhere .
What we 're trying to do is -- like young <unk> today , the <unk> <unk> are <unk> themselves , not just for terrorists -- is that there 's a opportunity to get democracy in the area of the state , in terms of <unk> .
But it 's going to require us to help that social social movement to create real quality social movements to <unk> democracy .
We 've developed a movement from Pakistan , called <unk> , where we 're working on the ground to encourage young people to create the reality of democracy .
I 'm going to end with this idea as close .
I 'm going to talk to you today about this .

<unk> <unk> : Social change history
I talk about changing media , and now people can use media to share the media in any place .
I 'm going to explain through some stories about this change .
First , the president of November November last year .
You can read some news news .
There 's a problem in the U.S.
There is a plan to be elected elections .
This is the idea that every citizen passes with a photo and a camera , documenting their elections , to repair any <unk> of the <unk> , and to <unk> the center of a [ <unk> ] space .
This is a kind of civic view of the use of self - control , citizenship , it 's not just about the human citizen , but also helping making sure that the entire election is the holy .
And it made sure that we had to be connected to elections .
This is not technology . It 's social .
These tools are kind of <unk> , unless technology uses better and more interesting to social skills .
It 's not about <unk> new technologies , and their use is begun to spread through social skills .
But every person started realizing that this is inevitable .
Because now the media is very social , and innovation is in any place where people think we 're all embedded .
So we started looking at media innovation in any place . From a place where we 're going to move to another place .
It 's a huge change .
We do n't have to list more . We 're in the history of history in history , in our history .
Now , a big request . I 'll tell you .
In the last 500 years , there 's about four changes in the next 500 media , which has a transformative change .
The first is famous , publishing medium . But carrying , <unk> , innovation , creativity , start to shift in the middle of the century to change Europe .
And then over the last hundred years , there are two types of communication media , which is the media innovation , the first one , the first one .
<unk> , the text will say , well , let 's talk about it .
And then , about 150 years ago , there is a change in the printing press , and it 's the first photo , first of all , to reveal the sound , and then the film , all of a sudden , has been called <unk> .
And finally , about 100 years ago , the use of electric light starts through air , <unk> , television and <unk> .
That 's the media that we know about the 20th century .
That 's where people have grown up with experience and experience .
But it 's a strange relationship to this .
The media is talking about <unk> , but there are no groups .
She does n't engage in a conversation with a group of groups .
If you want to have a whole phrase in the world , you and another <unk> .
If you want to <unk> tissues , you get the same information that you 're sending to the organization , regardless of the <unk> or print - makers or <unk> .
This is the media that we have in the 20th century .
That 's changed .
This is something that looks like a windshield 's license .
And he 's tracking the <unk> of personal personal networks , and then they <unk> them .
The Internet is the first medium for nature to create organizations , and also dialogue in the same time .
It 's just a form of forms for us . television , radio , magazine , books , <unk> , give us a lot of media forms .
The first media is a very good job of <unk> .
This is one of the largest changes .
The second change is that all of the press starts to turn the Internet into all the media , which means that the telephone goes up to the Web , and the magazine go to the Internet .
It means every media and every single media is connected .
In other words , the media is getting less news . He 's much more growth , because the organization can see , you 've seen it , to hear some things , and to listen to each other .
The third change is a member of the audience , like Dan <unk> called them , and now they can become consumers .
Every time a new consumer is added into this media , and the same equipment , because the telephone , the computer , makes you consume and production .
This is like , as you buy books , they 're free of free print , and when you take the button , you turn your mobile phone .
There is a huge change in our media .
It 's not just <unk> or <unk> .
We have the public , and we 've got about 20 years to get the more social social change in the world .
And he changes the form , although some organizations know how to do it .
Second story .
Last year , China is happening in the <unk> earthquake in China , which is horrible <unk> in areas of <unk> .
When the earthquake happened , it was published .
People use the phone . People get the photos .
This is the building video video .
The largest <unk> in China to China .
They have this information .
And that happens when the hurricane happened .
Because the community , the Chinese students go to the Grand Canyon . Other countries in the country are open to China , and people are trying to understand this news .
The first news for the BBC is the first news for China to get China .
Everything that happened on the earthquake is a few minutes ago than anyone in the U.S.
And this is the same earthquake that China has spent about three months of the time that the earthquake has happened .
Now they might like to do this , rather than seeing these <unk> images .
But they did n't have a lot of money because they were writing about the news .
Even government figures from their own citizens , not from <unk> .
This is a bit of a <unk> .
There was a couple of times a few people who were connected to the Web , and the global email service , there was nine link .
People are <unk> in the details , the American <unk> <unk> .
It 's like the carrot 's license , but that 's what it 's about for you .
10 million first of all time .
And in the <unk> of <unk> , the license of the world goes into the world .
This is really amazing , the global response to the world .
And then China , the media , decides that it 's going to make it happen . They start to bring the residents into the <unk> .
And this happened .
In <unk> , people started to point out , a lot of schools in the earthquake , because it was in school , and so many of the schools were at the beginning of a school .
And then the citizens started writing about it . There was a <unk> photo .
You can see it in the New York Times .
A local <unk> in the streets of the street goes directly , and they leave them down .
And basically , " We 're going to fix everything . Please stop <unk> . "
But people were overwhelmed because they had lost their next generation .
Some people see the death rates of <unk> children now .
So the <unk> will continue .
And finally , China is doing the <unk> of <unk> .
There are many groups of people .
So they started harvesting the <unk> .
They start doing media media .
China is probably the most successful online network of people in the world , using some <unk> <unk> .
China is made out of <unk> <unk> to make sure that humor is the media , the main acceleration of the world , and a relatively slow medium .
And through this four traits that can filter it , it goes into China .
It 's like the Grand Canyon , the Chinese panic kicked away , because the four traits are <unk> for the next four .
Because the media is <unk> and <unk> .
The media is quickly becoming <unk> , and the government has no way to organize the media .
So now , I 've spent 20 years on the site , and it 's very successful to try to decide whether you 're going to get rid of the whole <unk> or closed the entire servers because the public media is so big and good .
It happened every week .
In the 20 anniversary of the anniversary anniversary birthday sentence they 've been looking at the use of <unk> , and it 's not going to turn it down .
They need to shut the entire <unk> .
Now these changes are not just the people who vary information .
And he also influenced the information of information . This is a ecosystem of a <unk> -- not just a special strategy .
Now , since the 20th century , the traditional media problem is how to distribute a message to a <unk> member of the network .
That 's the answer to the 20th century .
<unk> : <unk> to everyone .
<unk> information . Yves bears .
<unk> <unk> .
Very expensive . So there 's no <unk> competition .
That 's how you 're information .
That 's all the past .
We 've got a media global imperative . Social social , diversity , <unk> .
Now most of the organization began to launch information to outside the world , <unk> public attention , right now .
The public can <unk> .
It 's a little quirky , but you 've got a sense of doing it .
We live in our lives , but it 's certainly not a crazy change .
<unk> change is here . In fact , they 're not going to be <unk> . The consumer will go to the <unk> , and the public can communicate directly with another public , because the size of the Internet is actually the equivalent of a number of square times , but the network , it 's very , very regular .
Most of the media in the last decade of public consumption is an honor to form .
That 's all the time .
Now it 's a green information , free content , my last story .
In Obama , I saw some <unk> social media used .
I 'm not talking about political applications , but most of the creative applications of <unk> .
One of the most famous ones in Obama , the famous famous , <unk> tribe , they built a lot of millions of tribes , trying to understand how to help Obama .
<unk> dialogue starts to emerge .
And then , in the last year , Obama announced that he would change his <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And in one of the months he said , you 're going to never look at this <unk> system in the U.S.
And in summer , in large , he said , I think many . I want to change my view .
I 'm going to do this for this <unk> .
And so many of the people in his network have been open to the <unk> of his own website .
They had <unk> Obama , and they changed the president .
Please let the financial crisis <unk> .
As a result of a few days , it 's the quickest spread of the population , and within weeks , he was the largest .
President Obama came to the news .
He had to be <unk> .
And he says , " I 've been thinking about this .
I understand where you come from .
But the whole thing is , I 'm going to go to <unk> .
But I want you to know , I 'm not going to tell you that you 're not satisfied with me .
It did n't stop anyone . But it happened in this <unk> thing .
The people who realized that Barack Obama did n't look down .
There was no person in Obama who was trying to try and manage the organization or make organizations difficult to make it difficult , and <unk> it , <unk> the site .
They know their role to <unk> <unk> , but not control their <unk> .
This is a system that has been used by the media .
And the media , we know , a very familiar press , is the simple idea of professional sexual subjects to <unk> <unk> .
In this world , media is the globalization of globalization , social , local , <unk> , medium - and - a - tech ratio , and the world is very , very interested in the media , in that world .
It will be more robust to create a way to connect and support tissue .
We have a choice , regardless of the media environment , and anyone who is good for us would think about the world to understand the information media .
That 's the media we need .
Now the question we have is , " How do we use this media ?
Though he does n't think we need to change the way we do it . "
Thank you very much .
<unk>
And when the <unk> <unk> happened , Ken <unk> is the only doctor in <unk> , and in TEDMED , he shares the incredible <unk> of <unk> in the extreme conditions , which is <unk> with the brain .
adventure , biology , exploration , humanity , medicine , science
<unk>
Ken <unk> : The medical miracle of <unk>
In the course of this conference , we 've heard a lot about the power of human will .
And what I want to do today is to give you an example of how people are going to be released from the environment , and how the power of this force is <unk> .
This is an event in <unk> , and it 's the most glamorous disaster in history .
When <unk> happened , I was the only doctor .
So I 'm going to bring you through this catastrophe , and that 's what happens when people get to survive , when they 're <unk> to live .
This is <unk> .
<unk> feet tall .
And I went there , and I was six months old , four is following the National <unk> <unk> , which is about the <unk> of the U.S.
When I was two years old , I had a <unk> in my fourth grade .
<unk> <unk> tells us that this is a <unk> , and then you think we should listen to them .
<unk> is an extreme environment .
<unk> oxygen is only three percent of sea oxygen .
And over the course of <unk> , ice can get over 40 degrees .
The wind is sometimes about 20 to 40 miles per hour .
This is actually " <unk> factor , " which is more cold than Mars .
And I remember that one day , I got rid of the corner of my mailbox , trying to take my glasses off my shorts , and my burning was in my <unk> , but I found out the water that was frozen in <unk> .
You can imagine that the <unk> environment is a little bit scary .
This is <unk> <unk> .
Start with <unk> ft .
And the first one is <unk> .
It 's about 2,000 feet per second , the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is in the <unk> of <unk> , and the world is the fourth high - speed street , but it 's worse than <unk> .
Yves <unk> is the most <unk> than 3,000 feet .
This is <unk> .
It 's based on <unk> feet .
And this is what you 're going to do with your toes of the ice that you do n't climb , and then you have to have a <unk> .
And that 's exactly what I did . I had four <unk> of a medical supply kit , and I was all wrapped up on a tent . This was me <unk> .
This is our <unk> .
It 's a state of National <unk> , but it 's based on remix <unk> .
And there were three three piles of <unk> in the mountains , and a leopard , a <unk> , an <unk> camera .
And over the course of two months , we 're building the <unk> <unk> .
This is the view of the sky . It comes from the first 2,000 feet of <unk> .
This is a picture of an image of a <unk> . It 's actually a waterfall , but it 's <unk> , and it has changed every day .
When you look at it , it feels like a mouse in the <unk> , and even not seeing the top .
That 's where the distance goes down .
As soon as it came to the night , the ice was filled with ice .
It gets slowly breaking off the ice .
This is some of the jackets from <unk> in <unk> .
This is me approaching a <unk> .
We climb into a safe anesthesia <unk> .
This is another <unk> .
Some of them are <unk> , and even deeper , it 's even worse to me and say , " Why are we going to get to the bottom of the night , because if we can see what we see here , we 're killing the <unk> that we 've got .
This is the first camp .
That 's the first time in <unk> , and it 's a first <unk> of <unk> .
From there , we continue to climb in two houses , and it looks like a <unk> .
These <unk> are moving into the third town .
They <unk> <unk> .
If you 're swimming down here , there is no turning of wire , and it 's about 5,000 feet tall .
This is images of the <unk> camp .
You can see the <unk> on the side of the wing , the six - year - old <unk> , which takes two days to climb up , so you have to <unk> in <unk> .
And if you look at it carefully , you 'll notice it 's black .
There was no ice of ice .
And this is because <unk> is so unpredictable , it 's <unk> the surface of the <unk> , so it does n't have a <unk> .
And then the <unk> looks like something like a wall of clouds , which is actually <unk> by wind .
This is <unk> <unk> , <unk> - <unk> . Across the clouds .
This is <unk> camp .
Once you get the Grand Canyon , you just have about 24 hours to decide whether you 're going to die .
Because everybody needs oxygen heat , and oxygen <unk> is limited . So you have to make decisions , or you 've got to decide , whether it 's <unk> .
This is a picture of de <unk> .
His name is <unk> <unk> .
This is what he 's called to call his wife 's radio , and I 'll wait for you to tell you .
This is <unk> <unk> .
They 're picking up the refugee camp . You can see , <unk> <unk> .
And this quality of the weather is <unk> , so those <unk> are just <unk> ; they 're <unk> to slow down .
In fact , it 's true in the night night .
It 's got really <unk> . It does n't have wind .
It seemed to be a fabulous <unk> .
And here 's a couple of people who are starting to move into <unk> , and they 're called " <unk> <unk> . "
This is just the first step .
This is at night , because the bottom line is much bigger than this <unk> , so it 's going to go back in the late night .
This is what happened .
They went to <unk> .
This is a picture of <unk> <unk> .
It 's in love .
From here , the distance is about 30 ft .
But what 's going to happen is that the wind is the wind , and suddenly it 's sudden <unk> .
<unk> is under <unk> .
You 've seen some <unk> diving here .
And they 're on the bottom line .
This is a picture of a photograph I did a year ago , and you can see the oxygen <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I have a oxygen <unk> here .
And you can see that two levels of oxygen in this room , small <unk> <unk> , very boring , and we do n't have a lot of other things .
That 's all you need to do . In <unk> , everything is <unk> .
This is a photo shot on the <unk> .
This is the way to the <unk> path of <unk> feet .
All the seniors are n't <unk> , because because the two sides are extremely glamorous , if you 're connected to other people , once you interact with others .
So everybody is <unk> .
And the slope of the explosion is not a straight line . This is very tough climb , always has the risk of risk .
If you look at the left , you 're going to fall down to about 8,000 feet to Nepal , and if you want to raise the right - hand hand , you 're going to fall up to Tibet .
So still in Tibet , at least you can live for a period of time .
But anyway , you 're all going to die .
These are the ones who are going to get to the top , and you 're looking at the underside of the <unk> that you see in the bottom , but I 'm at the bottom of this hill .
My <unk> was in the <unk> refugee camp , and these were <unk> in <unk> .
And that <unk> is so successful that we have to paste down , the wildlife lying down in the tent to stop the tent .
That 's the worst sin I ever ever met .
And those are the ones who are in the middle of the ice , where we 're <unk> about 2,000 feet higher than us .
We are connected by some of the people in the radio and the people .
This is a photo shot from the <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> from the radio <unk> in the <unk> , and it 's <unk> <unk> on the board , Doug Engelbart .
We heard about Jupiter , but Doug Engelbart , you ca n't help .
He 's <unk> . That 's where it goes .
We 've heard some other bad news about <unk> , and another one of the founders of <unk> has been <unk> .
And there 's another 18 <unk> that we did n't know .
They 're lost in the sea . It 's a lot of fun , and it 's all about <unk> .
We do n't know anything about it .
We 're just in a tent in the <unk> camp .
The most fundamental two <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> decided to go to try and try to figure out what 's going on , but it 's still a <unk> war .
They tried to send information to de - <unk> information . Rob <unk> is a terrific <unk> , but it was a relatively <unk> <unk> .
And I thought they 'd say that they 're going to say , " Keep , we 'll let it go . "
But in fact , they say , " <unk> Doug Lessig , you 're responsible for it .
There 's no chance to save his opportunity , and most importantly , it 's saving yourself . "
And Jupiter received this information , but his vote is , " We 're all in the <unk> . "
<unk> and Buddhism ended up <unk> <unk> , waiting for them .
But they 're also not stable at the same time .
And I went from <unk> to the symptom of the radio , and we asked them to have the ability to self - police themselves .
The people who are <unk> , we decided to put them down in the <unk> camp .
So they 're moving through this kind of thing .
This is in <unk> camp , and I was painting the photos .
And they came up with me , so I looked at them , and looking at what I could do . But I did n't do much , because it was a little hole in the age of 45 .
It 's hard to walk outside the tent .
Because it 's really <unk> . It 's accelerating .
And in that peak , the only medical device that I found was two pounds of plastic and Holland .
So these <unk> came to me , and I started looking at whether they were participating .
And for those who have n't been <unk> , I 'm going to give you the <unk> of the Netherlands , and I 'll give them a little bit of a <unk> to help them get <unk> and <unk> .
At the end of the day , sometimes it 's a very difficult thing to do , and I have to have a direct <unk> for their clothing .
It 's hard to work in the same way .
When I take care of these patients , we get a lot about Jupiter .
At the time , we 're not going to take him to the height of him .
And he called us up and told us what he is now .
And obviously , Doug Engelbart is in the <unk> .
But de <unk> has become <unk> , and they 're not going to climb it up . The wind is still so successful and so he 's totally <unk> and he knows this .
In those situations , he asked his wife .
And he took a radio .
And her wife , <unk> , in New Zealand , playing their first child 's first boy , and Jupiter and her partner , we 've done his plea . And then Tim and his wife did the last time .
<unk> for their kids .
And then Tim came up , and then the last time we heard him .
And what I did was I could n't do a medical task that was n't going to happen -- the <unk> of <unk> , which had a bunch of <unk> people .
So what we did was we started to bring these patients to <unk> feet , even more convenient to me .
This is my medical box .
It 's a <unk> of medical care .
And that 's what I did .
I have more <unk> in <unk> , and I 've called it all the time to bring these <unk> to the <unk> .
And that was the scene of the <unk> <unk> .
They go into the <unk> .
There are some people who are <unk> , and some of them have been born , but they 're all <unk> .
We try to get them to <unk> their bodies , giving them oxygen , help them breathe , and it 's not a easy thing to do .
This is a foot on the feet , and there 's a severe <unk> on his nose .
This <unk> is <unk> .
As soon as I did , the magic thing happened .
And <unk> did n't know where he came from , and we told him that he was <unk> , but now he 's like a <unk> in a tent .
And I thought , well , he 's going to wake up , but actually he says , " Hey , Tony . What should I sit down ?
And then he said , " You accept my health ? "
That 's his <unk> .
Though he was very <unk> , she was <unk> .
And you can see , his hand is already filled with his face and his nose is <unk> .
It <unk> , when it comes to the <unk> stage , it will fall very quickly .
This is the final step , like a <unk> .
And when I was concerned about <unk> , he came to me all over the place .
And he said he lost down in the <unk> , and he was lying down there .
And some of the <unk> came out of his lips , and he heard him say , " He 's dead . "
But <unk> did n't die , he could hear the conversation . He could n't move .
And he 's in a state of a <unk> state -- it can feel the environment , but it 's not going to tell others that it 's alive to tell people that he is alive .
So <unk> went down to her , <unk> lying there , and day day , there was no day .
But he told himself , " I do n't want to die .
My family was waiting for me . "
His wife and his wife , his wives , gave him his power , <unk> his motivation , and he 's going to stand up .
And in the snow , after a long period of time he stood up , and he found back back to the grave .
<unk> <unk> brings me to this story , but I was completely touched .
I ca n't imagine anyone who can be paralyzed in ice , but it can still stand up .
And obviously , he <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And I can only anticipate how he does this .
If we stack up a computer scanner , and look at his brain , what do we see ?
And this is the three sections of the brain : the frontal lobe -- to focus your attention , and the temporal effects -- for example , to create the structure of <unk> and <unk> -- and in the back of your brain , there 's a whole generation of things that have to do with <unk> , like <unk> <unk> .
So let 's see here , this is the <unk> chip of the brain , imagining it 's even in this brain scanner .
And measured the dynamic blood flow , the energy flow of the brain .
There 's a lot of activity here , a lot of activity .
This is a continuous - sized brain .
The center of the brain is that the temporal lobe is going to be here , and this is the <unk> of <unk> .
This is a normal brain chip , and it 's a very average scale .
And then look at this chip , the frontal lobe is excited .
And this is probably what happens when <unk> realized that it 's happening in the dictionary .
He 's focused on all of his attention , and he 's going to tell you about it .
The brain activity is <unk> .
And in this situation , he did n't think his family or any other person , or whatever , to fight .
He <unk> his muscle , <unk> him .
But he started sweating .
He does n't have enough energy .
And the weather is very cold , and he ca n't keep him . As you can see here , it 's not just red . His brain begins .
He 's got a drop in the stomach , and everything is <unk> .
It 's a little bit more energy .
He 's waiting for the death .
But when we come to the next brain chip , we 'll see the middle part of the brain as well .
He was thinking about his family .
There 's all sorts of images of the family who look at the family that stand up .
And just by thinking , he <unk> energy in this region .
This is how he can transform ideas into action .
The brain is called outside the <unk> .
Many of the brain experts believe that this region will be the most human will .
This is where people make decisions , nurturing .
And as you can see , a energy is coming from the middle of his family 's brain , and the brain is going to go into the area of the region .
And this energy has become more robust until it becomes a motivation .
And after day day , he 's going to <unk> enough energy at that day to motivate enough power to do it .
As you can see , his frontal lobe begins more energy .
And he 's starting to focus on it . He can get tired of it now .
And he 's thinking about how to save himself .
And so that energy has been moved into his brain , and it becomes increasingly <unk> , but he 's using this energy to think about a way to <unk> him .
And then this energy , the energy that grows in his mind , is the same .
He does n't have his family right now , but he 's thinking about how to remix himself .
This is the brain back , helping his muscle <unk> , and he 's going to start self - righting .
His heart and his lungs will start to jump .
If we could put <unk> in the computer , I assumed that this was what happened when he was a stunning <unk> .
This is where I care about <unk> feet in <unk> , and everything that does n't feel like I feel so much so tiny .
This is how you show the power of human beings .
It 's really a big deal . There are so many other people who are very big . Fortunately , we have a shipping vessel .
A <unk> came out of the <unk> of human history to the highest leopard <unk> .
It 's swimming in ice , and it 's going to be <unk> and all the other things that you 've seen before , but before we get rid of the medical clinic , we 've washed them into a clinic .
This is a shot of one of the founders of <unk> in <unk> , in the <unk> .
And after a few days , we had a <unk> ritual there .
This is some people burning <unk> <unk> .
Because they believe that the <unk> are sanctity .
And they 're standing in the middle of the <unk> with these leopard seals , and they get to <unk> , to groom them .
There are <unk> <unk> .
This is Scott <unk> , Jupiter , <unk> <unk> and Doug Engelbart and <unk> .
And there 's another winner of the day , but it does n't have any , he 's a <unk> <unk> .
And the reason he died is because he could call it an incredible powers , to save himself .
These are the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> people believe that if you 're going to write it in these mines , your message will be carried out .
Thank you .

Yves <unk> , an <unk> CEO , is the founder of the <unk> business company , and in this talk , he makes decisions for four points of development .
business , development , economics , global issues , politics , potential , technology , third world

<unk> <unk> on the future of India
So let me introduce you to the evolution of India and India .
And I think this is a very interesting way , because in every society , particularly open democracy , there 's only a way to change it .
The idea of thinking consists of ideology , and the <unk> , the <unk> , is ultimately the end .
In <unk> , in the United States , the <unk> of the National <unk> Foundation came up with different sorts of issues .
In the 1980s , the Reagan Revolution , <unk> government police .
Now , the explosion of global economic crisis has developed a new set of rules about how the state should be <unk> .
So the idea is change .
And we look at India , and we 're going to see that India has a huge impact on India .
The first one , I think , is called " <unk> . "
These are the effects of the <unk> of India today .
The second idea , I call them " <unk> . "
These ideas are already being accepted , but it 's not glamorous .
And the third idea , I call them , " discussing what we 're arguing about in the reality , whether it 's supposed to work in reality .
The fourth idea , which is that I think the most important idea is , " We have to think about it . "
Because , as a developing world , we look at the problems of the world where the other countries are facing the problem , and you can adjust the way it 's going to make a difference .
In India , I think there are six concepts that make us think today .
The first is the understanding of the idea of people .
In <unk> , people are a stress .
It 's a burden .
Now , people are <unk> for us .
People are <unk> for us .
And I believe that this is the <unk> of people who are able to say , " That 's the most fundamental change in the human mind .
And the idea of this idea is that it 's in the real world of the world , the <unk> of India .
And as a result of <unk> mortality , mortality percent of the deaths are starting to reduce .
There 's a lot of people who are going to have the young people in India coming up in the next 30 years .
This is the unique part of the population , which is India that is going to become the only country that 's going to be the only country that has a population of people .
And that means that India will become the only one in the world 's disease .
This is a very important thing . There is the difference between the population of India , which is that there are two people in the Indian population .
A <unk> in India , in the South and the West , will continue to go to seasonal ice because of the <unk> of the areas .
Another one in the north India will become the idea of the future of population population .
But these demographics are like the investment of <unk> investment .
It 's only when people accept good education , the infrastructure , when they 're working on road roads , they do n't care about it .
In other words , if we do n't have the same population of people who invest in these people , there might be a population that 's going to become population <unk> .
So , in terms of the importance of India , if it 's not going to increase the population of people 's population , then the road comes out of the population .
Secondly , India changed the definition of entrepreneur .
In the first time , it 's been seen by independent scientists as a group of prescription people .
But today , about 60 years later , when <unk> has become a reality of reality , what do you do ?
This change has changed the whole economy .
I think the third vision of change is the change that we 're dealing with in English .
Before English is known as a language language .
But now the <unk> of globalization increased English language to help people get intimacy .
It became an incredible <unk> of learning .
English also becomes a huge <unk> of capital .
We have technology .
40 years ago , the computers are really scared for us , and people who are <unk> people will lose work .
This is a country we 've been selling every month of <unk> phones , 90 phones per month , because people do n't have <unk> .
<unk> cell phones are less than 20 every year .
Technology has been silenced by large <unk> , and it 's been used by the display .
So the beginning of a period of human threats to the human race is <unk> by technology .
One 20 years ago , one of the founders of San <unk> reports -- people do n't have this report called the computer , and they call them <unk> <unk> .
They do n't want to make the streets think it 's computer .
And then they want to use higher and more powerful computers , when they do n't want to be more powerful .
And then we went through a lot of calls to become an <unk> tool and really change the way that people look at technology .
On the other hand , the Indian people are never going to adapt to global growth .
There 's 200 years of people who live in <unk> , and they 're in the <unk> company , the values of the world , their normal response to the ecology of globalization , thinks that it 's a movement .
But now a lot of Indian companies come up to spread across the world , and they 've been working on all the time , so they 're so confident that they can engage the realm of globalization .
We have an advantage in population , because we are the only young nation in the world , which is a very young country that has a lot of spontaneous attraction to India .
And the last point is that India is happening in the beginning of democracy .
When the 60 years ago democracy came to India , it was just a point of a few people .
A little bit of people who want to bring democracy to India , because they think they 're going to do different ideas for India like voting , Australia , Congress , <unk> .
But now democracy has become <unk> , every single person realizes that there are benefits and openness to <unk> .
And this is what democracy is .
And I think this is the rise of six concepts of the concept of Indian literacy language language languages , where the Chinese language becomes a <unk> , and the world is starting to create positive effects , which are <unk> -- and these are the ones that make a difference today that has never been developed today -- that 's unprecedented .
Let 's start with the idea of <unk> .
These ideas have no problem in society , but it ca n't be done yet .
There are four concepts of this idea .
One is education .
And because of some reason , the reason for that is that we lack of money , because religion has a lot of cultural effects that do n't have <unk> .
But I think it 's a very important moment .
And we 're very upset about the fact that governments are not paying attention to the amount of money , and kids are not going to go to school .
Even 50 percent of the city 's city is going to go in to private school .
So the normal thing about the school is a challenge .
And yet , everybody is very hopeful that poor people are n't exception , wanting their kids .
So I think the <unk> idea has been <unk> but not yet .
Similarly , infrastructure is also a very long time for a long period of time .
People who come to India have felt it .
This is completely different from China .
But now it 's the beginning of the building , and the idea is that the idea that people are going to achieve .
This is in the <unk> .
And 20 years ago , the political slogan was " <unk> , " " meaning " which means " food , clothing and shelter . "
Now the political slogan is " <unk> , " which means " " power " -- " meaning power , water and road . "
This is the transition infrastructure of the mind , certainly , of course .
So I believe that the idea is that there 's no way of showing you .
<unk> is the city .
Because the <unk> of <unk> are <unk> from the city , and the British <unk> comes from cities , so it does n't make the New Mexico as a typical Indian city .
We 've never seen that we 're missing the city .
You can see from the real world .
But now in the experience of economic reform and economic growth , cities have developed economy to promote the economy for creativity , and that theory of creativity is ultimately the end of people who are participating .
I think you can see the trend of the city .
This is also the same thing that has been accepted yet , but it 's not yet .
The last idea is that India is a single market , because when you do n't think about India as a marketplace , you 're not interested in it because it does n't care .
And so you have a situation that has a product for every state of state .
It 's a market - <unk> market .
Now the current policy infrastructure is building and <unk> , and it 's going to take India as a single market market .
So in the world , there 's also a global trend here , and it 's important to the globalization of globalization .
The four factor is the foundation of the building , the <unk> , and the single market , which is about India , has n't done yet .
Next is the idea of discussion .
We 're arguing about this .
It 's often <unk> .
And guess what ? First , I think , that 's our illusion .
And because of the <unk> of India , it 's because there 's a lot of people who have been dumped so many political jobs , and they 're trying to make sure that it 's something that makes it .
<unk> have a lot of <unk> and other methods .
And this is also about the way we think of people with people on the sides of our hands .
There 's a lot of problems that are about non - <unk> institutions and other things .
And this is <unk> .
This is a problem that requires problem .
And the second is that our labor policy is hard to create <unk> in corporate companies , so that the Indian workforce is in non - organizing situations .
They did n't have any social care without any health care whatsoever .
This is something that has to change because if you ca n't afford to provide the <unk> of the people in the world , there will be an urge .
So we need to create a new set of <unk> to get rid of us today .
In the same time , it 's going to be a lot more people to bring into the deepest industry and create jobs for millions of people .
And that 's what we 're doing .
In India , India was completely <unk> .
<unk> is hard to start college .
The university college also came to India .
And the result is that we ca n't afford to satisfy India .
So a lot of the problems we have to focus on .
But I think the most important thing is we need to figure out what 's going on .
India is able to do something about what 's going on in the West , and it does it .
First of all , we 're very lucky to be much more sophisticated about technology in the developing world .
So we can use technology .
We can use technology directly directly .
We can use technology to be able to increase anti - nanotechnology .
The second thing is health care .
In India , people have a serious health problem , such as Alzheimer 's disease , rapid illness diseases .
So we ca n't get a whole range of deaths in the period of population - time disease that we have .
So we have to rethink the way we look at the operating system .
We need a strategy that we 're not going to get in .
In the same way , we can see that the cost of social resources in the West is increasing health care spending .
So for a young country , there is a chance to build a modern <unk> system , which is not going to occur in old age .
The other thing that India ca n't believe is that the environment and the development is <unk> .
So for you to give you a sense of the <unk> world , steady stability is in 200 <unk> .
For nine million people per year , we drove per amount of CO2 per year .
India has gone every year .
But if India is growing up in the age of eight , it will be the 16 times per year .
So we said that the price grew up 16 times faster than CO2 .
So we can radically change the attitudes of the environment , and we create new models for the developing world .
Why is this important for you ?
Why do n't you see what happens to you ?
First , it 's important because it means more than 100,000 people .
10 people are the ones in the world .
It 's important because it 's the basis of democracy .
So it 's important that growth and democracy are also important , and we can have democracy that can be open - minded .
And the importance of it is that if these problems solve the world , the poverty problem is <unk> .
The importance of it is that it 's also the key to tackle the world 's issues .
If we really want to tackle the limit of what we 're going to really do , we need to be able to actually reduce the power of the energy emissions in India .
If we look at the average scale of the West , it 's about two billion dollars per increase .
What we 're talking about here is the growth of eight to eight percent of the country .
There 's a lot of difference .
When you increase the population rate , it grows in two million years to increase their income per hour .
When economic growth rises up to eight million people , 50 percent reduction in every nine years .
We do n't really have the entire process of getting a billion people out of happiness .
We have to have a clear strategy for India .
Because I think you need to look at this problem like me .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> thinks , in the last 50 years , five great Revolution of political culture , and his <unk> demos these Revolution -- and how it 's going to happen from the <unk> of the 19th century -- how to make democracy , as he says , <unk> democracy .
culture , global issues , politics
<unk>
<unk> : No trust , democracy can continue to exist ?
And I said , " Well , I 'm probably one of the most important speakers ever ever ever see TED .
First , I do n't have cell phones , so I 'm safe .
Secondly , as a political <unk> , I 'm going to talk to you about the crisis of democracy .
And secondly , I 'm not going to give you any answer .
I prefer more questions .
And what I want to do is I think it 's a very recent view of this , which is -- is that openness is transparent to the trust of democracy .
I have a little lower .
All of these TED beings are optimistic .
And basically you all believe that complexity is something that does n't believe .
Believe you all already know me .
And research shows that we 're the most <unk> in the world .
<unk> magazine recently published a article about the recent recently research article called " Happiness , " which is " happiness , " and " <unk> " , and <unk> .
You know what will happen next to us , so let 's start with a story .
This is the day of a small country , and the sky is <unk> <unk> , of course , which can be your country .
Because the <unk> went down to the afternoon , and so four of them did n't want to <unk> <unk> .
They went out to vote .
When you see the <unk> , the three - thirds of the candidates are <unk> .
They do n't have the government .
Because before you know what you 're going to do is to negotiate .
You know who to catch down , who 's going to work .
But now , people do n't know what to do .
So governments decided to <unk> elections .
But it turns out that the <unk> citizens have the opposite of <unk> .
And basically , they 're all going to say that they feel <unk> .
This is a portrait of a beautiful novel called <unk> , which is called " I see . "
But my story is really good to capture the problems in Europe today .
From a certain way , none of the <unk> democracy is the best way of regulating democracy .
<unk> is the only way .
The problem is that a lot of people are starting to believe that democracy is not only the only way to focus .
In the last 30 years , political scientists look at the <unk> rate of people who are not interested in voting , that you think you 're going to benefit from voting .
That 's the poor person who did n't work without work .
That 's the problem .
Because , especially , as far as economic progress , you can see that people are already completely ignorant of democracy .
And according to the latest research in Europe , Europe <unk> thought that policy and public action is there .
There 's only about 15 percent of the Greeks who think vote is important .
People are starting to think , they 're going to get government , but help manage .
So what I want to ask is why , in a nice society , is a social society than ever before , a society that allows us to be free , to make our freedom of social societies that make us more information , but in love , it 's completely lost for democracy .
So what I really want to ask is , in this 50 years , our democracy is right .
Let 's start with the right thing .
To me , the first thing that 's really changed here is that the <unk> revolution has changed our lives and helps us think about democracy .
The first revolution was the cultural and social revolution in 1970 , and it brought people to the center of a political center .
That 's the moment of human rights .
This revolution is also a major breakthrough , a very diverse culture , an <unk> culture that we never had before .
All of the kids that I think were born like <unk> , although many of us had n't born yet .
But after that , you 've gone through the town in the ' 80s .
And even a lot of people hate it -- but in fact , the fact that the market revolution is , " The government does n't know much more . "
You have a social commitment .
And then , <unk> , the <unk> and the Cold War .
This is the beginning of globalization .
And then you have the Internet .
And I do n't want to tell you how much the Internet is going to give us power .
But the Internet changes the way we communicate , and we also have a vision of politics .
The idea of political groups has been transformed by the Internet .
I 'm going to talk about a revolution in the world , and it <unk> our way of understanding human decisions .
And so this is the map of the <unk> , and the Internet , in Europe , has developed in <unk> .
And this is the wrong thing to do , and that 's exactly what we 're going to end on .
Because you have the political and social revolution in 1960 , <unk> the idea of collective responsibility in a particular way .
And that idea is that all of the peoples that we 've learned about collective people , the families , families -- all disappear .
We started thinking about starvation , of course , if we were willing to marry .
All of these began to be attacked .
So when people are just trying to figure out what really matters , then we want to encourage them to engage in politics .
And then you have the perpetual authorities in the ' 80s , and you 've got the <unk> of social change .
As you know , the expansion of democracy has always fallen down to the end of the year .
And what happened was that the more social social society was growing .
It 's now out there .
Now , the expansion of democracy is always getting more <unk> .
Now , when I talk to people about democracy , what 's wrong is that I think it is <unk> .
And in <unk> , some of the things you normally think is the right thing to do , in fact , a lot of people tell you , " That 's the end of what the Cold War <unk> in the military and the public level . "
When you have a lot of money , it 's a rich man , because they do n't want to raise the <unk> .
Now , those people are completely shocked .
They can be flow , and you ca n't get normal .
They have a lot of money .
In the end , you 'll find a strange phenomenon that 's broken by voting .
This is not an accident , not a <unk> vote .
It 's about the Internet , and it 's connected to the world , but we also know that Internet <unk> is created , created the political community where you 're going to stand together and sit beside you .
You 'll notice that understanding and different people will be more difficult .
And I know a lot of people like to talk about the world , and the possibility of collaboration and collaboration , but whether you see the effects of the World Wide world ?
This is part of the Internet revolution .
This is what 's called a coin coin . "
And then you look at the brain political adviser , and then what you learn from scientists is not to talk about the way that ideas do n't talk to me .
For them , what 's really important to really control people is what really matters .
And you can feel intense feeling today in some way , even if you see what we 're talking about , the revolution is called <unk> or ideas .
In the past , the revolution is <unk> .
They could be <unk> , and they can be libertarian or <unk> .
In fact , they are called the media .
You see Facebook Revolution , Twitter Revolution .
The content is not important , and the problem is that media is the media .
I mean , one of my main ideas is that it 's the right thing to be wrong .
When we try to figure out how we can change what we 're trying to see , we have to get something to do with democracy .
Because maybe those are the most important things that we 're most <unk> about .
Now this is a very fashionable view of what you love to quantify , so that serious civic , new citizens and new technologies are connected to the trust of the politics .
You believe that , when you have new technologies and to use the new technology of technology , you can do something better for governments to avoid government , who want to get rid of the government .
Maybe you 're right .
But I think that we should be able to get to the center of the city to move into politics , and the political is always trying to <unk> .
So transparent and transparent trust trust .
<unk> is just about political authority , which is a way of trust .
And we 're just talking about our social society , which is based on the basis of <unk> .
By the way , " No trust " for democracy .
That 's why we have illegal laws .
Why do we have these things that created this " non - <unk> " between those who represent what they represent .
But when the political is just a way to manage it as managing " <unk> " -- I 'm very happy about that -- and I 'll just revert to <unk> .
It does n't turn into a show of entertainment , and we 're going to be looking at the <unk> of the other person to look at it .
Is this free social rights ?
For example , you have to imagine that when the great civic citizens have been involved , if they really think politics is going to manage it .
You 're not afraid of the technology of these technologies ? These technologies are going to try to figure out what 's going on for a certain problem , because it 's more important for the politicians to think about it , so that even if it 's wrong , they 're not afraid , you do n't have a sense of <unk> .
Now , I 'm sitting in the middle of this room , and you 're not afraid of your president , is that you 're never going to make a difference when you 're participating in someone who is participating .
And the reason I think it is , because democracy is going to change the opinions of the citizens in the world , according to <unk> .
But if we 're going to give up this idea of political change , the political politics becomes a <unk> for the citizens , and we do n't forgive the politicians .
So for me , this is critical .
I do believe that when we talk about politics , maybe the story is evolving .
But do n't forget , anything else , but also a <unk> .
No matter what our government wants to open up , they just want to have the green open open design .
In a small country , of course , it might be your country -- and they ask -- this is a real story -- all the government decisions are discussing the end of the day to talk about the end .
It 's about the public .
So when I had the opportunity to communicate with the Prime Minister , I asked him why they decided to be so nurturing .
And the Prime Minister says , " Listen , it 's only that way to <unk> people .
Because when they know about 24 hours a day , all of the conversation has to be open , and they have to get close enough , or if they 're going to get <unk> .
So , when we talk about mobile systems , as we discuss openness , I think we have to survive the right and wrong .
<unk> , non - <unk> , not political , they said , " The better place in the 19th century , the more <unk> . "
Thank you .
<unk>
Filmmaker <unk> <unk> talks about the film , and showing some footage of her documentary , " War Show " by the war in Iraq .
entertainment , film , global issues , storytelling , technology , war

<unk> <unk> and her war
Three years ago , I came up with a telephone , and I was doing a film that I could tell you about <unk> <unk> .
I had this experience in <unk> , and I was excited , because this telephone .
I was thinking , I 've just finished a film about World War II , and I realized that I had to dig up their stories , realizing that this is the opportunity to tell a story story .
And I was very excited about that night .
A lot of the details do n't know , but still .
There was no <unk> in the morning , but it was more like midnight .
My name is <unk> . Yves , <unk> , <unk> .
So I had this idea : Why do n't I actually do that ? Mate with soldiers ?
So what does it tell you from <unk> ?
And so I went back to the phone , and I was the defender of the <unk> army .
He understood me , and I said , " Greg ? "
And he said , " Excuse me , what ? "
I talked about my own thoughts , and you know , he 's the most <unk> of the world , like <unk> , who eventually gave me the opportunity to try .
I went to <unk> .
And he proposed my choice for free .
I picked a team -- <unk> <unk> , three of the founders of Charlie , and they are <unk> -- two reasons .
First , they 're oppressed .
Secondly , their reputation in <unk> , and I knew that there could be the Internet .
And I could n't believe that it had to make these soldiers mobilized .
This is important . I do n't think I 'm going to tell you when it comes to me when I 'm going to show you a little bit about the <unk> .
And so that means , when I went to <unk> , I 'm going to walk down in the <unk> , and I 'm going to jump down in a row and tell my idea .
You can imagine different questions like <unk> <unk> .
And the best question is , " You know , you know about the country . "
I went from <unk> Island to <unk> , and I talked about the war in <unk> .
It 's about nine minutes per year .
So I want to show you one clip .
It 's our <unk> , because I know you 're all very busy -- many people do n't see it .
So I want to show you <unk> , and I 'll just take a picture of it .
Can we start ?
<unk> : I 'm Stephen <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm Michael <unk> .
<unk> : Am I going to go ? Maybe not .
<unk> : We 're not supposed to talk to the media .
I 'm not the media . Damn !
And we 're going to change that .
That 's not what it is , society ! Are you ready ?
<unk> : Yeah ? Iraq , we 've got !
And every soldier would go to war .
This is nature .
If you 're afraid , that 's what you do .
Every time you go , you have damage .
It 's amazing .
Hey , <unk> , your <unk> .
<unk> . Are we being rejected ?
Somebody had been rejected . Somebody was rejected .
Keep on . Social , you want to work ?
<unk> wife : There is nothing to do with kids .
These little kids have been stuck in the war .
<unk> : At first , his meaning is , " <unk> something . "
George Bush : The latest democracy in the world .
They shoot for me .
You do n't have to send 15 military personnel and claim that we 're to build democracy .
<unk> : We 're headed to the window now to see " Larry King . "
We come to the money .
I have to support Bush . We do n't go to the oil .
<unk> : My worst thing in my life .
<unk> : <unk> , wait , man .
He completely changed .
And I did .
<unk> : We 're trying to help people -- but we just kill one .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> , and Howard has been rejected ?
They 're there ! That 's it ! <unk> , fire !
And 20 years later , it 's going to become a better country because we 're born .
I hope that .
<unk> : Thank you .
And I also have one thing to talk to you about a very difficult question .
I think that 's the experience of a TED experience .
I do n't know how many people you might think it was , but there was a TED person coming back from Iraq .
Paul ? Quick . Okay .
This is Paul <unk> .
And he 's in -- -- the Navy 's cutting , I want to tell you a little story .
We 're one of those people who can be able to get into the <unk> , with <unk> glasses and using using <unk> software .
Right ? And then we started talking about it .
People came from my tag , and they saw the " War Game , " so we started talking about war .
There are other people who are talking to us and others .
I mean , we talked about a hour .
And it really <unk> some of the things I want to think of , and I hope you 're going to be able to do a lot of people .
Actually , because maybe we do n't applaud .
It makes us feel comfortable .
How do we do that , actually , a dialogue ?
And Paul 's talking , and he 's going to go down and say , " You know , if you do n't have her , I wo n't talk to me because I know she will support me . "
And I said , I was very nervous .
Because I always used to use it .
And I actually said to James yesterday , because I 'm standing behind the camera .
You know , I can answer the question of the film , but if you let me go down to 18 minutes , that 's really exhilarating .
So I said , " Paul , I 'm happy to be here , because I know you support me . "
This film and the Web does n't have a whole film , but if you did n't do the Internet .
That 's the average average of those people who had two weeks to get me from Iraq to me .
Meanwhile , fighters -- we can email and talk about the moment .
I do n't have all of it because I did n't realize what I would like to do that .
But there was no email and <unk> , and the text was broken down .
And the reason I quantify it is that we 're going to think of it as an act of interaction .
So I want to show you one clip , and I 'll tell you a little bit about how it 's going to be done .
Let 's start .
We 're going to die today .
We need to give them a fair opportunity .
So what we 're going to do is take the next step .
Because , obviously , we have an advantage . I 'm just kidding .
And we 're going to <unk> the windows to move out of the window .
It 's not true . Very dangerous .
Wow .
<unk> : That 's there .
Okay , we 've got to go there .
When you look at it , we 're leaving the <unk> .
We think it 's going to happen in <unk> , and we 're going to go into that place .
<unk> : That mother is a car bomb !
<unk> : These people !
<unk> : Put your <unk> on !
Hey , go there -- yeah .
Anyone , four <unk> of the door .
<unk> , or any one , immediately quickly jump through the door , and a few weeks later .
Guy : I got out of you .
It 's too low . It goes down .
Take your glasses . Get your toes !
It 's a lot of <unk> .
About 20 people die , at least 20 or 30 <unk> injuries .
It 's like -- you know , a guy , with a pair of coins through a pencil , it looks like a <unk> wound .
Everything was thrown away , like a hole crossing .
This is <unk> 's face .
And they 've just got rid of the <unk> toes , and they 've got the toes of <unk> <unk> .
There 's no reason I 'm going to be there .
This is blood vessel .
You know , walk down , you can hear the sound of the skin .
These are all these things .
I remember <unk> a few months old .
The soldiers sat up in the corner of the police corner , and they 're going to die .
<unk> are being lost , not <unk> injury .
And I heard about these people who do n't work in <unk> .
They can work with jobs , but they ca n't die there .
They had to die .
And if those useless <unk> were told me to stop the treatment , I had to cut his throat .
And the night is that we 're trying to figure out what 's going on in the head , whether we want .
<unk> : There are more <unk> in Iraq .
The same car bombing happened to eight percent of the death rate , and the population injury was over the north coast of Virginia .
We 've got news .
I feel proud of it .
I lost faith in media -- it 's more like a poor joke , I 'm not talking about it .
And I 'm not sure that I 'll get a <unk> back .
And I 'll do that , and I 'll let you go .
Because the paper is <unk> , and it 's going to have a little bit of time to get your airplane back tomorrow .
Another task , six on the morning .
<unk> : Yeah . Thank you .
I talked about it before , trying to tell a story , rather than <unk> -- Chris , in his very intimate discussion , this convergence .
It 's a new attempt to make CDs .
When I met these soldiers , 10 people <unk> for me , and then there was 21 people involved in the record .
That 's five soldiers fighting .
And there are three kinds of people who are doing important things in the film .
I was sending me from <unk> <unk> to my email , and I found that <unk> photo of the <unk> in the car .
The opposite of the email is clearly , obviously , very bad day .
And I found dust in my <unk> window on the site .
So I turned off the door , and I said , " Hey , can you just interview the <unk> ? "
Because part of the thing we do n't often have is the military word called " <unk> . "
That 's the beginning of the event , and you know .
And if you put it in the past , it 's <unk> and <unk> with the <unk> .
I 'm really hungry for me .
So , in order to be able to understand , to share with you , these people -- the most stunning two people on the board -- and there 's a camera there -- <unk> , <unk> .
Most of them have two cameras .
So you 're actually experiencing experience in the first time .
And the interview that you saw earlier was recorded 24 hours during the events of events .
Yves <unk> went home in his five months to read his <unk> .
I know <unk> , but it 's very , very <unk> .
And you know , you won the trust of others , especially in the CDs .
And so he went back to five months after he goes to the age of five months .
So , I was able to put the news video in <unk> -- you know , and I think the mainstream media can do the best .
But I know people always hear , " Why do n't they tell us what we do ? "
Okay , so that 's a good example .
The <unk> and the other one is outside the day .
They do n't stop .
There was no American population there .
They 're outside the day , and they 're working on <unk> -- those are jobs in the <unk> of <unk> .
So when you listen to the soldiers , this is why , right ?
And I think they can share these things , which is the best gift of communication .
And in many of these questions , I feel that the <unk> are so spontaneous .
But you do n't want to know more about it , or you can hear it .
And I was like , I do n't think -- I think , you know , different people talk about the world , and I 'm worried about this in a different way .
We have to go into something that we think is so dangerous .
But we just need little communication to understand .
That 's actually true .
For me , it 's trying to kill this <unk> .
I 'll share a story .
And in -- I 'm often asked , you know , the most special moment in the process of making this film .
After the boat , it was -- you know , I agree with you all the time -- so many people would want to ask all sorts of questions .
The first question is , " Oh , what do you use ? "
Or that 's the same problem .
But there 's always a few people , almost every time , they 're going to ask .
And I know that these people are always hungry .
They always get out of it .
For me , the most profound story for me to tell me about my story , is -- for some of the people who do n't see the movies , it 's not a good thing -- a lot of <unk> -- that 's very popular .
In the film , there 's a shot of a Iraq woman who is killed .
A soldier came up beside me , and the plants , you can imagine , very close -- from my feet .
He was a big kid .
And he looked at me and I <unk> , and then I saw him all over the beginning .
He did n't have a clue .
And she said , " My god is <unk> . "
I know what he 's going to say .
<unk> was <unk> .
They often <unk> their kids .
Kids get tired from the kids , so it 's a lot of time .
And then he said , " I 've got a child .
I 'm a dad , and I have kids .
I ca n't tell my wife .
I worried that she thinks I 'm a beginner . "
I gave him a <unk> , and so I said , " You know , you know . "
And then he said , " I 'll bring her to the documentary .
And I 'm going to <unk> her . "
So I 'm talking about <unk> , not only about those people who do n't know the soldiers , and you know , it 's not like World War II , which is the bottom line and the <unk> .
You could n't feel that life , but there was no war in it .
And I heard people say , they might know that I did this film , and they said , " Oh , you know , I 'm against war , but I have to support these soldiers . "
And I started asking them , " Oh , that sounds good -- what do you do ?
Will you go to the United States ?
Are you going to get some people ?
Are you -- if you find your neighbors , you have to spend time with them ?
Not a question , just to stay together , look at whether they want to go ?
Will you license any charity ? "
You know , obviously this remarkable job of Dean Kamen -- but you can use a lot of charity for many of the bankers , helping alleviate soldiers .
And I think I 'm going to ask you to -- to give you the support of the community , right ?
Are you their friends ?
Are you really concerned about ?
I want to say that my hope is , I ask you , <unk> , you know .
<unk> a <unk> .
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> is n't serious about <unk> -- <unk> <unk> .

<unk> <unk> sings " <unk> "
That 's the evil of science , so I think it 's perfect .
<unk> , who is my uncle ? -- who 's going to be my favorite love for me ? Why am I looking at the <unk> of the neighborhood , and , you know , " <unk> " -- and we 've got a lot of <unk> in the world , but we do n't have a <unk> for the rest of what I 've been doing , which is that our kids are <unk> by <unk> and <unk> that we have <unk> <unk> -- that 's a good thing to do with the people who are , we 're
" I love myself . "
It 's expanding . I think you 're <unk> . You 're my <unk> <unk> , thank you .

Kevin <unk> says radical <unk> -- we 're familiar with carbon - and - <unk> emissions in the lower <unk> of <unk> and building <unk> , and he shows a group from <unk> <unk> .
architecture , business , demo , design , green , invention , technology

Kevin <unk> on <unk>
What 's going on ?
<unk> makes incredible .
Obviously , this is the polar bear that we 're familiar with , and this will be very quick , maybe just three or four or five years later . Very glamorous ! Very scary .
So we 're all thinking about what we can do .
When we see CO2 in the world , <unk> and <unk> are about building buildings .
And so the interesting thing is , it 's only about the car .
And we came up with some sushi .
And in this sushi scene we have a great idea .
It was called an ecology .
We 're going to be able to redefine the <unk> of the history of <unk> , which produces 200 <unk> per year .
So this is a great idea . We want to get 80 percent of the foundation . That 's what we 've done .
We started developing development in 2006 .
And then I decided to extract from the Jim <unk> of the concrete and the olives .
This is our laboratory . We did n't show it .
But our members have to try to get about 5,000 different kinds of <unk> to find the best <unk> for us .
They really are very , very interesting .
And then we 've got to build the curve in China .
Unfortunately , we 're going to do this in the U.S.
In summer , we have all the <unk> of the box .
We 're beginning to start .
And you 're going to see a whole new thing about the <unk> line that is completely discarded .
That 's what we did .
That 's the first two - year anniversary of <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> on cardboard .
The most exciting thing is , look at these people 's faces .
They worked on this project for three years .
They 're so excited . That 's the first time for <unk> .
And our operation is that our cars are actually hungry here , obviously , that he 's very , very excited .
That will be huge impacts in the environment .
And after a few weeks we 've done the <unk> of <unk> , which is the first time you 've got the name of your name .
This is a product that goes on by Alexander .
We 've been working on a year in the <unk> of " <unk> , " the New York era , <unk> <unk> .
Thank you , thank you .
This is what we 've learned . 8,000 gallons of gas to build a house .
Maybe you 're not very sure , it 's like driving around the Earth .
We have to change everything .
Look at our rooms , chairs , <unk> , all of us have to change the question , otherwise we ca n't solve this problem .
Please do n't listen to anyone around you , because everyone can do it .
We will provide " <unk> " for <unk> .
We have an alternative company , and we 're building it around the country .
We 're going to speed it up .
<unk> carbon - <unk> is about 250 cars , which we already know , right ?
So what do you do ? I 'll tell you what I do and why I 'm going to do it .
This is my kid , <unk> and David .
When they have their own kids in 2050 , they 'll look at the Palestinian and say , " Hey , you 're doing good things with your team . "
So I hope you leave the TED , and please think of your carbon emissions and try to do everything .
You do n't know how to do it , please . I 'll help you .
And finally , Bill Gates , I know you 've invented the system .
This is what we 've invented next year .
Thank you for listening .

Imagine a surgery who does n't have to move the <unk> . In TEDMED , <unk> shares a technology by using <unk> MRI , and focused on <unk> , who cares for the brain , with <unk> cancer and <unk> tumors .
health care , medical research , medicine , science , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : <unk> surgery -- <unk>
In the last 13 years -- three , 27 years of <unk> -- one of the great teams in Israel that I 'm referring to .
This is what I want to talk about .
There are some of you who are 13 years old .
For me , it 's like the second adult transplant .
And this dream of the challenge is two major technologies combined .
One is focused on the other , and one is the visual MRI technique .
First of all , focus on attention .
I 'm a <unk> model .
It 's made out of buildings .
And <unk> , you 're not going to show you .
In fact , it 's full fully transparent .
Now we 're going to go into the lab .
You can see the <unk> in the <unk> .
This is my device in my physical lab .
There is a <unk> sensor on the right .
When the <unk> sensors were released on the inside of the model .
You 've heard about the energy that is energy , and you 're going to have a little amount of damage inside of you .
It 's all around us .
The damage is made from inside the inside .
Think about it if this is your brain .
We 're going to get part of the brain .
We can do that in no non - organizing situations .
And I think that 's the first <unk> - <unk> <unk> system .
Next to <unk> ultrasound .
You all know about ultrasound .
<unk> <unk> on <unk>
But <unk> can become anything else , because it 's a mechanical force .
It 's a <unk> of force .
So you can use the intensity of change , functional and flexible , to create something that does n't come from anything from <unk> to anything .
<unk> : What I 'm going to show you is to focus on multiple applications in the field of <unk> , in medical attention .
<unk> contracts , <unk> <unk> is not glamorous .
This idea was formed before I was born , like <unk> brothers and <unk> <unk> , which was developed by inventing <unk> .
But you do n't know that early in the ' 80s , he tries to use attention to <unk> , and he 's trying to get <unk> <unk> .
No success , he invented the <unk> .
So you think about why they 're not successful .
Because some of the key things are <unk> and use .
They lack of <unk> technology .
And until the invention of <unk> MRI , we have the answer to <unk> ultrasound , and we can have an answer in a supercomputer and a physicist who can do it completely without <unk> , completely bodies .
This is what the future of the future looks like today .
This is a magnetic field of <unk> ultrasound , <unk> <unk> .
I 'll show you some examples .
The first is in the brain .
You can understand one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> or <unk> .
And the typical symptoms of this disease are like <unk> <unk> , which is eating olives , and when you 're eating the glasses , the <unk> are all over the place , or the words that have no attention to the help of other people .
Let me show you John .
John <unk> is a retired student from Australia .
There are two years of <unk> .
<unk> healing .
A lot of the patients refused surgery because they needed <unk> .
About six months ago , he received a <unk> treatment .
This is a cure for the <unk> of the National <unk> Association of <unk> , who is the clinical lining - <unk> expert in the U.S.
This is his uncle .
If you look at the <unk> , " six <unk> ' 2011 " 2011 . "
This is what he did before his <unk> <unk> , and I 'm going to take you on the process of demonstrating the typical surgery process that is non - <unk> surgery .
We 're going to <unk> patients with the <unk> <unk> .
You can use sensors that are different from the brain , if you 're other organs , other structures .
And the doctors will start with the <unk> MRI .
What about the scans ?
I 've never been able to make a mistake , but what do you see here ?
This is a very <unk> region .
This is the safe area around the target .
This is the surgery of the <unk> .
And as soon as you get rid of those images , the doctors come up all the time , and then he 's going to take the point -- that 's the dot , which is <unk> -- and he says , " <unk> <unk> . "
And we packaged the <unk> energy , which is called " <unk> <unk> . "
The only <unk> is moving the mouse .
And the mouse is only the only device he had in his treatment .
He 's following the " <unk> . "
If you look at sensors , you see the <unk> .
The head is water between water .
<unk> released energy .
It 's increasing temperature .
We have to recognize whether the goal is <unk> .
So the first time that <unk> <unk> is lower .
It does n't have any harm to raise the temperature .
A unique functionality of functional <unk> is the non - <unk> measurements .
This is a special feature of <unk> .
They 're not going to be <unk> by the military .
But we can use the <unk> image and the temperature of the heat <unk> .
And you can see the dots .
temperature has been recycled to 43 degrees centigrade .
This does n't have any harm .
But the point is that we do that .
And when the doctors answered <unk> , the goal is to look at the importance of purpose , and that 's where the <unk> enters the next step , and this is what it is , it 's going to fall out of the way , right ?
temperature rises to 55 degrees to 66 .
If this state continued to continue , it 's basically enough to kill protein .
This is the <unk> of the patient , and it 's the end of the day .
The <unk> immediately disappears .
Thank you .
John <unk> is one of the winners and <unk> of this research .
What you need to know is what they do when they decide what to do .
And John wrote this after John .
He said , " It 's amazing . "
His wife said , " This is the happiest moment in my life . "
Maybe you did n't understand it .
And what I want to say is why are we going to maintain the quality of life ?
These people have lost their own lives .
They want to depend on other people .
John <unk> does n't have to do it .
He <unk> normal life .
He would go to <unk> , like a lot of people living in Australia .
Okay , look at the fog .
It 's about three <unk> in the middle .
There 's no turning injury .
He did n't have any nerves .
There did n't have to be a <unk> before .
He <unk> directly to the normal life .
We want to talk about a pain .
<unk> can make life terrible .
And people have <unk> all sorts of pain , things like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> cancer , and when the cancer moves into your bone , sometimes it 's very , very painful .
I talked about this kind of stuff that has been proven very rapidly to be able to cure how to eliminate the pain that 's going to break out of pain .
So I want to talk about <unk> .
He 's a farmer who 's <unk> , and his pain comes from .
His cancer grew up to the side of the city , and even if there 's a drug , he ca n't sit down .
He stopped anything .
<unk> the most advanced <unk> , but not help .
A lot of patients tend to die .
But he decided to engage the most significant research project in the world , and certainly the U.S.
That 's his wife .
They 've got about three hours from the farm .
And he 's going to sit in a hallway , and it does n't have to move any harm .
And he received his prescription and he could steer the truck .
And again , it 's going to stop the pain again .
And you can feel that when you get <unk> , these patients feel like their families .
And he began to start in the farm every day .
He 's three seconds old .
The <unk> went to the house .
It 's all very good .
But now you ask me , what 's the recipe for cancer ?
We need to look at those ones who are ones .
How do you do this research ?
There 's good news , too bad .
The good news is that we can do a lot of it .
This is a country that has <unk> in the U.S.
But in the U.S.
Very glamorous .
It does n't seem to be the <unk> of the nation , but it 's a nation - based goal , and it 's not going to get me wrong .
This is not just the question of institutions , but it 's a very large amount of money that 's going to work in the scale and the size of the brain , and so on .
The first two uses of research is breast cancer and cancer .
These two are first cancer , first of all , for <unk> ultrasound .
<unk> cancer is much better than the surgery .
But it 's a news for the men .
You heard about the <unk> of prostate cancer yesterday yesterday .
By using <unk> MRI and <unk> ultrasound , we have a new cure because we can think of prostate cancer -- <unk> <unk> , which does n't have to paste on the world , and do n't avoid the entire <unk> and the problem .
Some of the other ones , in <unk> cancer -- very fatal , <unk> cells , liver liver , kidneys .
And the difficulty of <unk> is that the patient is completely <unk> in all of our <unk> , and it 's hard to talk to doctors -- that 's why we have to make the MRI <unk> <unk> .
It 's not easy .
We spent two years .
Now there 's a news to chocolate now .
In 2004 , the American FDA has approved the search for the <unk> of <unk> ultrasound .
Women are afraid of <unk> .
And the tumor will cause a lot of noise in a lot of noise .
Sometimes they do n't even <unk> .
This woman lives in France .
She was diagnosed with long - scale <unk> , and she was a <unk> - sized toy .
This is a huge toy .
And the doctors suggested she 's going to take the <unk> , but for the people who expect to do it , it 's not acceptable .
She took care of it in 2008 .
She became a healthy mother in 2010 .
So this is a new life .
And I want to leave you with four information .
First of all , to think about non - <unk> surgery can allow the patient to help their family , communities , community , social control -- and I think it 's the cost of doctors and emotions -- I want to do that .
In other words , imagine a new relationship between the brain , when the patient lies down , he 's totally <unk> , and even if it 's a <unk> .
In our <unk> , the patient 's patients had a surgery .
The patient could n't stop .
And then I 'd like to thank you , and I 'll thank you for listening .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> says , " <unk> film , music and software , almost not to get rid of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and in the world , she talked about all the creative industries that you can learn from the skin .
business , creativity , culture , design , hack , media , media
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : A free culture from the flat
I heard about the magic story about <unk> <unk> .
She 's a <unk> designer .
She went to a friend of her friends in Paris .
She 's all over the place of <unk> , and she found this <unk> coat . She loves it .
She saw the coat <unk> .
She was looking at the <unk> of the clothing and the coat .
And her friends said , " Keep on . "
She said , " I 'll buy it , but I have to copy it . "
Now , the scholars are probably thinking , " This is like a copy . "
But , for a long time , it 's actually a symbol of <unk> <unk> , which is that she can find an historic history that does n't make a difference , a kind of a romantic coat .
You might want to ask her whether she does n't make a difference .
But it actually turns out to be legal .
In the fashion industry , there 's no intellectual property of protection .
They have the power of <unk> , but not the wetlands , and no patents have no patents .
They have only the logo to protect it , so it means that every person can replicate this , anyone can wear anything like their design .
It 's only the same thing that they ca n't replicate , and that 's the fact that that 's the fact that it 's embedded inside the <unk> .
That 's why we see the customer in all these products .
And that 's because of the artist 's artists , copying those very hard , because they do n't copy their noise .
But if you go to <unk> , right ?
Ah , yes .
Yves Street , I know .
Sometimes those are fun .
Now , based on this reason , this fashion industry does n't have a lot of reason because it 's because of a long period of time , it 's a long time to decide how to get rid of it .
They do n't want to make a few designers in our <unk> <unk> .
And then the rest of the people will have to get this <unk> or the <unk> approval , because <unk> had to get it .
But is it very glamorous ? How do you think about the equator ?
This is <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
We might think it 's too stupid . It 's very stupid .
Now , you 're not going to see the logic of no <unk> <unk> , which is very familiar with the <unk> of the building , that might also be an amazing success and the economy of this industry .
And today , I 'm angry with my anger , not microwave , flat designers , actually have the ability to use the design of the <unk> , <unk> our bodies , to <unk> the body .
Because in this industry there is no <unk> , so there 's a very open ecology of creation and creation .
<unk> to do the same thing with them , <unk> or <unk> , or musician , and they 're different from all of the design designers .
They can come from any kind of clothing in any fashion history , and then they <unk> them into their design .
They are also governed by the beginning of iteration .
And here , I suspect , they are the influence of the <unk> .
Maybe just a little bit .
You ca n't get the copyright <unk> .
Now , Steve designers have made the most broad spaces in this industry .
This <unk> is actually made by thumb and <unk> , and it 's actually actually using aluminum glasses .
And I heard when you go out , it sounds like a <unk> .
So <unk> is a mysterious side of this culture , which is essentially what it is .
People think this is a mystery , how does it happen ?
This , because people replicate are legal .
Some people believe that there are two people on the top of the sphere , and these people decide that we 're going to zoom in in a certain way , but if you compare any of any art conversations , it 's the best designers , they 're often saying that their aspiration is from the streets and the people who are in the street and connecting people to <unk> and interact with you .
And that 's where they really get a lot of inspiration . So it 's also a <unk> - <unk> industry .
Now , quickly , high - scale <unk> , probably because of the fashion sector does n't have a microwave campaign ; they have the largest benefits .
They 're because they 're <unk> , and they are sold to Facebook .
And they have a lot of lawsuits , but those are the dimensions of the fashion designers usually not win the loyalty .
<unk> has been <unk> over and over again , " You do n't need knowledge . "
When you look at this kind of stuff , you want to know , how do you live in business ?
If you can say 200 feet , you have a thousand dollars .
That 's why we 've done a few years ago at the University of Alabama .
We invited <unk> <unk> , and that meetings called " Sharing : " and we asked him this question .
That 's what he said .
He was just doing a very short job of the CEO of <unk> designers who did n't know what you did .
<unk> : And we 've found that a lot of research , in fact , is n't very much studied , and it 's very easy to buy customers that are n't our customers .
<unk> : Imagine that .
It 's not going to be shopping in <unk> .
It 's a very difficult population .
And you know , a copy is never going to be the same for the original design , at least in the materials , they normally use cheap materials .
But sometimes there is a cheap version of it that can actually be able to get a little bit of a certain amount of life inside a dead .
There 's a lot of good faces .
A lot of culture is about one of the things that we have now , and we now have a much more <unk> version of what we already have . This is actually because this rapid fashion industry .
And this is a good thing , I need more options .
<unk> , whatever you do , help you on the world to show you .
Because quickly fashion , the global estimate is actually better than the past .
And this is the good news for the progress of progress , and they 're hoping that progress is going to move into the product .
For people , they want to stay on the curve .
They do n't want to be the same .
So they want to move forward quickly to the next level .
And I tell you , fashion does n't stop .
And every season , those designers have to think about a good idea for everybody .
And I 'm going to tell you that , let 's tell you a lot about the bottom .
Now , of course , there 's a range of effects that are involved in the process of creation .
<unk> is a very successful pair of shoes .
He complained about his design . But before I read it , he said , you know , this <unk> him .
And he had to think about the new <unk> , and it 's not easy to come up with new things .
And he came up with this leopard <unk> that had to be done or <unk> , and if you use some cheaper materials , it would have two and a half minutes .
It <unk> more innovation .
And that actually made me remember <unk> , great Charlie Parker .
I do n't know whether you hear this story . But I 've heard it .
And he says he 's invented one reason he was very , very sure that white musician had no ability to replicate this sound .
And he wanted it to get rid of it , and that 's exactly what computation designers are doing .
They try to put it together , and this is a <unk> that can reflect them .
When people <unk> , everyone knows that they look at the runway , and it 's a clear <unk> .
I love these <unk> .
Okay , I 'm going to move forward .
This is different from comedy .
I do n't know if you know about romantic <unk> .
So when a rock is very popular , everyone <unk> each other .
But now we have a different <unk> .
They 're developing the remix , a <unk> pattern , which is like fashion designers .
And their joke that they are , like fashion designers , really just just in this aesthetic sense .
If somebody is <unk> with a pair of Israeli David -- as example , rather than <unk> .
Now , the other thing that 's going to happen now is that there are other things that we have to survive in this kind of <unk> culture , where they 've learned how to fix them .
They replicate their own stuff .
They 're working with high - scale <unk> , and they 're trying to sell their product to a new population .
Now some fashion designers are going to say , " We just have n't been respected in America .
In other countries , we 're deeply motivated to be protected . "
But if you look at the other two of the largest markets in the world , you 'll find that they serve it to be real , really practical .
It 's about Japanese , I think it 's the world 's three - big market , and they have the design principle , which is protected , but it is a huge amount of standards , you have to prove that your clothing are n't there . It is completely unique .
And this little bit of <unk> standards in the United States is that designers have never seen this patent , which is rarely done here .
And in the European Union , they go to another direction .
Very low standards , anyone can obtain anything .
But even though it 's rapid developed , you have a lot of <unk> here , and they do n't usually register their <unk> .
And this is because of the standard standard <unk> .
One person can come out of the other person 's <unk> , three feet away from the Mississippi , and then <unk> a new , primitive design .
So , that way to stop <unk> artists .
If you look at what 's going on in Europe , it 's a lot of stuff that is registered in Europe .
It 's <unk> <unk> , which is almost the same .
But it does n't stop the <unk> von <unk> .
She 's the chief of the American Museum of American art , and she tells her her <unk> to the forest .
Even though it 's already filled with this idea .
And I think that law does n't work in any place , because they realize that a legal remix and some of the difference between the world is just a part of something that is <unk> .
Who has a model ?
That 's a very difficult answer .
It needs a lot of lawyers and lots of people who have been so expensive .
You know , not just the Grand Canyon .
There 's a lot of other industries that do n't have a microwave stalk .
You ca n't get a recipe for a liberal force because it is a fact that it 's true . And , you can not get the mouth of this pump , even the most functional <unk> .
<unk> .
No matter how bizarre it looks like it does n't look like this , and you ca n't get the copyright leaders of this <unk> .
It 's a <unk> thing , which is why .
And the furniture is the same thing . It 's <unk> .
Now , magic , I think they 're <unk> , like <unk> . There is no copyright proposed .
<unk> , without microwave .
<unk> design , they decided they do n't do the trees .
They think no non - <unk> can be more innovation .
<unk> copyright is really hard .
The artist , they do n't want rights rights , that 's not cool .
They share their design .
<unk> , without microwave .
<unk> . <unk> taste , no .
These are some of the things that are going to look like you 're not , but those are the low - tech stores of <unk> , which is no genetically <unk> . And there 's a marketing film and a book .
Not very glamorous .
So you <unk> people who say , " <unk> ! "
Do n't tell anyone I can do a design for people , actually .
This is <unk> . "
But you know what ? This is the revolution . It 's a lot of other industries that we 've just seen .
Because , now , those are the dimensions of the microwave industry , and they do n't know what to do .
And when I found that there was a lot of industry , I thought , well , what does this mean ?
I need a picture , and the lawyers do n't offer it . So I did a .
These are some of the subjects of two <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
It 's more complex than that , but it can be .
First , what 's art ?
And it 's worth protecting .
Is it <unk> ?
It 's not , it does n't have to be protected .
This is a difficult and weak term .
The other thing is , is it a belief ?
Is n't it free in free societies ?
It 's not protected .
Or , for the laws of physics , it 's a kind of a <unk> argument , some people do something , and they have to have a little bit of <unk> , but the sacrifice .
The problem is that digital technologies have become completely dominated by the laws of nature .
Now , we do n't really think that books are things like <unk> , or music , that we can take the physical object .
It 's a digital document .
It 's just a physical physical aspect of us .
And these things , because we can be easily <unk> and spread , actually , in our culture , like <unk> , it 's like an idea .
Now , the idea is really profound when you talk about innovation and nurture , and let 's tell you that we do n't want the question to solve the lawyers .
They were smart .
I know someone here , he can .
He 's brilliant , he 's smart .
But you need a team of research for a long period of time , trying to decide , to try and solve what 's going on , and the world is going to lead innovation .
And I propose that <unk> can be really a good place for the future to start finding patterns .
If you want to know more about this research , please come to our website , it 's <unk> .
And then I really want to thank you to make this very fashionable picture of <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much .

Yves Behar demos the most ancient picture of the world , which is the brain of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of South Asia , and before we 've lived in South Africa , it 's a <unk> forest .

Yves <unk> : The oldest animal in the world
It 's a very strange crop called <unk> <unk> .
It looks like rocks on the sand , but it 's a <unk> that has hundreds of thousands of branches , and each <unk> has a little bit of <unk> in the <unk> -- and you can even stand up on top of the <unk> plants , you can even sit on the bottom of a <unk> plant , right ?
This plants lived in Chile , the <unk> Desert , historically .
It 's a very fast <unk> .
And in the last five years , I 've been doing this research on the world , and it 's also the old creatures that are still still alive , but they 're at least <unk> history or more years old .
This project has a part of art , which is the art .
There 's a certain amount of <unk> inside there .
And I 'm trying to look at a way to think about what 's going on at the beginning of what we 're thinking about .
I picked 2,000 years for the first time because I want to start looking at what 's going on in us when we think about it .
And what you 're seeing here is something called the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> in Japan .
<unk> is the difference I started doing .
I was traveling in Japan , and I did n't have anything else to do , when I heard about the history of <unk> , I knew I had to go there .
And then I went back to New York , and I thought about the idea of doing this project .
So this process is formed .
And I think it 's all about my wish to bring my interest to the art of art , and the philosophy of philosophy that makes me ready to be prepared when it comes to inspiration .
So I started working on the background , and I did n't believe that I had never done this thing , whether it was a <unk> or a scientific event .
And , of course , it might be quite surprising , and I found that it did n't have a kind of <unk> research in scientific research .
So what you 're seeing here is the map of <unk> , and it 's about 3,000 years of life in Greenland , where I 'm going to run these <unk> .
It 's not just traveling in Greenland , but not only in <unk> , not just in <unk> .
There 's a lot more <unk> than I 've ever experienced before .
Some special experiences also have a lot of experience .
And one day I went to a remote valley , and I found a few <unk> that were n't there .
And I ca n't email them or email to them , so I 'm really <unk> that I 've got .
But fortunately , obviously , I 've succeeded , but that 's an experience that has been deeply <unk> .
And after a few days we have a chance to go to the ice of a ice stream and fishing , and then there 's a lot of fish on the river where you 're going to get out of the water .
And that experience is like a very primitive period of time on Earth .
Let 's talk about this .
It takes 100 years to get a hundred years .
And I think that 's what makes human life in different ways .
What you 're seeing here is a picture of dust , and you see a picture of the <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> death rate , it sounds very glamorous .
<unk> <unk> is actually a <unk> fungus in the forest , and in a jungle region .
And people also <unk> called " <unk> , " because it is one of the largest creatures in the world .
And in a few studies of this kind of <unk> biologists , it 's a couple of maps of how many maps , some <unk> <unk> , started looking at the <unk> of death , looking for a circle that can kill the tree .
But I do n't know if this photo 's broken down , but I 'm sure it 's in the tree .
And then the surface of this , you can see that fungi are actually undermining <unk> .
These are white things that you see on the top of the tree , the <unk> and the wood of this <unk> , how it <unk> trees , and it 's actually going to <unk> the production of trees and nutrients and animals .
And this is the way that we have a lot of money on themselves , and it 's a history of <unk> .
And we 've seen it from the ground to the water .
This is the brain coral in the <unk> Sea , about 2,000 years old .
I had to overcome it to find it .
About six feet deep , about 18 meters .
You can see some of the brain corals on the surface .
This is because a group of <unk> ate a period of time . But fortunately , they lost interest in this brain coral .
Even more luckily , it does n't have the harm of the oil spill .
And so we 've all had to lose all the old creatures on Earth , and it 's still not the impact of our effects .
Now , I 'm going to show you one of the most <unk> organisms in the world .
It 's a <unk> bacterial vessel in the United States , and it 's about eight years of <unk> , which has been about eight years old .
It looks like a forest in the forest , actually .
And you can imagine that it 's a big filter of trees , and it 's just a cell tree that comes out of the trees .
So what you see here is a huge , <unk> , connected gene , which has already lived in <unk> .
And this is the male male <unk> , the theory of <unk> .
Now this is a <unk> tree .
It 's called <unk> <unk> , and it 's just a slight adolescent in the forest .
The reality of the <unk> is that it 's self - protected .
I told you about <unk> biologists , and he told me that we saw that in the middle , it was possible to see the <unk> of climate change .
As the ice goes up , the <unk> can change the change .
So we do n't have to compare them directly directly with these plants as well .
Now this is <unk> . I 'm just kidding . This is the Grand Canyon .
I 'm going to put this slide here because I 've asked anyone in my project .
The corals are outside , no animal .
Anybody know the biggest ice of the ages ? Anybody want to <unk> ?
Video : 300 , three - year - olds , 300 years old : Yeah , <unk> . That 's the old ice .
And also , you 've heard about a big anesthesia <unk> found that Iceland has been born at the <unk> .
But it died in the laboratory because it 's the age of our <unk> .
And I think the most interesting discovery is that it 's called <unk> jellyfish , looking at it at the beginning of the laboratory , to see the entire lifespan .
<unk> , no matter what jellyfish can survive in the natural environment .
Let 's go back to <unk> .
And you can see , she 's grown up in a church yard , and it 's in the <unk> . In a very clean way .
There 's some <unk> growing up in some church in Britain , but as you can see the math , it 's actually <unk> <unk> in those places , and then people are building the church .
Now look at another world .
And so I had the opportunity to have a chance to go to South Africa to have a <unk> expert in South Africa .
We saw a lot of <unk> , and this is the oldest .
About 2,000 . called <unk> <unk> .
And I think all of these creatures are <unk> .
They have a hundred years of history in their bodies , and they also reveal nature and human history .
<unk> is a very good example .
You can see the name of the <unk> tree , and it shows some natural events .
So when this tree grows , the central part of the tree is also <unk> , and the center of trees also become <unk> and flows .
This is a very good animal of animal , but they 're also used to be used in some non - <unk> places like <unk> , in the <unk> .
Now we 're going to look at another piece of work , which I think is , because it 's very glamorous .
This plants is called <unk> , and it only lives in the part of the country and the <unk> region , where it shows the functionality of a different amount of <unk> .
And it 's actually a tree .
It 's a primitive <unk> .
You notice it 's in the <unk> of <unk> .
And it looks like two <unk> of a pair of leaves that are just just dumped , and it 's a long - term desert environment that 's made of long <unk> .
These leaves never fall down , so there 's a whole range of leaves that have the longest leaves in the old <unk> .
I told you about biologists , <unk> <unk> , asking him that he thinks that this magic plant comes from , and he believes that if you 're killing Namibia , there 's a certain amount of islands that are pervasive , but it does n't have a lot of <unk> .
So he thinks that the expansion of the African region of Africa , the <unk> million years ago , did this mysterious <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which is this particular kind of urban climate .
And I think that 's the most ancient part of this .
This is the plants of the ground .
I told you about <unk> <unk> , who explains some of the special trees that have already adapted to this area of this region .
That area in the area of the <unk> <unk> , very dry , and it 's easy and easy to be swallowed by fire , so the way that trees do this is , you can think of it as the whole building , which is the Earth , that we can see that the entire chain of trees are covered on the ground .
So , when the cut - off injury is just the equivalent of a stroke .
The trees are very easily <unk> .
This is also the <unk> of the trees , the oldest old age .
And back to the United States , some of the older plants .
This is <unk> de <unk> <unk> , about 20 years old .
If you 're in the United States , all of you know about <unk> <unk> , you can see that this is a very strong round of circles .
The truth is that it 's slow to expand the first form of a form .
And it 's also a , again , a <unk> roots , which means that it is the same gene .
There 's a friend of mine around it , and I think they 're friends .
This is a <unk> <unk> , and it leaves about a mile away from almost a mile , and it 's <unk> .
You can see that it has similar shapes .
There are also some young ones that are <unk> in the back .
Both of them , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , lived in the land of the continent , and this is a lot of different kinds of difference between the city of protected the country .
In fact , this land is designed for fun .
Now I want to show you that probably the oldest living organism on Earth .
That 's <unk> , about 40 feet to 60 .
This bacteria is only found in a few years of discovery , and they found that they wanted to figure out how to find these planets on other planets , which is the most <unk> environment on Earth .
They did research for permanent <unk> , found this bacteria .
And what it is , is that it 's still a DNA <unk> .
That means that it does n't <unk> . It 's always about 50 million years long .
It might also be the most vulnerable creature that all the major organisms in the world are most <unk> , because if it 's permanent , it ca n't survive .
This is the map of the oldest living organism I put together , and so you can see that they 're going to see the distribution that 's spread around world .
The blue line is that I 've taken a picture of biology , and the red flag stands for me .
As you can see , in Antarctica .
I 'm ready to go there looking for <unk> , and it 's living in <unk> .
So , I 've got to leave this project for two years , or that project , but it 's about five years of experience , and I really understand the core of this job .
The most ancient living organism in the world is celebrate the past , which is a plea for the future of action .
They live for thousands of years to live in the desert , permanently , in <unk> or <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and human beings , but some of them are in the crisis , and they ca n't read it .
I hope , by looking for these creatures , I can draw them for their attention that they can make sure they 're going to be able to make progress in the future .
Thank you .
<unk>
We all want to have a meaningful life , but it 's starting to start ? In this fiery talk , <unk> <unk> talks about the story of " patient " and the other <unk> of the community , and in a certain kind of passion , all these sorts of other people who have inspired the people that inspired people .
culture , economics , global issues , investment
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : A <unk> life
I 've got a long period of time in the world , and I 've found that students or professionals , I find , all kinds of sounds like this , I hear the same sounds as well .
One thing , people say , " It 's going to change . "
They want to be a part of change .
They want to have a meaningful life .
But the other thing that I heard was that people were talking about fear , a wish to avoid risks .
And they say , " I 'm very excited about what 's going on , but I do n't know where to begin .
I do n't want my family or my friends . "
I work in this area .
Some of you would say , " I 'm going to do a job job , but my career is safe ?
Can I be <unk> people ?
Can I make enough money ?
Am I going to be a kid or not ? "
And I was a little bit of a lady who was lost at night , but I 'm very happy about it , and I did n't have a kid and then I looked at these young people , I would say , " Your job is not a perfect person .
You can just become a real person .
There is nothing important about life .
These dialogue reflects what 's happening in the state and the international level .
Our leaders and our hope we have , but we never talk about it .
Not a lot of money .
One of my favorite literary <unk> is that it comes from one word from <unk> <unk> , and she 's from the southern south of the United States .
What 's the story of a story called " Daniel <unk> , " which is a white woman who has a daughter woman whose daughter and a black girl and she looked at her girl , she saw her own girl who was so proud of what she was doing ?
" Why do n't you live in life ? "
But what is the real problem that if we do n't do harm , what does it cost ?
What does it cost ?
And I had a lot of great leaders of my life , and they 've got a lifetime of life .
When I was working at the Rockefeller Foundation , there was a commitment to a woman named <unk> <unk> .
She is the chief of the <unk> tribe , which is a foreign community of North America .
And the project is always a lot of parties , and she 's going to let us think about how to decide in the Eastern community in America .
She said that old people will imagine their children 's face -- seven generation of eyes , looking at their offspring , watch their kids , look at the age of the old age , seeing them as a child .
<unk> , all of us , are connected , not just with other people , and other creatures on Earth are connected together .
<unk> , in 1999 , when she went to the convention of Columbia and the Palestinian minister of the community , she had a lot of work with her family , and her two colleagues had been kidnapped and was tortured and mutilated .
And after that , every time of <unk> 2.0 of our organization , we 're all going to get a chair .
A decade later , when I talked to the people who talk to people , whether it 's in <unk> or in the White House offices , we all talk about them all the time , and we 're all talking about hope that they 're going to be saying , " Please love the wisdom of the <unk> wisdom and her spirit , <unk> the career and his life .
When we think about the legacy of people leaving people , I can think of the most powerful forces of <unk> , although she 's very short .
And I was also moved by women and women , and they were very beautiful women who were in Cambodia .
I had seen them in the early ' 90s .
In the 1970s , the Pentagon in the <unk> regime of Pol Pot , <unk> people are mostly about the elite , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
There was only about 30 dancing <unk> who survived .
And I was fortunate to meet one of the last <unk> of what she was going to say today , and she said that they were lying in refugee camps .
They 're going to remember the details of dance , and they want to remember others .
And one of the women was standing in front of her face on lawn hand , and she was on the side of my hand to talk to me about 30 years .
And she said , " But she does n't have the hand , but she does n't have to touch tears .
And so these are the ones who decided they 're going to teach next -- not just the next generation of women , because they 're all old , because they 've been old .
And when I was sitting in the dance room , I looked at them , and they were really beautiful , like they had <unk> around the wing and <unk> the dark color .
And I think , over the course of the experience , that 's the way they pray .
Because they depend on the most powerful things we 've ever seen in our history and to bring it to better futures .
These women are very , very clear that sometimes the most important thing that we do when we spend time is that we ca n't measure the value of the values .
And secondly , I 've seen the opposite of power and leadership .
And recognize the power of power , especially absolute powers of opportunity .
In 1986 , I went to Rwanda , and there was a job in a group of local women who started the first <unk> bank .
One woman is <unk> in the left , and she 's one of the first <unk> women in Rwanda , who is a woman who 's a <unk> woman whose <unk> , which is called a tribal <unk> .
And the institutions that we were building was based on social justice and <unk> and women , and the principles of women .
But <unk> is more concerned about power , not principles .
And even though she was involved in a free party , she had to focus on the three months of <unk> and <unk> , and she came up with two months before the genocide in ethnic attacks , where she entered the extreme <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . She was Carlos <unk> who had been dumped by the people who were n't like women .
She was <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And I went to the prison , and she sat on her face to sit down to her knees and I had to say , " We have a lot of <unk> -- and we have some <unk> , but we 've got a few of them , like grief , that we 're going to think about other people , so we can think of others as well as <unk> .
And it does n't have to be more glamorous than young men .
I 've heard people say that the most dangerous animal in the world is young , <unk> men .
And today , our party is telling women , of course , deeply important to girls , and we need to give girls a little bit more about a fair environment , a lot of men and women who have to know , so many of them have been exposed to the voice of the woman , the men who are being silenced , that the women are <unk> , because there are no forces that do n't have anything to do with the voice , because there 's no force in the society .
Once they sit down on the street , they can think of a job without jobs , without education , and if you 're in this position , you 'll understand why a gun and a punishment can be a spontaneous identity .
Sometimes , some of the investments that make people significant and robust , we have this potential potential .
In Acumen Fund , we have a partner , called <unk> <unk> , and we all think he has a moral imagination to help other people .
And he was frequently connected to the world 's largest <unk> <unk> .
But they 're great people .
They 've launched a <unk> <unk> , which is about 100 percent of the people who are interested in TED , and they read books .
And they had the commercial plan .
They wanted to be a tutor .
I came from Chris , and I learned a lot about how many things had learned in a lot of young people .
Maybe it 's the most powerful thing .
And he said , " In the past , we thought we did n't think we could do something . "
We all think about economic income is to sustain people , but we 're wrong .
Because what we 're passionate about is that we can see each other .
And these young guys are doing the <unk> , and they 're just sitting every day , just like HIV / AIDS .
So they wanted to be able to figure out the side of <unk> and <unk> , and to discover the <unk> of local communities , creativity , people , artists , entrepreneurs , entrepreneurs .
And you start doing this .
I 'm here to show them respect .
And the main thing about my work is how to make charity more effective and how they make capitalism better .
Our Acumen Fund is looking for charity , and then we 're going to use it as a patient who can invest in the patient , so we usually tend to give people a sense of urgency , to the entrepreneurs of the poor , as an entrepreneur who wants to solve their problems and make decisions .
Our investment cycle is about 10 to 15 years to the cycle of change , and we 're going to be able to focus on other innovations in the world that we can be concerned about .
And I know that pattern is working .
We 've been investing in 50 million dollars to invest in more than 50 dollars , and these companies are created by trillions of <unk> , which are the ones who are forgotten .
This year , they provided the service service for <unk> medical services , housing , <unk> , solar power , the solar system , and people were happy to deal with these things that they had their problems .
For people who want to pay attention to the short - term community , the patient 's investment is hard to imagine , because the first purpose of these investments is not for free .
And we saw a lot of entrepreneurs who were going on and on the planet .
And we 'd like to end up with a part of the end of what 's going to be done , and that 's the core of <unk> social effects , which is to re - examine what 's important to us .
And my dream is that we do n't just have the investment of our investment , and based on that pen , we invest in a lot of money , but also the people who are able to get the resources to make the world better .
It 's only when we 're going to celebrate those people who are telling them that the world is changing .
In the last five months , I 've gone through two opposite attitudes to the world , and it 's based on the other side of my face , building the violence of violence .
At the time I was in Pakistan , I had 18 <unk> of <unk> attacks in the day .
And the reason for that is that the people who are singing are <unk> from another Islamic age , and it 's not entirely Muslims , they 're not Muslims .
This injury is not only about one percent of the population , and it 's got more <unk> and <unk> , anger , fear , outrage .
But one of the other ones in the 24 hours of <unk> is a investment for Acumen <unk> -- and he 's a very glamorous man , called <unk> <unk> , who shares a <unk> life .
He was born in <unk> , and he was working in the <unk> of the city , working on the Prime Minister , months later , and he went to Pakistan .
Two years of time , he almost did n't make any money , just with a little amount of license , and he was giving a terrific house called <unk> <unk> .
And the idea was that there was a way to build a living community on this barren land , and it was helping by the help of patient capital , but he kept doing it .
He was standing in a moral platform , no <unk> .
So for two years , it took a couple of years .
But what I 've seen from him is how the moral criteria is <unk> .
In this region , there 's about 2,000 people who live in his head at the age of his building .
There was also schools and clinics and things .
But there 's only one <unk> .
And I asked <unk> , " How do you make a difference ? It 's a community of <unk> .
Who is it ? "
He said , " OMG . "
That process is very difficult , but the community 's leaders go together and they realize they have something else .
And so from the three levels of all three <unk> of the world , it 's three times the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , all of the people who are in the <unk> are not born , and <unk> or <unk> can be <unk> .
We 're going to need the moral leaders and the courage to the world .
We 're facing a very serious problem , like <unk> Global warming , which is more powerful , and it 's more powerful .
But every day , we have a choice .
We can choose a very easy path , or more <unk> , that 's usually based on some of the challenges that have been done by the past -- or a fear of other people 's fears , or <unk> .
We can also choose a more difficult path to change the path of compassion , which is based on love and love .
And I 've been working with <unk> Robert <unk> , and he 's going to get to change the change in <unk> .
And what he told me was a very impressive story , a six - year - old girl , called <unk> <unk> , and she 's the first part in the south <unk> of the <unk> , where the Chinese state goes into the <unk> .
And he said , the six - year - old girl is going to get out of the beautiful clothing of clothing , and they 're able to scream in the middle of a lot of white men and say she 's a <unk> and <unk> resistance to her <unk> .
Robert <unk> looks at her every day she talks about her talk .
And he said , " Hey , what do you say ? "
And she said , " I do n't speak . "
And he finally , he said , " <unk> , I do see you talk .
What are you talking about ? "
And she said , " <unk> <unk> , I do n't have a conversation . "
" What are you in the prayer ? "
" I pray God can forgive them because they do n't know what they 're doing . " And she 's six years old , and she has a lot of life .
But she also became part of the history , and let 's think about it every single person should have a liberal education .
And the final story of the last story is a young man named <unk> <unk> , and he 's also a member of a Acumen Fund .
We took that one company out of 200 miles , and the home company is in Kenya .
And at the end of the night , he said to me , " <unk> , I was so honored because I felt like a farmer in Africa to learn how to do it .
In particular , when I speak to women in Africa , I sometimes feel like they 're going to learn a little bit about listening .
He said , " Well , I want to teach leadership .
It 's a fabulous amount of <unk> , which is very beautiful when it comes to the world , and it 's really beautiful , it 's going to depend on the world .
But what it does is it <unk> you to feel a sense of a certain amount of gratitude and a reliable force to the land .
We need leaders .
We need to be a leader of leaders , and we need that kind of courage to believe that we can transform our lives , to <unk> every person on the planet , for every woman , women and children .
And we also need to have a humility , to recognize the power of our own forces .
Robert <unk> once said , " It 's only a few people who can contribute history , but we can change every single step .
And when that changed , our history was like this . "
Our lives are so short that we can live in this planet , and we 've got a lot of <unk> , which we have to do with each other .
Everyone wants you to have a <unk> life .
And this is n't easy , but it 's a lot of life that 's going to get us out of it .
Thank you .

<unk> can be one of the most famous faces in the world , but if you know about this writer , <unk> <unk> looks like the truth of <unk> , the Japanese <unk> thinks that he 's going to take a real face in his face .

Yves <unk> 's real face of face
Good morning .
Let 's take a look at the great exploration of <unk> <unk> .
And we 're familiar with his <unk> , but his paintings , his invention .
But we do n't know what to do .
There are hundreds of thousands of people who are <unk> for him , but people are still <unk> .
Even this famous <unk> could n't get a lot of art .
What do you think ?
Is this the face of <unk> <unk> ?
Let 's find answers .
<unk> is a person who is going to draw all sorts of things .
And he painted the character of his character , body structures , plants , buildings , buildings , things .
But do n't you ever have a face ?
I think this is incredible .
And his contemporary artist paintings paintings , as you 've seen here , are <unk> or three - tenths of the side .
So , like <unk> <unk> , there will be a few days later .
Let 's try and find them out .
And I think that if we look at all of his work , we can find the face , and we can find his face .
So I looked at all of his paintings , 700 men , looking for men .
This is what I found about 120 .
How could this be possible ?
And as we see here , <unk> have a <unk> , or three - to - a - 3 .
So we have all these <unk> .
<unk> needs to be <unk> .
So we can also use these <unk> or <unk> signs .
At the same time , people in <unk> , the greatest <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- even though it 's <unk> .
And so we came up with <unk> and those comics .
Now look at the front -- three <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Here are the three .
Indeed , the old <unk> is one of the most famous <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
And the last one is the only photo of <unk> <unk> 's " musician <unk> . "
And before we start working on these face , I should explain something about what I 'm going to show you about .
I wrote over 12,000 characters , and for all sorts of articles , 300 years , 30 years of <unk> , only 30 decades .
But the painting was made of <unk> . Very few poets came like this .
So I was <unk> with paintings and analysis .
Okay , let 's look at this <unk> portrait .
You 've got to sit down , because if we 're going to zoom in these <unk> , we 'll find that they have all the same buses and toes , <unk> flakes , the nose of the mouth and the <unk> .
When I first noticed that it was n't my eyes .
And that 's what these signs might be like .
We 're just looking for <unk> <unk> , but the signs is so similar .
And the question is , should they draw through the correct order of time ?
The signs of young people should be the first evidence of discovery .
And if you look at the year of these markers , you see the truth .
And that 's what they did for the appropriate time .
And how big is the age of these markers at <unk> ?
Yeah , completely <unk> . He 's a <unk> - old , <unk> and <unk> age .
In other words , we now have this <unk> portrait of the same person , the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> to make these markers .
But how do we know people who are <unk> <unk> rather than others ?
We need a standard standard of standards .
This is the only picture of <unk> <unk> .
This is David <unk> , who is <unk> by 15 years old .
And if we compare this to the face of the <unk> face and the musician , we 'll see the same trait before .
This is the title of the <unk> , and <unk> the relationship between the three Face <unk> .
Ladies and gentlemen , this story is published .
It 's a <unk> for the TED audience , right ?
And most of the people in the end of the world have a <unk> .
And he was -- <unk> <unk> .

<unk> Michael <unk> is one of the mythic attributes of brain , and the brain is <unk> itself . He 's working on his ability to use his own capabilities to improve our skills and restore our capabilities .

Michael <unk> on the brain
And each of us is in this machine , let me reminded you a little bit about <unk> , which is to ask you what the best thing is .
And the answer is this machine .
It 's a lot of <unk> to change .
It allows us to do something that we ca n't do today today yesterday .
And of course , it 's a stupid man .
And before you see the baby -- it 's my age .
<unk> ?
Anyway , when she was born , even her brain had been developed a few months in the womb , but for any natural child , her ability was very limited .
If we test her perception , we 'll find these capabilities very primitive .
And it 's not exactly true that she has really thought about the ability to think .
In fact , almost none of the evidence is that a young baby has any cognitive skills .
Babies do n't respond to the baby .
There 's no exaggeration to suggest that the brain is in control .
And they can only control them in a very primitive , very limited way .
And a few months later , this baby can be able to control a little bit of action in the face , such as walking into something like walking .
And a few months later , over the course of a long period of stability , it goes from the back of the body , to sit down and down to the <unk> , and to walk , walking , walk in this wondrous moment .
And yet , when we studied brain , we found very impressive evolution .
By the age of this age , the brain can actually store things .
It 's going to be stored , and it 's got hundreds of things that have hundreds and thousands of objects , behaviors and things in this world .
And these relationships can actually be created by thousands of other ways .
And in this age , the brain has a very delicate sense of skills .
And the cognitive skills are evolving .
The brain is essentially a machine .
In this age , there 's no one in the age of the brain , in the brain .
In fact , in this age , the brain uses a huge amount of control .
In this age , we can find that it 's a very strong evolution of <unk> .
Now , the ability to control movement is to evolve to this complex way of doing complexity in complex ways , like <unk> , and that complexity of complex motion needs .
This boy is able to use the head of the head .
He comes from the Sao Lama in Brazil , and the big boys are about 40 percent of the time .
But if you go to the Monterey community , find a boy who is dyslexic .
If you find one , maybe you 're from Sao Paulo .
And this suggests that our personal skill and abilities are based on the environment .
This environment is <unk> to our modern culture , and our brain provides challenges .
Because each of us is in the human mind , based on the skill of a large part of our experience and our ability to influence .
In fact , the most amazing thing about humans is that we 're all unique .
Each of us has a very different set of skills and skills , and those skills are <unk> by the brain , which is the <unk> of <unk> machines .
And for a young brain , of course , we 've got a number of big skills and skills that we can be able to do with the memory , and that allows us to be acting , to move , thinking about the way that we 're acting .
We look at the scientists of the MIT Lab , and we 've studied that the brain is working on animals , like mice , monkeys , the <unk> , this amazing creature on the planet , we study these brains that learn how to learn and skills .
And we 're trying to figure out how change the brain is at the same time .
We do research in all these different species of species , which means , from <unk> , it 's always going to <unk> and <unk> .
So for example , we might study how a mouse is able to get a <unk> or an capacity to use it , and that skill can be done with its claws , which is that we 're probably going to study a child who is working on the same skills and the skills that they get to read .
Or we 're going to study a much more sophisticated capacity to work with the ability to read the power of music , or how it works to be able to use the capabilities of music and how to play the instrument .
And through these research , we 're sure that two important times of the brain form .
The first important period is usually the dictionary .
And in this period , the brain formed its first form , and it 's essentially the same .
The brain is going to have a huge change in the brain , but it does n't have to evolve in a different way .
For example , in the sound of sound , it has to be <unk> around .
And the brain is actually expanding the sound of the environment .
So , for example , I can cook a animal in a non - <unk> environment , and these sounds are I built . I use it through the environment .
And what I found was that the brain of this animal came to the beginning of the sound , and in its ability to steer the outside of it , the brains were able to create a kind of organized ideal form .
This voice does n't have to be valuable for this animal . I can make the animal grow in a hypothetical voice , like <unk> the sound of a child .
And I can see that the brain is actually going to develop a unified processor for this complex sequence .
It 's actually embedded in large quantities of <unk> <unk> , <unk> them .
Or I can use this animal 's place in a completely non - <unk> environment .
I can bring animals into a <unk> environment , and this is equivalent to the environment of a baby in the middle of the high - intensity voice .
And when you do that , I actually make the brain of the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
And it turns out that I <unk> the ability to <unk> my brain .
This is happening in real life , in their early stages .
And these can explain , for example , in every normal <unk> of babies , language 's wonderful evolution .
These are the ones that have a very big amount of kids who are capable of getting a problem in the way that they 're older than their older capabilities .
In the early days of the brain , brain change and learning does n't work .
I do n't have to focus on what I hear .
<unk> information is not necessarily meaningful .
I do n't need to be there .
And the brain needs to run a different way of making different activities , to make a sense of choice , in this particular kind of way .
The next story of life is that most of the time is in life , the brain is actually learning the same skill and the capacity to make it more useful .
And in this phase , it 's been dead from the first year of life , and actually the brain is in the process .
And that means that the importance of the brain is an important importance to monitor signals .
It focused on an skill , a skill that takes a certain amount of attention .
And this is exactly whether the behavior is done , or whether it 's in this behavior , or in this behavior ?
This function is really very powerful .
And this is the <unk> of the brain , the ability to form , to change the ability to vary .
That 's what we 're really different about .
We can detect the brain of a particular kind of technique , and we can see or record or documenting this .
That 's a very simple experiment .
This is actually an experiment that was done five years ago in the <unk> , in <unk> .
This is a very simple experiment , and it 's training a monkey that teaches a tool to learn a little bit about learning a child .
This monkey actually came up with 700 times after that .
At first , this monkeys is completely incapable of handling this mission .
It 's been successful about a fifth one .
These were trying to improve .
Every time you try to try and try something important .
But this monkey developed a strategy .
After about 700 attempts trying to <unk> it , it could be <unk> .
And he was able to get a lot of food for this instrument .
And in this case , this task is <unk> by a perfect <unk> . Very perfect control , divide and effort .
We can study these monkeys inside the brain .
We can look at it .
We can record these changes , and as long as time change , it changes the changes underlying behavior .
And we can see that this <unk> , this is the skin of the monkeys .
This is a brain accelerator chart , and on the surface of the brain , we use a very elaborate experiment , which is really very , very detailed in each area .
What we see here is the brain of how brain <unk> <unk> .
We actually <unk> through this experiment .
And in this pink region , we can see that there are two <unk> of the skin .
These are the ones that are used to control the tools for control .
If we look at the <unk> of the monkeys cortex , we can find that it 's only a monkey that has changed the amount of wood that comes from what 's used in the skin .
That means , in this most devastating , <unk> region of the body , there 's still a single , simple thing about <unk> <unk> .
The monkeys and the women are all .
But now it 's going to depend on a much larger level of <unk> .
This is a monkey that gets further from those surfaces .
And this is the change of the skill or the ability to <unk> , and you can not see it or not .
In fact , in study monkeys , we studied a few different areas of the cortex .
Each of these areas is about the ability to create special changes or power .
So for example , we 're looking at the region of the monkeys , and we 're looking at the region where the brain is in control .
We studied the activity of alternative regions in the area of the brain , and the effects of <unk> , the behavior of the monkeys , the monkeys , and the <unk> of those monkeys .
They are all <unk> . They 're all at the moment .
When you learn a little bit about this simple technique , there 's 15 or 20 cortex areas affecting specific changes .
That means a huge change in your brain .
It 's called the <unk> of millions of neurons in your brain to change the way it is .
It stands for a billion or billions of gallons of control .
This is what happens to the physical method .
And the number is huge .
Just to think about the changes in the kids , the brain is happening .
Or it 's in the process of <unk> .
These changes are huge .
determines what 's important about the brain , it 's the selective <unk> <unk> of the brain .
Because most of the time in the brain , it 's in <unk> control .
That 's what you notice .
It 's a reward for you .
It 's the brain that thinks that you have <unk> or matters .
This is all depends on the neocortex and the <unk> .
And those impacts have one of you .
That 's why you 're a special set of people who have a lot of skill and skill , a brain that 's going to happen in the physical detail with 100 years ago , and the brain of a thousand years of human brain is much bigger .
So , one of the characteristics of changing the process is that information has always been connected to other rocks and information .
And this is because the brain built all sorts of things , and it 's also the same amount of relationship between <unk> .
All the information in the brain is <unk> all over time .
So , the most powerful environment in your brain is that you have your own .
There 's billions of things in your personal history , and they 're all over time with you , as a coach , or a CFO or or <unk> .
As a <unk> , you 've got a little bit of information from your body , and it turns out that it 's something that makes you feel that the body is specific .
You 're building it by the billions of times .
You 're wired , and you 're building the brain .
This is based on the brain .
And this big thing is made of individual forms , because we have a very different history of history , and it 's really different .
We use this research , not only to try to understand how an individual is developed , how to develop their skills , and how it 's going to start understanding the beginning of understanding <unk> , change or mutate .
And I 'm going to talk about how to use these strategies to actually design the brain , to <unk> your brain for a new way of making kids , and to increase the capacity for the kids , to read it .
And I 'm going to talk about some experiments , and they 're actually using <unk> , first , to understand how it 's going to make a difference .
And then , through a method of purpose , we 're going to use it to distinguish a certain amount of brain damage to the old ones .
The first example that I 'm going to talk about is <unk> <unk> .
We have a lot of data to show you , in most of the early stages of <unk> , they 're going to be able to read a problem in learning , and that 's where they are created by a <unk> form .
That 's why it 's developed by <unk> , because in the early age of the baby , the brain is <unk> .
That 's that easy .
It 's a problem signal . Okay ?
And the reason for that is much more .
There 's a lot of variation in the brain that might cause the noise that the brain works .
But the noise of noise is also based on the environment , from the ear .
The older friends of your son know when we 're small , we think a child is born .
And we know that their cognitive development will be <unk> . We know they learn a lot about the normal language that we learn to read .
Most of them are in <unk> and universities .
But now this idea disappears .
And those sorts of ideas about genetics , genes disappear .
We did n't hear that . How did this happen ?
Well , in 35 years ago , a <unk> surgeon found out , if you could have enough problems , it would be the first time when the brain was born , so it could n't happen in the beginning , and then it was n't going to happen .
So what do we do with surgery ?
And basically , we 're going to get dust to dust , and they are full of liquid .
Every single <unk> sound that children heard is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
In this case , kids are not English .
Not Japanese .
This is by <unk> English , <unk> Japanese .
That 's the junk .
And the brain is all there .
It 's based on <unk> seals .
And then the kids could n't get rid of it .
These rubbish are not only happening in the ear .
It will happen in the brain .
The brain is <unk> . It 's normal .
But there are some <unk> that can make it more <unk> .
And in this brain , this child is <unk> .
It 's not English , but by <unk> English .
And this brain machine is very glamorous , and it 's going to develop very unnatural , different strategies for the <unk> of sound .
We can examine the brain brain and release the <unk> .
Their size is much higher than the average kids , about average average than normal kids .
<unk> is about three times the normal kids .
These are the ones that are going to be <unk> with cognitive effects .
And of course , they 're going to have a problem because of the language of language , and they will accept that language is <unk> .
So they would have read skills .
Because read the sound of the word " <unk> " or the <unk> form of this <unk> form .
If you do n't have your brain , then it does n't make any sense .
You 're going to have a normal problem with <unk> .
We 've been reading the ability to read the capacity to speak at the language of language , and again , we 've taken this normal problem .
And the point is that we can train this problem to get rid of the problem .
You can imagine that you can actually change the ability to <unk> your brain .
<unk> to change . That 's 30 hours per gallon .
Today , we 've been doing success about 7,000 kids .
In fact , there are about 10,000 children who are trained now .
In fact , when you look at it , it 's really important .
Let 's see the <unk> .
And what we 're most interested in is the kids on the left .
That 's probably from 3,000 kids .
You can see most of the kids on the left are moving towards the middle or the right .
This is an <unk> measure of their language .
It 's kind of like the judge of language .
If you 're trained to train every American child , then it 's the whole distribution of distribution , and the distribution is <unk> .
It will be very important .
Think about the kids of language skills .
Imagine the <unk> kids in the class .
We have the possibility to move most of the children in the middle to the middle .
It 's also very precise , but it also improves memory and cognition , language and <unk> .
And also to train a important language for students -- to read it .
In a large amount of ways , you can talk about the brain .
In Stanford , MIT , San Francisco <unk> , UCLA and his church , we can see the changes in the brain .
When kids are doing different languages , or different kinds of behavior , in a lot of different children , their neurons are trained , but it 's going to reach the complexity .
Well , we can also solve the problems for aging .
And in this , in the brain , it 's a brain brain that goes into the age .
<unk> noise in the brain .
The mechanism of learning and control is in apathy .
In fact , we can see the brain in this kind of individual brain change , for example , in the case of the <unk> of language .
It 's a very chaotic brain , as soon as the brain gets back at the end .
<unk> memory , cognitive senses , control body and flexibility .
And the result is that we can train these individual brains , and that 's a little bit of training , which is about 30 hours .
They 're 80 to 90 years old .
And we found that the ability to change the amount of change , remember , to remember the capacity to focus , control the capabilities , language and vision , the ability to space .
The <unk> of these <unk> is about two times higher than average .
That means that if you 're in the front of the circle , I 'm looking at your personal psychology , normal people who have moved towards the middle or the distribution .
And that means that most of the people who are in the age of aging , or early threats , there 's now a protected threat .
And my point is to save the old ones in larger numbers , because I think it 's possible that most of you are going to be able to do it .
My main interest is how to use this scientific problem .
And I 'm especially interested in autism and <unk> , these diseases are <unk> for kids .
The older problems are the older ones , as well as positive , as <unk> , like schizophrenia .
And what this science has to do with you is how to keep yourself reliable .
And of course , there 's order to be <unk> , and the key to learn is that it 's going to work .
In your future , the brain is <unk> .
It 's ready to prepare . It will be part of everyday life , in the future of the world , as <unk> as a normal life in every sane place .
We think that the ultimate way of making and science is important is to think about how to cultivate themselves .
Because now you know , science tells us that you are able to control your own , you 're on your control , your happiness , the ability to live , <unk> , potential and potential , productivity , productivity .
Certainly many people ignore this proposition .
They really understand <unk> <unk> .
This is another problem , <unk> .
Okay . Thank you .
<unk>
When he understood his wife had to do it in food and <unk> , <unk> <unk> to her question about health care . He looked at the question , and it made his question a powerful business .
Talks
<unk>
<unk> : How do I start a health revolution !
So I 'm going to do something for my wife .
And it makes me stand here , and I 'm going to get older and wealth .
This story came from when I was married .
What do you do when you get married ? I think it 's good for wife , right ?
<unk> , I found that my wife looks like this .
And I said , " What is that ? "
My wife answered , " <unk> your thing . "
But , I 'm a husband , and I do n't think she saw her , she looked at her .
I do n't even want to use it .
And I quickly realized that she did n't care about what she was doing .
And I asked her , how do you use something like this ?
And she said , " Well , I know there are <unk> , but I do n't have a lot of money with my sister , if we do that .
What do I have to do with her <unk> ?
People are called <unk> .
So I 'm going to buy my wife 's wife and buy a box for me to vote for her .
I bought <unk> <unk> in a shop .
And the man who came up with a newspaper in <unk> , <unk> it , sent me to <unk> .
And I thought , " What 's wrong with it ? I 'm not going to buy <unk> .
And then I went through that box , and I wanted to see what there was .
That was when I was 19 years old .
And I want to know , how many of you have touched ?
This does n't care about our men ? Right ?
I 've got <unk> , white , not just the Grand Canyon , which is a little amount of money .
Why do n't I do a little <unk> for my wife ?
That 's the end of the story , but where did I get to track ?
It looks like a laboratory .
I need a volunteer , but I 'm in India .
Even in Bangalore , no matter .
So the only victims could only be my wife .
And I did my work with <unk> , and she said , yes , her name is .
" The eyes , " and what 's wrong is that it 's not a <unk> , not an <unk> , not a chocolate , and it 's not doing something like this .
Please close your eyes . "
I want to make things intimacy .
Because this is the marriage of the parents , not <unk> .
And finally , she told me that she did n't have to engage my research .
And then I came up with something else .
<unk> and wife , they do n't support me .
That 's why I have the perpetual ambition of India .
They 've always got a lot of women out there .
Why do n't I ?
And you know , there 's a lot of women who are not going to die , and there are many women coming up .
I went to the medical girl .
And they did n't get me . Finally , I decided I could use it .
I feel like I 've left the first <unk> <unk> on the moon .
Or <unk> and <unk> , I , <unk> is the world 's first man wearing <unk> .
I 'm wearing the animal , and I <unk> the blood vessels in the bottle , I wrapped my bottle down here and put it in my underwear , when I walk to the <unk> and <unk> that bottle of blood vessel . "
This is a five - year - old who is very encouraging to women , and I 've had five chaos - worth of work in my life .
Oh , Jesus .
The problem is , the factory can do well with <unk> .
And I 'm also doing a good job on the main hemisphere , which is <unk> .
And this blew me , and I stopped trying to do it .
And experimentation is money .
It 's not just the money to give me a series of problems , like a wife from wives , from wife .
Why ? Because the girls in the medical world ?
She believes I did this experiment , and she was just a <unk> .
And finally , I learned that a special solid field came from <unk> , but even if it needed millions , millions of dollars had to deal with these ingredients , and so on .
And then I did this with four years of openness to my own machine , a simple machine that looks like this .
This machine allows us to do anything that you can do with the raw material and the process that people do in the midst of the restaurants , and it 's the world 's world .
This is my invention .
When I did this machine , I was doing the same thing when someone had a patent or an invention , and he wanted to do it .
And I did n't do that , and I 'd like to put it down because any of the people who survived it would n't be happy .
There are many people getting billions of people .
What 's the last thing to do ?
So why is that money going to be on charity ?
And it starts with the beginning .
So I took this machine to all the women in India , because there were two percent of women who could n't afford to use the rest of the world , and it was n't even the leaves , the dirt , it 's not <unk> .
That 's the 21st century , and I decided to make the machine a little bit about India .
Now , there are <unk> <unk> in different countries .
Now , already , I 've been working with these high - tech <unk> of these commercial <unk> -- that makes all of the <unk> students .
So , what do you do from a guy from <unk> ?
So they invited me to all of the Indian membership schools .
So the video is a video .
<unk> : I asked my wife : " How can you use that <unk> ? "
And she said , " If I have a <unk> , we have to have less <unk> . "
Why do n't you make a low - cost <unk> for themselves ?
So I decided that I would sell this machine to the community of groups .
This is my idea .
At the time , you need a million investments to buy equipment . Now , any woman 's women can be able to do it .
This video is their last week .
You want to say , you 're going to do a lot of business with high - scale <unk> , if you 're Harvard .
But I asked a woman who could adapt to the Grand Canyon .
She broke seven years .
It 's about 600 . What do I do ?
I 'm going to make the Indian women in my lifetime in my lifetime .
And also , I 'm going to offer a lot of money in India , and I 'm going to give you a few million jobs , and it 's a machine .
And that 's why I do n't want to do it .
I 'm going to do that .
If you 're just <unk> , girl does n't like you .
If you 're not doing anything , girl will go ahead .
Really , I never had a dog .
That 's <unk> . I 'm going to stop .
I do n't feel like I did .
And so I saw questions from a social society .
I 've got solutions , I 'm happy .
I do n't want a big company .
And I think that the women in the world are using <unk> , and that 's why I show the whole data , like a public open software software .
Now , there are about 110 countries starting to introduce it , right ?
I get people into three dimensions , not educated , educated and educated .
There 's a lot of people who are doing this , and you 've got to do something about it .
Thank you very much . Goodbye !
<unk>
<unk> <unk> tells the <unk> of his <unk> Arctic , and he was only <unk> , but he had just <unk> the price of the ice that was going to be the preparation for <unk> ice -- and there was a burning shot of swimming .
adventure , climate change , science , presentation
<unk>
<unk> <unk> , <unk> - <unk> .
I 'm going to talk to you today about the <unk> of the polar Arctic , the world 's most <unk> story .
My best come from my dad .
My dad was a storyteller .
And he 's going to tell you a little bit about it .
And I was always telling me a story about the first bomb trial in England in Britain .
He 's in his head looking at it .
And he said , " Well , he was <unk> , and she had to put his hand up to protect his eyes .
And he also said that he even saw his finger <unk> , because it was really <unk> .
I had to leave my dad with my father 's dad very , very big .
Every time I was a kid was spent in the National Hall Park .
And he did this for the world to protect this world , and let me see how fragile it is .
And he gives me the stories of the great explorers .
He loved history . He 's going to tell me how to <unk> the South , <unk> <unk> , and how <unk> <unk> came to <unk> .
So I was six years old , and I had my dreams to explore .
I want to go to a pretty high .
It was like a myth that attracted me .
But sometimes you have to wait for the first time .
I was at seven years old in the first time .
And it 's really beautiful , let me just go to the next seven years , and look at it every year .
I 'm love .
But I 've seen the change that 's going to happen in this short period of time .
I saw polar bears in a thin <unk> , looking for food .
I was faced with extreme ice ice cream .
I 've also seen ice ice cream in a year a year .
I want the world to know what 's going on in there .
In the two years of the Arctic , 20 percent of <unk> ice ice cap fell down .
And I <unk> the world 's leaders , and let them try to figure out what 's going on .
So I decided to make a paintbrush , and in the world , in a world where it should , unfortunately , it 's a pretty rapid leap .
My message is really clear : climate change is true .
And we need to act immediately .
Of course , swimming crossed across the Arctic is not a normal thing .
And I want you to look at the water of the deep swimming pool , 27 degrees centigrade .
In the morning , the <unk> air is 18 degrees centigrade .
The weight of the ice goes down to the sea , and it 's about five degrees centigrade .
<unk> is in <unk> .
And in the Arctic , there 's only a little amount of <unk> in the Arctic .
That was really cold .
Sorry , I can only say that .
So I have to create a powerful team to help me finish this challenge .
I built a team from 10 countries .
Somebody thinks that swimming is completely <unk> , and you 're just going to jump into the ocean .
It 's actually not true .
And then I started doing big training assignments . At <unk> .
But the key to the training is to engage the challenges that are going to happen .
I had to imagine that I was swimming .
I have to think about that .
I 'm going to <unk> my mouth on my mouth .
I 'm going to see my cousins , " Ha ha ! <unk> sweat ! Come away . Come on . Quick ! Three !
So I actually had hundreds of thousands of times in my head .
And after a year , I think I 'm ready to get ready .
I 'm confident that I can achieve this swimming .
So I did my work with the Inuit , and I went to the Arctic .
The next day , we decided to try and try water , very short , five minutes .
I 've never been at the risk of negative pressure , because it 's impossible to train in conditions like that .
We stop the boat .
And all of you get up to the Grand Canyon , and I 'm going to jump on the ocean .
That feeling that I 've never seen before .
I could n't breathe , I had no breath .
But soon a few seconds later , it 's just a couple of seconds on my hands .
<unk> , you 're in hot water , but feel like a <unk> .
I had to do that for five five years .
I just remember very quickly .
I climb up .
And I remember that when I got rid of my hand , I looked at my hands , and I went down , because my fingers were very good , like <unk> .
They were very , very nice , and my hands had been <unk> .
And what happened was that the main part of the body is the <unk> of water , which is <unk> .
So it 's actually a cells that I have on my fingers .
And they were <unk> . I was an expert .
They sent me back to my shirt and let me give you a little peek .
And I was standing in front of the <unk> , trying to figure out what was going on .
I thought , two days I was going to jump through the Arctic .
I want to try to do it for 20 minutes , with a kilometer in the Arctic .
And this is a dream that I 'm going to do when I was a kid and my dad , and it 's a dream .
How do I do that ?
And I remember the <unk> , and I found that my hand was completely missing .
And as a swimming point , your hand has to have a sense of feeling , because you 're going to be able to grab water and push your body .
And the next morning , <unk> was <unk> at the height of the depression .
If you do n't know who he is , he 's a great U.K. remix .
And a few years ago , he tried to deliver the <unk> to the South .
He went down to the sea .
It 's just in the water for three minutes , just on water , and he finally climbed out the water .
But his hands had been rejected by severe <unk> .
And he went to a local hospital , and the doctors said , " <unk> , we ca n't keep your fingers .
We just <unk> them . "
And I heard that it 's going to take his arm from his tool to his <unk> .
And what happened to me when I was in the <unk> , and if you just had a couple of minutes of it , I sat down at five minutes , so what would it happen if I 'm going to get wet ?
And that 's the best way to do it to me .
And the worst thing about this , I do n't think .
And our boat continues to the Arctic .
My friend David saw my mind , and I said , " Louis , <unk> , From 18 to 18 years old .
I understand that you , so I know , Louis , you 're not going to go to your mind , and you have to go swimming .
I do n't have faith for you , Louis <unk> , and I look at you .
They understand why you do this .
It was really important .
Because we 're in the experience of the history of history , and you 're here to use this symbolic swimming , let 's have leaders in the world .
<unk> , you 're not going to do it , and we do n't want to raise your eyes . "
And his <unk> <unk> my courage , because he understood me .
So we moved on to the Arctic .
We stopped the boat , as scientists , for scientists .
It 's all about the surface of <unk> .
I went into my <unk> , and I sat down on my shirt .
And then the doctors gave me a chest , and she measured my core temperature and <unk> .
And we came up with the <unk> .
And I remember looking at the <unk> , and there 's a huge amount of big ice ice , which is completely black .
I never saw black whales .
And it weighs below half meters .
I said , " Lewis , do n't get tired . Do n't stop .
It 's going to be <unk> . "
I 'm going to show you a clip of the ice .
Video : Our boat is just leaving the <unk> , and it 's a little bit of a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a lot of people who do n't have a lot of money on it .
We saw the first <unk> of the polar bear .
It 's really amazing .
And the bears and her <unk> are good .
But think about 30 or 40 years later .
It 's a very scary thing to do .
And we ended up in <unk> , and this time , in the moment , <unk> my dreams , training , planning and preparing .
Oh , there are about two hours to swimming swimming .
I 'm a little scared and scared .
<unk> : Are you ready ?
There are about 10 seconds .
Put your swimming down , put swimming up !
E : <unk> your shoes up .
Good job , chap ! You 've got your success ! <unk> you 've succeeded .
Your success ! You succeeded .
<unk> <unk> : How do we do that ?

<unk> <unk> : Thank you very much . Thanks very much .
Thank you very much .
Audience : Again .
<unk> <unk> : I 'm going to end with the following hand as the end of my hand , and my <unk> is <unk> the senses .
But what do you do ? Do n't worry .
Now there 's only a couple of people who do n't know what 's happening .
And people say , " <unk> , what can we do about climate change ? "
And I said , I think we need to do three things .
The first is that we need to break this problem into a smaller solution .
In the video , you saw a lot of flag .
And those were the countries that came out of my office .
Similarly , every country has to increase emissions .
England , America , Japan , South Africa , Congo .
All of us have to be <unk> .
And the second thing we need to do is we just have to look at progress in this short period of time .
And I remember it was just a few years ago , when I talked about climate change , and I said , " That 's <unk> . "
I just came back from the <unk> talk , and in South Africa , some of the villages that I 've been talking about .
They 're sitting in front of a table , and they 're in the back of that poor conditions that they know about climate change .
We need to believe ourselves .
And that 's what it is .
We have a big deal . We 're doing good .
But the most important thing is that I think we have to be able to get to the end of our lives , around us , to ask ourselves a fundamental question .
And that 's , " What 's the world that we want to live in , and how do we decide what we 're going to do in a sustainable world ? "
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you .
<unk>
And when the world 's focused on <unk> crisis , we show you Richard <unk> , in 2010 , at the 2010 2010 conference , and he thinks that we have to get rid of the price of oil , where we need to increase it .
alternative power , energy , exploration , green , science , technology
<unk>
Richard <unk> : The end of the oil
And the next few minutes , we talk about energy . And that 's a very different talk .
I 'm going to talk about a story about energy .
My talk is a lot of different aspects of the energy , but from the oil point .
One of the reasons is that it 's great .
Use eight to eight percent of the carbon atoms in the right way , and then you can get the magic fluid , it 's a huge amount of energy , which is easy to extract very practical products and fuel .
That 's really good stuff .
Now , we have a lot of <unk> around the world .
This is my little <unk> map , and it 's going to tag everywhere .
And you can also see the larger ones .
That 's the distribution of oil .
And that <unk> has a very clear thought about oil .
There 's about 100 trillion gallons of oil in the world , and they continue to be developed and <unk> .
Now , one of the words about oil is that we may not be running out of it and say , " Okay , maybe there 's a lot of oil . "
But more and more about this .
By the way , if you think you 're going to get out of a stream of oil , there 's a thousand meters from where we 're in the world .
If you have some interest to me , I can give you some data .
This is just part of the oil , and there are many things .
But what about oil ? What do you do ?
This is a chart of a 150 years of the oil system , which means that oil is in this 150 year , and most of us are our energy systems .
Now , I 'm going to tell you a little secret in the last 25 years , and oil is <unk> down the global energy system .
And in <unk> oil , oil prices were about 50 percent of the time in the world .
Now , oil is 35 .
And this is still down , and I believe that oil will continue to slow down .
In 2007 , the U.S. consumption of the United States is going to get down to the <unk> and start to get down .
So the importance of oil is to slow down .
About about 25 years ago , oil grew up for the first time , like <unk> <unk> in the ' 80s , in 100 years .
And look at this very important <unk> of energy .
What is the oil for the last decades ?
When you start with a large amount of gas and compartments .
What 's going to happen in the future ?
Well , I 'm approaching the last decades of greenhouse ice , even though it 's renewable energy .
Now , I 'm going to tell you about another very important thing about this picture .
I 'm not saying that the global energy use does n't increase it , actually , in increase , and then another thing to talk to me about this topic . We talk about some specific detail . In the last 200 years , we 've been constantly dealing with the energy system in the past two years .
Every day , a few years later , even in the last few decades , the global energy system has become strong to convert <unk> energy systems .
Now we 've developed renewable energy , and in the future , in this century , it 's probably probably 30 percent .
And you think it 's going to end up here ? We 're in the <unk> of the pendulum to be completely autonomous -- but I think , the reality is that it has to do more .
Next part -- let 's look at it even further .
What is the world really sustainable ?
Okay , let 's go back to <unk> . We come to Texas .
This is a <unk> .
I found it in St. <unk> .
It 's about four billion years long .
It 's just <unk> , and it 's not glamorous .
Now this is a piece of chalk .
I 'm from M <unk> , and it 's a short story .
<unk> are different than this . You can recognize it .
We do n't work on chalk , and we 're not going to use it at a threshold .
Well , they 're different . They do n't make any difference .
It 's not different , they 're the same material , calcium carbonate , same calcium carbonate .
The problem with <unk> is molecules .
If you think this is magic , real magic is still true .
We 're going to talk about <unk> in <unk> .
Now , tens of thousands of dollars per year in the last year .
By the way , you might guess , this is calcium carbonate .
Yves Behar and this <unk> are the same material .
But they 're completely different .
This is <unk> <unk> than this chalk , even 3,000 times .
Why ? Because these are kind of <unk> <unk> that can expand , become this beautiful , shining layer of light .
Every single day , tens of thousands of dollars per day to build this very special material .
It 's a very glamorous material .
Anyway , what different ?
How do molecules form together .
So what does this have to do with energy ?
This is a coal mite .
This coal was like this piece of chalk .
Now we 're often talking about fuel efficiency , energy <unk> , or a new material for batteries or <unk> .
That 's why nature does n't look like a <unk> , unless it comes to this material , but it 's just a lot of stuff , and there 's a whole range of species that can survive , the species will produce it .
So let 's think about the future of energy , and imagine , in addition to coal , we can create the <unk> , what would it look like ?
And that 's what I 'm going to talk about .
It never happens .
It 's not because we have a lot of oil .
It 's not because we 're trying to <unk> the <unk> .
It 's been invented since thousands of years ago , the idea is that there 's ideas , creativity , technology , it does n't depend on the rocks .
But the idea is that innovation and technology will not be able to end the oil age .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> thinks he 's going to design the world in the developing world for <unk> , but when his product does n't go into the line , his team learned a important knowledge of knowledge , rather than an actor , not a creator .
design , health care , product design
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : For people , not documenting
I have a <unk> idea that will change the world .
It 's really good , it 's very addictive .
This is my beautiful baby .
Of course , everybody loves a cute baby .
I mean , I 've been a cute little boy .
This is me and my dad , the days where I was born .
So in the other one , this lovely baby is about the equivalent of the car .
It 's the ultimate force .
You 'll say , " My God , I 'm going to spend a lot of money . I 'll buy it anyway . "
That 's why the computers look at the liver last year ?
What 's the problem in design and building companies ?
I do n't want to talk a little bit about this , I 'm talking about the design of this kind of design - old dance age , and you 've got to figure out what the world is .
I want to tell you some research in health care .
The problem is this : four million babies of the world , most of them die before the developing countries , and even in the first year .
And the result is that almost half of the kids , about 180 million <unk> , if you can survive , they live in their lives , or they survive .
So this is a young operating room in Nepal .
All of these things are <unk> in these mature communities -- this is this : This is a Japanese <unk> that gives you the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is what we want .
In fact , it was a hospital in Japan , and all of a sudden they were supplying this device to Nepal .
The problem is , no doctors , without <unk> , like this kind of license .
This is what it looks like when we 're going to help .
She keeps the baby 's warm , not rocket science .
So we started .
We collaborated with an advanced research institutions in Boston .
We 've done a lot of the other sorts of people who are trying to think about design , thinking about design .
Let 's see what people want .
We used to use <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , eventually get this .
This is the baby 's <unk> , and there 's a lot of smart designs that we feel great .
This is what we want to do with <unk> , and we 're going to combine it with something beautiful .
Our idea is that the design of the makers will inspire producers and other people who have affected this idea .
But there 's a bad news : <unk> is the only baby that goes into the baby 's <unk> , and it 's the beginning of the <unk> magazine .
So soon it was spread out .
We want to design it .
It eventually ended up a lot of awards .
But it was a <unk> <unk> .
We want to be able to make the world better , but I think that child does n't even have a flood .
So the design of a creative design is not so -- I want to say , well , if it 's slow , it does n't work .
So I wanted to design it .
I do n't look like anything .
I want to make the world better .
So in our design , we 're dealing with a lot of people in the future , like , for example , poor people who are poor , doctors , <unk> doctor , even <unk> doctors .
When we think about it , we 're going to make the right things right .
So the result is that there 's a whole bunch of <unk> with this product : manufacturing , productivity , <unk> , manage and manage .
Michael <unk> says you have to figure out who will choose , use , to pay for your product .
And I have to ask this question -- <unk> always ask : " Mr. <unk> , what are your businesses ? Who 's your consumer ? "
Who is our consumers ? There is an example .
This is one of the founders of the <unk> hospital .
And we found that he never bought any equipment .
These are the health of health , or <unk> , and Muslims decided to do it .
Same medical device on <unk> .
They 're only going to be there , fishing .
So the result is that , in these developed markets , there are these countries in the middle of the country -- rich , rich diseases : heart disease , disease .
So in <unk> , for example , it means design design .
Well , that 's really important .
Secondly , we use those statements to make the next project .
So we found that the production of production is called <unk> , and in Vietnam , it 's produced by <unk> equipment .
Our other partners is " <unk> <unk> . "
This is an American organization in the United States , which is a hospital for the poor .
So they started asking us , " What do you want ? "
What do you want to solve ? "
And they said , " Well , let 's study <unk> . "
This is another challenge of the world .
<unk> impact on two percent of the world .
And all of a sudden , about 10 percent of all the <unk> , and if you do n't have a hundred years of damage , it <unk> the whole lifespan , or it 's going to cause child mortality , or whatever it is , the child dies , and it will cause a child die of child deaths , which is a little amount of kids die in child survival , right ?
There 's only one way of managing <unk> , which is called trading <unk> .
You can imagine that this is expensive , and it 's a risk .
There 's another new approach to this .
Very advanced , complex , little fears .
What do you have to do with the baby ? How much skin do you have ?
How can this be the problem ?
So I went to MIT , okay , we 'll figure it out .
Here 's an example . This is a <unk> <unk> device on the head for the U.S.
This is what it is using .
On the side of the baby , <unk> a patient .
And in the United States in America , for example , it 's <unk> in Asia .
The effects of <unk> are the strength of light .
These are blue - blue <unk> showing up .
And that 's actually what it is .
So these kids , in the upper hemisphere , did n't get a <unk> .
But who would know that ?
We see other questions like this .
This is an emerging form of mother who can come in and get their baby .
And remember , these mothers might have done a lot of <unk> , so she might be <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> baby .
She saw her baby light , and she saw a lot more fragile under light .
For mother , in the kids , it 's normal to make a difference .
But it 's not very good for the effects of the <unk> .
This is actually absurd .
But what we learned was that we did n't have stupid people who were n't stupid .
Only <unk> products , no keyboards .
We have to think like <unk> .
This is not what we want to draw out of the painting that we already have painting .
This is actually what works , from design .
So what do you do with it ?
Similarly , when we think about our partners , they 're doing very high - tech effects associated with <unk> disease .
This is a warm <unk> <unk> and a <unk> .
These are very cheap , very old ones .
They 've used this technique for <unk> <unk> .
The problem is that every doctor in this world , every hospital in the world is watching television -- the E <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that they all know about a medical device .
They want to <unk> , but they do n't want good effects .
It sounds crazy , so it 's a ridiculous hospital , but there 's actually no reason why they 're not going to make it expensive or <unk> .
So if we want people to trust a device , it needs to be trusted .
So it 's important to think about the outcome .
So we combine this information together .
We 're trying to make it work .
This is what we developed .
This is a <unk> - <unk> medical device that we do n't think we 're not in here .
From a beginning , we 've got those manufacturers .
Our goal is to do a kind of a <unk> product , so our partners can be able to manufacture the production of production .
So our goal is to understand how it works , and they have resources that they can build this product .
This is design design .
When we think about it , you find that there is a single <unk> <unk> .
It 's only the next baby .
And the use of this machine should be very clear .
If you want to <unk> , you 're going to stack them up .
This is what we 're talking about , and it 's really hard to use it .
In other words , you have to do the best way to use it right now to use it .
Another example : those <unk> .
And they felt that her baby looked like a little bit of a blanket in it .
So this is why we 're down there .
So even if a mother came up , the baby would get a <unk> treatment .
Last story , I have a friend of mine who says , " You still do n't check a device in Asia , of course , unless you train a leopard , and then all the little corners of the small corner .
Okay , you feel so funny .
I have a laptop in <unk> , and my screen had these terrible <unk> .
And then I was left , and these are all dead ants that died into my laptop and extinct poor ants !
So for <unk> , what we do is , when the electronics became hot , you have to put <unk> or fall in the air , to keep the temperature for most products .
We decided we could put a " <unk> " button .
But we ended up missing that thing .
So <unk> is completely <unk> .
There are some reasons like a young adolescent , which is much more <unk> than a <unk> .
So what I really want to do is change the world .
I have to make a lot of work .
I have to be very interested in using these guys .
So really , it 's not <unk> .
I have to think about <unk> .
I have to accept this fact : There is no <unk> users .
We have to ask ourselves .
Are we designed to design the world .
Are we designed to design our world ?
Are we at the beginning of the world ? Is n't we ready ?
I was in this business design .
I learned that if you 're really wanting to make a contribution to the world , you have to design it .
And this is the design of the science , and the design of the design .
Thank you .
<unk>
And Marc <unk> was interviewed in a series of interviews in the National <unk> National Research Foundation in <unk> , and he shows a lot of the <unk> of success and sharing his research and share a funny story about <unk> Martin <unk> .
art , history , performance , personal growth
<unk>
Marc <unk> : A art art
National <unk> has dedicated to public American lives , extraordinary American people .
That 's what it is .
We use <unk> to <unk> these people .
So I 'm not really here today .
I want to talk about a project that I 've developed in my lifetime .
I 'm worried about an truth for a truth , which is a lot of people who have n't lived in love , but they 're very glamorous , and we want to talk to the kids .
So what do we do ?
So I came up with this <unk> series of sequences .
That 's basically what I 'd like to do as a documentary maker , and they tagged through their interview .
And I 'm not going to talk about the success of this exhibition , and what you want to do in this situation is how you go to these people , you 're trying to figure out what 's going on in them and they 're <unk> or <unk> .
I have two answers to interview two points .
One , <unk> is the American .
This is determined by National <unk> -- this is a projection of American people .
And this is easy , and then one decision , perhaps , is a bit of a certain age of <unk> , which is the old age , where you 're going to start with a group of people who are older .
60 , 70 , 80 , old , even 90 years old .
And obviously , it 's not very old to me now .
So why do I do this ?
First , we live in a culture of young people .
But I think we need to give a stage for <unk> , and let 's sit in front of the <unk> .
And the second point is -- as I 've got older , I 'm more confident .
Most of the things they 've been talking about , they tell them that they 're a magic thing .
This is one of the major wisdom of <unk> .
Well , the good thing to do is , of course , there 's a bad place , but our common life is that we 've been able to read the <unk> of <unk> .
So , we went back to life , and if we had a understanding of these <unk> , then we could tell the rest of the life of the world .
All of these <unk> have done this fabulous life that we heard today .
And then I started thinking , how can you achieve this effect ?
There are various kinds of interviews that we all know .
It 's a journalist interviewing , and it 's more like asking and <unk> .
You have to deal with <unk> and <unk> .
Another <unk> researcher , <unk> <unk> , often is more important than who 's more than <unk> .
<unk> and other people are in this , and everybody loves it .
It 's important to talk about <unk> , like <unk> <unk> .
That 's it .
But I want to interview these different things .
I want to be able to achieve " <unk> , " which means that I think they 're going to tell you what they want .
Remember , this is all done in front of <unk> .
This is not just a show of history .
300 audiences sit in front of the car , and I 'm a <unk> <unk> .
Well , I found that I was really good at it .
I did n't know .
And the only reason for that is that I was doing a interviews on Sylvia <unk> called <unk> , which was six months before his stroke .
He did n't have a stroke when he was blind .
That pressure is not very severe , but it 's also affecting the conversation and other behaviors .
And I think he can try to get it to meet you , and he thinks that , so we 'll come to the stage and talk about a hour , about his life , to end up with a woman who says , " Where do you accept medicine ? "
And I said , " I 've never been taught before , I have never seen it before . "
And she said , " Okay , I 've got it .
When he started saying a little bit about it , especially in the early stages of the first stage , and then <unk> , you give him a word , which is like a bridge that goes to the end of his sentence . And then he 's starting to say , " Well , he started to say the whole statement . "
I do n't know what happened , but I 'm trying to help him finish that process .
So I thought , okay , I 've already known how to move through , or maybe " <unk> , " and that 's the key to success .
But then I started thinking about something else .
How do you make a good interview ?
This is not relevant for the <unk> of <unk> .
Some of them are very smart , and they do n't think they 're smarter , but those are n't important .
They 're also the key to themselves .
It 's this remarkable interviewing and remarkable life .
I do n't feel like this .
And this energy is not the power of young people .
Some of them are in old 80s .
In fact , the first person I interviewed was George <unk> , and he was <unk> . But <unk> had been alive -- and I thought , well , it 's full of energy .
And then he came here , and he had a very special conversation .
And he was thought to be the most sought , because he did n't say , well , he does n't tell you , even though it 's a word , it 's a word .
But , in fact , he was saying a lot about it , and his energy was still in other ways .
And he was married at the age of <unk> , so you know , he 's a lot of life .
After the interview , I got a telephone , and I had a voice , a woman .
And I do n't know who she is . She says , " You ask George <unk> ? "
And I said , " Yeah , that 's true . "
And she said , " I 'm a little dancer , and I ca n't get him wrong . "
And then she took me to the <unk> , and I showed her George <unk> .
So you see , you need that energy , and it needs life , but you still need to make sure that their story is worth sharing .
The worst interview is the <unk> person .
Do n't interview a <unk> person because they 're just saying a little bit about it , but they sit down there and say , " <unk> , that 's just an accident . "
It seems to have never seen anything that they 've done for themselves .
The worst interview I did was William <unk> .
And he 's " <unk> German . "
This man came up in six months of <unk> and Gandhi , and about this every time I asked him , he would say , " Oh , I 'm just there .
Nothing big . "
Not bad .
And I would never say I could interview a <unk> person .
These people have to understand what they do , and then they want to share those .
But inevitably it needs you to overcome all the obstacles .
All of us have <unk> and individual images , and if you get through the interview , it 's <unk> .
And the <unk> is that we 've made a good job , and everybody has a position to be able to draw .
And we all know that the <unk> , the moment of what makes us feel proud , and the key thing is that we can not make people feel <unk> .
It 's hard to be -- maybe some of you remember <unk> <unk> -- interviews hard , hard steps . That 's not bad .
But what I want to do is to ask them to say , let 's say that they 're going to be able to get out of the limits of their <unk> , as the public character , which is very uniform , and it 's really valid .
Let me tell you about the worst and best moment of the interview .
This is a little bit of a relationship on the ice that we 've seen in our <unk> .
<unk> is a brilliant woman .
Do you know if she 's going to be one of the first signs that you 're wearing .
She did a lot of things . She was a <unk> .
He wrote a fabulous portrait called Women .
She 's also a <unk> , and she 's a <unk> .
She 's the editor of the <unk> , but a very impressive woman in that era .
And I started calling her <unk> <unk> .
She 's <unk> people who are <unk> , like <unk> <unk> .
In fact , when I did the interview , I was doing a lot of <unk> in her audience , in the Arctic , sitting below the center of the brain , sat down below her .
And I thought that this should be <unk> , because I was always going to interview a few seconds before I started talking about <unk> .
At that time , we did n't communicate , because if we were to talk about it , it was really <unk> .
And then we 're very excited about that .
We sit down here , and then we 're really good .
Yves <unk> 's <unk> <unk> .
She 's wearing a beautiful <unk> .
She was going to be 80 years old , and she was about to sit there . She 's going to sit there .
And she started very <unk> . She was unbelievable .
Any problem that I asked all of that is that she 's not lying there , I 'm just going to be there -- any of you know what <unk> knows .
I was a cold , and she could n't say anything .
And I started thinking about what was going on at the moment . And then I want to understand it .
When we talk about it , I 'm a audience .
But on stage stage , I became a trained pianist .
This is the problem , she plays with me . So when I ask her a question , I do n't know what to answer . I asked her about the life of <unk> , and she 's not saying , " Well , that 's her uncle . "
There 's a lot of people thinks that I 've never seen a writer , I 'm never going to be actor . "
But I did n't ask about actors , and she went to tears and said , " Well , I have a spell .
And that 's when I was in <unk> , and I would say , " And then she 's going to go . "
And then she goes to me and said , " You know what are the actors doing ?
They <unk> me . " And she said , " You know what that is ? "
And I was struck by her attitude .
So I said , " I 'm learning . "
And she looked at me , and she was like winning a <unk> player . Next , she started telling her what real life would look like .
And this story has to be done . I 'm going to give you a little cartooning .
She 's a brilliant man .
And I did n't do that with her <unk> , but she did it in her life .
She 's a bad way -- she 's because she died her brain .
She could be the worst of the way you could think . A few few people were invited to her dinner .
She was in a strong pain .
We all know that .
She 's in her own <unk> .
The guards came up . Yves Behar 's <unk> <unk> .
It 's very uniform .
And then , at some point , the door opened , she walked out , and she was very <unk> .
She 's her beautiful man , her brilliance . She goes to everybody , and she 's going to talk to everyone . And then you go back to the room , there 's no one ever ever seen her .
She wanted to control their final moment , she did it .
There 's a couple other ways to be able to open <unk> , and I 'll just show you a little bit about it .
And this is not like the " <unk> <unk> , " but it 's really sad .
I interviewed Martin Martin . That was a long time .
And we sat down there , interviewing a few decades later , and I asked him , " <unk> <unk> , people say all the things that are bad .
Are you a childhood ? "
And he looks at me , and he 's like , " How do you ask this question ? "
And he looked at me , and did n't <unk> , " What would your childhood look like ? "
This is " <unk> <unk> , " but it 's really appropriate . I say , ' My dad 's very tired , so I 'm very boring . "
And then he looked at me and started telling his sad story .
His dad is a big <unk> , and in fact , he 's an unfortunate kid who has a bad childhood .
The question is : what does it evolve ?
These are real issues , but I want to tell you about the problems that are made from " <unk> " and the <unk> problem , which is always the question that people are waiting for .
I 've got two examples of relationships .
One of the first things that I 've done for the great American <unk> in the U.S.
His name is <unk> <unk> , and some of you might know that he probably does n't know .
And he wrote a song for Thomas <unk> , almost every life with Thomas Carroll , and I asked him , " Well , what do you think he 's doing ? "
And he said , " Of course , I do n't know what he 's trying to know , because I 've seen all his letters . "
And that means that he 's very happy to do about 50 years of relationships .
And I asked him a question .
I said , " Is that a vote ? "
This took <unk> to study apartheid and to communicate the biography , " Mmm -- " I 'm going to <unk> on the south <unk> accent .
Yves <unk> 's home in <unk> .
And he said , " Well , maybe it is . "
And he said , " You know , I 've seen all of his stuff , sometimes Jefferson , <unk> a little bit . "
And actually he 's saying that apartheid does n't think so , because he saw the letters .
And he said , " But I understand , I know , he 's understanding . "
And he said , " We do n't want to look outside the surface , and then there 's some time he does n't want a lot of positive authority . "
And then he said , " You see , John Brown is very honest . "
And then he started talking about what he 's going to say about John Berners - sponsors , and he invites me to go to his house and see his wife , her relationship from <unk> , the relationship between Charlie and sponsors .
She comes from the Eastern England area , and it 's very glamorous , but he 's an <unk> person .
But the question of that question is that the most important question I ask for that , when I mentioned this , people are going to die because of my bold , or scary , but believe me , that 's really a question to ask .
Next is <unk> de <unk> .
<unk> de <unk> is one of the most <unk> dancers in history .
She created " <unk> , " and it changed the entire U.S. .
<unk> women .
And I asked her -- by the way , I might remind her , she 's so different -- I invited her to interview and interview her .
She said , " Come on my apartment . "
She lives in New York .
" Come here , we 're 15 minutes , and we decided to continue . "
So I went to the dark side of the summer to hear her , she was lying in her bed .
And I knew that she was about 10 years ago .
And so she 's spent most of her life on the bed , but what I 'm going to say is that life -- her hair is calling off .
She did n't get to interview .
She 's sitting there , she 's got into the book , and she thinks she has the most interesting thing she had in her car , it 's her sponsors .
She was n't satisfied , but she did .
She said , " I 'm going to put the cards in the bed , and it 's the symbol of death , I keep changing it . I think it 's doing it . "
She loved <unk> .
And I thought , I would have to put her in my interview .
She agreed .
She came out , of course , sitting in the <unk> .
She 's affected by the stroke of a stroke .
And of course , she managed to prepare for the interview , but she had a huge <unk> .
And then we started talking , I asked her a unexpected question .
And I said , " Do you feel bad for yourself ? "
The audience here -- you know , they 're always standing on the <unk> , and they think it 's a problem , but the problem is she 's going to ask the question .
And she started telling her her childhood , she was beautiful , and she turned out -- although her body was very upset -- she came up with her audiences as a girl , a red girl and then she said , " That 's going to go . "
And she started talking about what she was doing with her face , she could n't expect her to look at her eyes , her family was just like a <unk> , and she 's a beautiful sister .
And she was only the only ones who did it , she did some decisions .
And the first thing is , although she ca n't be dancing , dance is still her life .
Secondly , even she was dancing , but if she could become a better , because she had nothing to do .
At the end of the childhood , she was really big .
This is a series of assignments that I 'm lucky to do .
There 's a little bit of a moment in the same moment .
<unk> is going to be " <unk> , " because everybody 's waiting in their lives , so they can adapt to the real truth , and how they 're becoming their own self - <unk> . I recommend you , even if you do n't do that .
And for your friends trying to do this , especially in my family .
Thanks very much .

And according to Peter <unk> , some of the most powerful societies in the world are <unk> the <unk> and the international company , and in this <unk> talk , <unk> <unk> demonstrates how his organization is a powerful psychic .
corruption , global issues , money , politics

Peter <unk> : How to reveal corruption
I 'm going to talk about corruption , but I want to start with two different things together .
<unk> is a huge global economy , global economic recession , and another one is very small and extremely glamorous and it 's very glamorous for the economy and the military .
This <unk> existence , basically , led to <unk> governments .
The <unk> of government expression is in many ways , like corruption and environmental damage , for women and children , and so on , in all these areas , we really need a world of <unk> political activities in the world .
And I think the effects of corruption and corruption , perhaps , is probably the most playful way of thinking about the notion that the <unk> of the government is <unk> to the government .
I 'm going to talk about my experience .
And I used to have a public service region in Nairobi , Virginia , in Nairobi .
And then I noticed that corruption , the corruption corruption of the <unk> corruption kept <unk> us .
So , I started working on the workforce of <unk> the World Bank , where our failures prevent them , but I think , we need a system that needs to be <unk> in the area of corruption to the <unk> of the world .
And yet , when I did my work , I 've got an expert in the World Bank Foundation who wrote that you do n't do it .
And that 's what you 're working on in exchange .
This is the World Wide Web , so we asked you to stop your action .
At that time , I 'm making donor meetings all over the conference , and they have a lot of people who prefer to stay in Nairobi -- it 's the world 's most safe city , but they like to sit there because other cities make people feel more comfortable .
And in these midst , I noticed that a lot of the worst projects always have been our customer , government , <unk> , and most of them are represented by the North , first <unk> .
Let me give you one example -- a huge amount of energy project , the values of 30 billion , in the world , and one of the most vulnerable ones , Kenya starts to start .
And we looked at this , and it did n't have any economic care . Nobody was buying electric power from there , Nobody is interested in <unk> projects .
Instead , we know that this project will destroy the environment , <unk> the <unk> forest , and those are the Inuit , like <unk> and <unk> .
So , everybody knows that this is not just a useless project , but it 's an absolutely scary , scary project . It 's a country that 's going to be <unk> in the future , and it will still take a lot of resources for the <unk> and the hospital , as a hospital .
We all <unk> this project . There is nothing to do with your name and that project , but it 's the first time that the project started building .
All of the projects that we 're going to do with our inheritance , but it 's been taken for a year , and you 've got to make a lot of research , but usually they 're not going to fail .
But they did n't have a lot of money , despite the fact that our economy had failed to influence the environmental environment , to make thousands of families , and all of these projects were suddenly made up of their bank bank of the bank , with the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , so that they had a very strong military transmitter in the back of Germany and so forth . They 're very quickly going to <unk> behind the military .
Now , these stores are our big companies .
They are the active drivers of the global market , as I 'm talking about .
They 're the world 's powerful company , the <unk> , from France , U.K. , Japanese and Canada , they 've got the system , large corrupt corruption that <unk> forward .
We 're not talking about five million dollars , not 10 , or a million .
We 're talking about a decade , 100,000 dollars per million dollars , they come up in the Swiss <unk> of Switzerland , and the bank accounts of the president , the Prime Minister of <unk> , at the presidency .
This is the reality that I see , and I 'm not saying I 've seen hundreds of these projects in Africa when I work on Africa .
So , I believe that this <unk> corruption is happening in the economic policy of the country , and it 's also this corruption that the corruption of this country is going to move into suffering , poverty , violence , violence and despair .
Now , we have more than a billion people that are absolute poverty below us , and we 've got over billions of people who do n't respond to the way that they 're going to be able to drink more and more , less and less people , so that women and children are in the age of five years -- and so on , there are thousands of kids who die in a huge amount of time , because there 's a lot of deaths in <unk> , which is a massive <unk> .
So why do n't the World Wide Web leave me ?
And I left the World Wide Web after a big claim .
And because of the World Wide Web , the U.S. World War II thinks that <unk> is no problem , like German .
In German , traveling to Australia .
It 's even <unk> .
And most of the Japanese , France , Britain , <unk> , all the most important international companies all over the place have to deal with authority .
I do n't say all , but most of them ca n't be left .
I call that the government <unk> , and when I arrived to build this little <unk> organization in Berlin , we 're told that we ca n't stop German , because we can lose the German .
We 're going to be <unk> French , <unk> , Japanese .
So this is something that creates a <unk> moral dilemma , and therefore the body company , or <unk> , we 're not going to continue to do this .
That 's the kind of political structure that I know , because even if it 's powerful , it can not tell us , we 're going to not allow our firms to vote in Kenya .
They need help , and these big companies are also embedded in this <unk> .
A lot of companies do n't want to kill .
For example , a lot of German companies believe they 're actually able to create <unk> , <unk> products .
They 're not going to be good at the other international players , but they do n't have the opportunity to show their own <unk> because this world is dominated by large corruption .
And what I want to say is that , as governments , civic social organization , the community of civic knowledge .
We have a small NGOs , " transparent <unk> . "
And we started thinking about the <unk> of a <unk> dilemma , and we 're starting to engage the idea of collective creativity , trying to try to make different players and explain to them , to explain what they 're going to do about what 's really good for them .
In a meeting in a conference of economic collaboration in 1997 , it makes all sorts of <unk> to change the laws of law .
Thank you , I think it 's fun , and we have to sit with these companies .
We have a few <unk> of <unk> in Berlin and 20 professions , and we 're going to talk about how to deal with them .
And we have three <unk> of meetings in the first meetings .
A <unk> from the Royal <unk> of Von Neumann is the first meeting of <unk> entrepreneurs , because they do n't habit to interact with NGOs .
And in the first meeting , they 're doing what they do n't do . That 's a meditation .
That 's what other cultures asked .
They do n't even even like this .
In fact , people are still fighting today .
And there 's a lot of people who do n't believe that somebody 's failed .
But in the second meeting , they 've been convinced that they do n't do that , not going to happen to other countries , like German , U.K. , etc .
And they answered this .
In the last conference , in the <unk> , we 've asked all of them to have a lot of money for the government , and I want to offer them for development .
This is a source of <unk> soft , because we can make them sure they have to meet us .
We have better longevity .
We 're going to have a wider population of <unk> .
That 's why laws change .
And that 's why <unk> comes out of the problem . This is why you get <unk> right now .
In some other countries , the development of development has n't been done yet .
I , in fact , civic social rights in the Middle East .
And for example , in London , the <unk> of <unk> , from the big corruption of the Grand Canyon , had never been trying to go through the office , and they had tried to try to do it every 10 years , 10 million dollars a year , a hundred million years ago , for a few decades .
In this case , they did n't get <unk> in England .
Why ? Because the authorities thinks that <unk> is the security of the British people .
The civic society is <unk> , trying to find a solution in the U.K. , in Japan , where there 's no control , and so on .
In German , we 're trying to <unk> the <unk> of the United States , and this is a segment of the channel . This is a blackboard .
German German did n't go .
Why ? Because it 's the equivalent of what it means to be a <unk> <unk> .
In the German system , you do n't have an authority , but you can fight a license .
This is <unk> by the German law , and the staff of Parliament do n't want to change this , which is why Germany ca n't afford to avoid the United States . And this is the world 's most powerful moral moral <unk> , but it 's a world of <unk> <unk> .
I saw my time .
Let me try to summarize what happens .
I do n't believe we have the other areas that we 're fighting with corruption .
Now , the United Nations has completely been on us .
The World Wide World Bank is from <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and I say , the most powerful <unk> of the world .
Most of the big companies now are completely ignorant of what they need to do to make a strong policy , and so on .
This is possible to do it , because civic social society provides a lot of the government to analyze the solution to the challenge , and then <unk> reform over after , then <unk> reform .
Of course , if civic social society wants to participate in it , there 's enough responsibility .
Not all social social organization are challenging .
Three years is also a non - governmental organization .
So , we have to realize that <unk> society is constantly evolving .
They have a lot of resistance .
They have a lot of high - speed management . In many <unk> societies .
We also need more <unk> social leaders .
This is why we built schools in Berlin and <unk> centers , because we believe that most of the education and the <unk> , in the German district , from <unk> and Europe , are not paying attention enough to focus on social societies .
But from very realistic experience , if citizens are good at the top , and relates to other people , especially with the government , governments and their international institutions , most of the values of social values , in this community , to create a better world of values .
Thank you .
<unk>
It 's the filmmakers filmmakers in Zambia , <unk> <unk> , and brought us into the world of dynamic , three big <unk> of <unk> -- the " <unk> " methods , " and the way the pressure is <unk> in the next week of the week .
Africa , creativity , culture , entertainment , film , global issues , media , technology
<unk>
Yves <unk> tells the story of urgency
I have a story for you .
A story about Africa .
A story about hope and <unk> .
<unk> Hollywood .
And then there 's <unk> .
We have a third of the world 's three - big number of women in the world today .
In 2006 , it 's about 2,000 movies .
Suppose it 's about 40 or 50 movies a week in Oxford , in the streets of Nigeria and West Africa .
There are two million dollars of value in this industry .
It creates at least thousands of jobs .
And this is still growing up .
But notice that this is a movement from the ground .
There is no government oversight , and indeed , it 's completely <unk> that it happens in the most difficult moment in Nigeria .
There 's 15 years of <unk> .
So you might wonder why you live in the Boston film in Italy , right ?
I think I have to tell you a little bit about my life , because I think there 's a relationship .
Most of my life lives in Zambia , and I live in South Asia .
My dad was mostly in East Africa .
And I was born to Zambia .
But I did n't get out there , but I really felt that Africa was a huge life .
It 's the place I learned to walk .
And the rest of the family came up with their first house .
So when we go back to Italy , one of the most profound things about my mind is that my family is hard to share stories with people .
It seems to us that the African and friends of our neighbors are alone in the world , and it 's not the place where they 're all suffering from their imagination , or the famine , and there 's a lot of famine in the world , as well as the richest ones and the famine .
So we 're always born <unk> <unk> .
I remember a very strong wish , which is to talk about where Africa is the same thing that we 've been born with .
So when I saw a story about <unk> , I know that this is a very glamorous opportunity to tell the story of the opposite .
And I 'm going to tell you a story about how a African story can tell me that it 's actually a kind of inspired .
I was doing a award for the <unk> center in <unk> Art Center .
We see how to change the change , and young independent filmmakers can make low cost .
So when I proposed this story , I got special support of this film .
And not only supported me , but I 've got two great partnerships to start with me .
A very talented <unk> -- one of my friends 's friends and mentors : Robert <unk> , who is a man who says , ' National <unk> ' " ] [ " Academy <unk> <unk> " makes a " national " " state , " and I 'm not sure I 've met it .
So we came up in August of 2005 .
And he 's a clever producer to meet with the Buddha .
We 're going to show you an extraordinary view of migration , and we 're looking at the process of shooting at a process called " <unk> . "
It 's about police corruption .
He 's only nine days old .
We think this is a good story .
And at the same time , we 've also seen a lot of <unk> .
I do n't want to make a lot of hope .
I 'm just going to show you six minutes .
That 's a five - year - old audience .
This is a documentary that has several themes to show you .
And I think that 's the world .
" <unk> on the image . "
You can get a bad movie in Nigeria .
They can do it .
We 've taken a lot of money on the movie .
We 're not at the top of the list of people who live in the glass rooms .
They can watch " Machine <unk> " and whatever they 're interested in .
And I think that in Nigeria , it 's a film that 's going to be used for the people who live in this business , and they 're doing it for a living .
It 's more glamorous than the <unk> of Hollywood , the better news of the Hollywood <unk> , because you have a <unk> capital .
And here you take a film here , and if you 're a good movie , you immediately have the next panel , because you do n't have a movie .
We should do it .
I believe <unk> forces .
I mean , 90 percent of the people are watching films .
And I think that this is the best possible way to use this information information .
So if you take a film , whatever you need to do is have a <unk> factor .
And of course , you have to report .
He need a lot of time .
And I 've tried to explain that the problem for people is not a quality of the quality , the quality of the quality .
I mean , some movies are made of mass quality , but first you 'll remember Africa 's life , just one dollar day , and those people are really the ones who are these films .
It 's an amazing industrial industry that has just been born on the world .
Because nobody believes meditation can go out of Africa .
But the story of our film is <unk> people .
These stories are about their , for them .
So when they look at these stories , they always look at these stories .
<unk> , fun , interesting .
This kind of comedy is huge .
They get intimacy .
We 've always been born with poverty .
They 're always looking at the center of the film .
We can do something .
We can make things , as the world sees , they 'll say , wow , that 's Nigeria .
Okay , <unk> .
You have your own <unk> .
Come on , <unk> , return , come back .
Now you go on the streets , you see patterns .
That 's not the film .
What you see here is the living .
And you see how he talked about it .
He has a huge impact on you .
It 's not just what you see in the film .
It 's not that you hear from the West .
<unk> , goodbye .
<unk>
I used to be proud of those Western seals .
But when I realized that my country was corrupt .
A young man wants to figure out how to do bad things .
But I do n't .
And then I found that I could get a hero who did n't have a crime , or a <unk> person .
That 's what I call myself .
Let 's start .
Okay , so we did .
So here you are .
<unk> : <unk> .
They made the film very well when they make films .
But here we have to do it here , to think , for example , <unk> <unk> .
And they say , well , immediately , you see <unk> , and you ca n't see it , but we use <unk> methods .
What I 'm worried about is <unk> flying .
And that 's why I have to use enough of <unk> .
<unk> can live .
So , let me bring it to me .
I 'm just telling her that she 's going to get out of the right place , trying to figure out your face .
She 's a professional , and she knows what to do .
But I have to protect my face .
That 's not the last film .
You know , this is an academic , it 's a glamorous place .
Now you 're going to see how we make films or whatever other people are helping .
<unk>
Stop .
There are lots of times .
There 's a lot of theme there .
I ca n't wait . I just wanted to say one thing .
And I was working with these actors , and I spent a couple of weeks , they 've got a problem with the <unk> of the West , which is a Western director , like America or Europe .
But they 're always doing <unk> , passion with <unk> .
The German movies made <unk> <unk> said that I need a book , like you need oxygen .
And I think they 're breathing .
The Japanese filmmakers are really doing what 's going on .
So the film is important for them to be very important about their audiences .
A woman told me , " When I look at a remix , I can relax , really breathing more .
Another important thing about this is I hope to have a better audience today .
And it 's technology , I 'm interested in this , and I believe digital <unk> is a very serious clip of the film , which is now the cost of film .
This is a fabulous camera for five dollars per year .
Technology makes huge ideas of creativity .
And guess what ?
We do n't have to tell about Nigeria .
And they understood and they get involved in technology , they 're using technology .
And I hope it can be done .
I hope that there are other countries that can be inspired by the world , in Nigeria , for example , to the role of the film , creating jobs for the people who are working on their own people , and to make the stories that make them active , <unk> the story of their culture .
But I think that strategy is more encouraging .
I do think of propaganda as well .
My characters are friends , people who see scholars , they are <unk> , and they 're doing what we really want to do .
So I think that 's what we learned from them .
And one thing that I 'm going to show you is that a small challenge can make us tell stories of stories .
And I think this is the theme of this presentation .
Think about a food and shelter that 's only the only purpose . There is no story .
There 's no story about the story .
No <unk> , no myth .
Nothing .
No novel .
It 's hard to imagine , right ? Stop .
So that 's what I think .
And I think that the key to a health society is a group of people who have a <unk> story , and I believe that Nigeria film is <unk> this .
I want you to hear their voice .
It 's just a couple of weeks .
It 's not an ideal leader ; it 's just about propaganda .
<unk> is the best thing they did .
And if you have a kind of industrial commitment to the face , it 's propaganda .
I think it 's going to happen , and we do n't have a better movie , and we 'll have <unk> <unk> movies .
And of course , the fundamental theme remains .
Sorry , sport .
But we 're telling these stories , Nigeria , the way we do it .
We have a diverse culture , and we do n't think we can <unk> these stories .
And my mission is to make a difference .
I 'm really keen that the future will have a lot of cooperation that we can learn .
I really want it .
Thank you so much .
Chris Anderson : Wait . I have two questions .
<unk> , you 're not going to be the third big <unk> on the world .
So what does this mean in the film ?
<unk> : Yeah , I 've talked about it briefly , about 2,000 movies .
There 's scientific data .
Are you a year per year ?
Right , 2,000 <unk> , 20 percent of the <unk> boss -- <unk> <unk> .
We know that number is much more than that .
So you can certainly have 2,000 .
Think about 45 movies a week .
There 's a lot of challenges . There are challenges .
And the quality of the film is worth improving , they have to go to more specialization , but I 'm really optimistic .
<unk> : Are n't you going to make films in <unk> ?
E : Yes , of course , that 's important .
Think about the film directly in the market .
They sold in <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> .
<unk> : What form way ?
<unk> : <unk> , yeah , thank you .
It 's a CD , but it 's more filling .
They started using <unk> .
They 're actually not waiting for the latest technology .
They start from 1995 , Chicago .
There are five <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
In fact , it 's a kind of an envelope , a compressed lift .
<unk> : Can the movies sell ?
<unk> : You 're probably going to meet you in Canada , and you might have seen movies , or bananas , water . Yes .
And I have to say , it 's a story that tells you that it is a commodity .
There is no story .
<unk> : Yeah , thank you so much .
<unk>
And the architect was Frank , and he took you to the early <unk> of his interview -- from his <unk> in Jerusalem to Paris in the city .
architecture , collaboration , design , global issues , technology
<unk>
The <unk> was rejected .
I 'm going to start with the slide .
And what I 'm going to show you is what 's going on in these slides is very direct .
And my idea is , at least in my mind , it 's all <unk> to the reality of reality .
And either I 'm convinced that the customer is trying to solve the problem , or whether I really help them solve problems , because they often look really happy .
So look at the slides .
Can you turn it off ?
I love in the dark .
I do n't want you to see what I 'm doing here .
All right , I built this house in <unk> , and I became <unk> .
In fact , it came out of an <unk> comics , which is the slide on the right .
This is in Florida .
And I 'm going to show you that I have a sense of thinking about the environment .
The slide on the left is made up of these little buildings , and I try to build a building for this building in the background .
When people look at this scene , they look very funny , and my theory is that they 're more interested in the inside of that space .
And once I 've completed the environment , I 'm going to start creating a comfortably , tasty space , as the second slide on the right .
Next , I designed the design of <unk> Island in Los Angeles .
And what I 'm looking at is how to study a space for the law .
We 're still working with the clients now .
This building is now building right now .
The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- it 's going to be the end of the last street , and some <unk> will be in the street . That 's the campus .
And those are the ones who have been told that they 're going to be completely overwhelmed with the <unk> .
They want to think about space .
So the idea is that we 're all going to create a kind of <unk> , a very difficult environment in downtown downtown .
And my theory , or my opinions , is no longer sustainable .
So I tried to <unk> the buildings , and I 'm going to leave you with those buildings everywhere .
In the ' 60s , I started designing furniture furniture , and some things I made in <unk> was a very good thing .
We even use the floor , even the walls and everything .
So the success success of furniture made me shocked .
And I do n't accept that so successful as an architect , and I have no sense of <unk> , so I 'm going to start with no furniture .
So nobody likes it .
And so this is , in those furniture , and what I did before I was .
And after we failed , I quit .
And on the left panel , the piece of furniture that ended up becoming the right part of the world , and he 's going to make a baby that 's going to smash with the garbage .
And so I put around the rest of the world , as you see , I realize that it can sit in and it 's solid and strong .
So this is an accident .
I have interested in fish .
I 'm going to say , " Well , I 've got a hundred million years old , and I told you about five billion dollars a year , if you want to die .
So I started making these funny things .
And the result that they 're evolving , the more they evolve , is the glass of the <unk> art , the same blue - art sculpture .
And then I <unk> it to the whole thing , trying to convert it into the kind of knowledge that I learned in the fish and the relationship between the <unk> and motion .
There 's a openness to a lot of architecture -- and this is what 's called the <unk> , and I 'm going to take advantage of the idea of a building , just a solution .
And I designed this building in Japan .
In <unk> , someone took me to dinner , and we had just <unk> with a small restaurant .
I love Japanese <unk> and <unk> beef .
And then I went off -- and I had <unk> -- somebody made me draw on the plate .
So I was painting out of some of the <unk> , and I did something like this .
The customer says , " Why do n't you get fish ? "
So I was painting , and I left Japan .
And three weeks later , I got a whole whole painting saying , " We won a lesson . "
Now the problem is that , the shape of fish is really hard to transform because they 're beautiful -- it 's perfect -- hard -- difficult , or something like that .
<unk> , a colleague of mine , and I told me that this is impossible , so that 's a much more exciting thing to do .
But he was right -- I do n't know how to deal with it .
And I did a good job , but I do n't know what to do .
It 's a problem .
The one on the right is a snake substance , one pyramid .
And I put them together . I can walk on the middle .
This is a conversation with the background .
If you look at this image of the <unk> record , they do n't show the background , so you feel " God , this guy will <unk> . "
But a friend of mine came up there for four hours looking for that garage .
They did n't get it .
So that 's okay .
<unk> and technology , all of the things that you 're talking about , is really clear .
This thing is built in six months .
We take the <unk> of the gel , which is -- we use the magic of accounting , and we used to make sculptures that we 've engineered , to scan it .
We made a coat of fish and <unk> .
And when we 're there , everything is very good at the end .
So I decided to turn and <unk> the tail .
And I did this on the left , and I put up the exhibition in the <unk> art exhibition .
I think this is one of the most beautiful things I 've ever done .
And then Jay <unk> , one of my friends and clients invited me to design his buildings in Los Angeles .
Since some of the reasons I do n't want to say , it 's going to turn out .
<unk> <unk> , I guess it is major .
So we built a solid building -- and I 'm more good at the <unk> , and it 's a very good thing to put in a room .
And finally Jay <unk> me to my own <unk> , Canada in Canada .
There 's a story -- real stories -- my grandmother had a <unk> , she bought a car . I was a child , and I 'm a kid .
I play with fish .
And then Einstein goes down , and the next day , the fish has gone .
In <unk> , we ate <unk> .
This is the internal <unk> that I did for <unk> 's offices .
He did n't buy a sculpture , so I did it .
And I found a <unk> in Toronto , and I went to my grandmother , and I took this <unk> .
This is a joke .
And I play with the guy with <unk> .
We are the old ones .
We do something together .
A few years ago , we came up with a <unk> in Italy , " <unk> <unk> . "
Most of the images are <unk> , but those two kids are playing with his son , and they 're <unk> <unk> .
And he 's <unk> .
He 's a guy who sells <unk> , and she thinks it 's an artist .
It 's called " <unk> . "
It 's a <unk> building for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The light folds in the last end .
And it 's a beautiful thing to do , because I 'm involved in building it .
I can tell you -- this is all <unk> .
You do n't have any relationships for me .
And the only thing I did was I made the youngsters back , and I would let it go , I loved sailing .
We made it <unk> <unk> .
You know I 've done something like this .
And I have this because the curiosity of the culture is so much more powerful as a result of a lot of <unk> .
People hate <unk> .
And so I 'm fascinated by this phenomenon , like <unk> furniture -- that 's kind of a material .
And I 've always been fooled .
So I had a lot of bad stuff , and I did n't forgive .
But <unk> allows it to <unk> it in the <unk> .
It 's very expensive .
This ca n't even be the most important .
And then we designed a school for cancers .
And you can see that we start with design .
Of course , milk seals . Of course .
But the idea is that we 're going to <unk> the building with the building .
Like <unk> -- like a whole painting of <unk> .
It looks like we 're working together .
And then Jay <unk> asked me to design this building in this funny place , and I started building these three things that you get into the middle .
Jay asked me how I did the building .
And he pushed me .
I have a big idea -- OK , another idea .
I had the glasses of the <unk> , and I would n't get rid of them .
When the telescope <unk> this telescope , when he gave me the first model .
And this allows me to look at architecture .
That 's the process that makes the whole thing more interesting .
This is the building on the left .
I still think that the picture of the book will be the telescope <unk> -- " This is what the hell is . "
I used to use a lot of metal in my work with a lot of metal in my work .
And the opposite of my house is also the same amount of <unk> that I have to feel frustrated about .
I said , " I ca n't get the mechanism I want to use . "
There 's a lot of models associated with <unk> and <unk> , and lots of artists made beautiful art and sculptures .
I bet the metal is because it 's used for the materials that make architecture <unk> .
It 's a kind of a <unk> metal metal , and it can also be used in the panels .
And the <unk> workers , most of the time , are doing <unk> behind the ceiling , and so on .
I have a chance to design a exhibition for <unk> <unk> , and what I do is , in Washington , I 'm doing this kind of stuff : they 're a member of my future and help me do the future .
And this is a piece of a good approach to this building , and it 's interested in building the metal .
I 'll tell you this story .
It 's a communication tool , at least with some people who are very important for building architecture .
<unk> is connected to the building -- <unk> Miller .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
There 's this kind of <unk> philosophy , which is one of the places that people have .
And they 're <unk> , but they want to have a <unk> who has a good job for someone who has a <unk> job .
So there was no village in this project , and you had to close it down .
It 's <unk> <unk> .
And I use the <unk> , and I 'm very low , so I 'm not going to pretend that you 're <unk> .
I 've spent a lot of time climbing the <unk> of Richard <unk> .
Everybody wants to do it , and I try to try and make them tick and <unk> them .
It turns out that it 's a rock .
Here 's the center region .
There 's a slope .
This little <unk> is designed by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> help me .
And before I get my work , I asked my clients to do this with me .
Because that 's exactly what we 're talking about . Maybe this is probably a metaphor for cities .
So Yves came up with this one .
We interact with the phone .
He proposed his design .
And he did a <unk> building and a leopard .
And I told him , " No , no , this is complex .
I do n't want the tower .
So he <unk> the building more simple , but he designed some funny details and <unk> his buildings .
So I decided to give him some color .
I designed a hole for him .
So he designed the <unk> bridge -- this is happening in a few weeks .
And so he designed the <unk> , and he was <unk> .
And I put this big <unk> on the back .
I called it " David and <unk> . "
This is a restaurant that I designed .
On the left , it 's a Japanese building in Boston .
This is one of the famous buildings under the highway , and we <unk> <unk> , cleaning it and repair it -- and I thought -- I think -- with the building of a building , it 's a <unk> .
My design is a little bit better , but I use this beautiful material that 's going to happen in a hundred years .
And it 's not like <unk> , in 10 to 15 years .
We <unk> the side of the building , and we designed the windows size to <unk> space .
This is a design that allows us to be surprised by Boston and ourselves , because the design of Boston is very glamorous , and they normally think that my design is n't satisfied .
We 're very careful on the details of <unk> , and then we <unk> them into the structure of the building .
In <unk> <unk> , I designed a Hollywood nut , " <unk> " and then design a building , and they built this building .
And I took this picture every night .
But they <unk> the size of a third of my models .
And then there 's the metal and the wind , and this is in the U.S.
This is a laser laboratory in the University of <unk> , and this project came out of the abstract image of a fish in the architecture .
It 's not going to happen in the lab .
That 's the shape of fish .
I just need a couple of points .
It 's all the mechanical components .
And behind the <unk> is a <unk> -- so I grabbed this opportunity because this form does n't need any glue or <unk> .
This sent me to a sculpture opportunity .
This is a little house , somewhere in somewhere .
They 've got a long time . I forgot where I was .
This is <unk> in <unk> .
We went from the stream building building buildings -- building pipelines to <unk> .
This is a pattern image .
And the truth is , there 's this very clever building building .
It reminds me why I 'm in a similar house like this .
When you have to use <unk> , you 're hard to get something perfect .
This is the bottom line of the <unk> , and you 're going to come from the top of a living room with a picture of the bottom on the side .
It 's a little town .
I was asked to design a <unk> hospital for <unk> .
I think let me do it right now .
This is the house on <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> had a <unk> -- they asked the <unk> to design .
But this is <unk> .
By the way , he never wrote me .
And we ended up doing it very well , because the <unk> of <unk> is how you 're going to build a building that does n't look like architecture ?
Otherwise this beautiful <unk> is n't looking like a building ?
And so on .
You understand that .
So we designed it .
<unk> is art .
And then the last thing we did was we succeeded in <unk> , and all of the <unk> were in the side .
When you go around the buildings , it looks very open .
<unk> is the metal , the brown minister of the <unk> Empire of Finland .
We 're going to take college church , and do n't work .
So I tried to try and try .
In this project we understood how to deal with this material .
This is in <unk> , on the left , on the left .
It was n't completed .
You know , you can see these new building structures .
And we have the opportunity to build a building on this space .
There 's a <unk> here .
This is City Hall , and here 's the city .
The <unk> of the shopping malls kept out .
The <unk> of design did n't build it , but we did it .
There 's a building in this building , and we have this <unk> , which is a little bit of a technique .
And this is the foundation of the design of our design .
We work with <unk> , and we put folds in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is connected by a C.
You get to the Grand Canyon .
So this is a 10-year - shaped curve .
The space on the bottom is the museum and a glamorous <unk> .
There 's a lot of bad news for bad effects .
And this is a hotel .
So we 've managed to think about the scale of the new building , which is to start building buildings in the building building structures , <unk> Fox and <unk> design , design design .
It 's not easy to do .
In this project I was sick .
This is a shot in <unk> .
This is a very old project , and it 's almost a lot of <unk> in the city that I designed to design in my own inner area of the ice and the <unk> of a leopard and several <unk> across the underside of this area , which is built on the left .
And then she found me that I was <unk> or how barren , and she asked me to design this bridge .
We <unk> the idea of 70 percent of the solution and the process of <unk> change .
From the bottom of the helicopter back , I put the whole building on the ground , and you see the site in the middle of this photo , where you 're looking at the building . And then you 've got <unk> and <unk> , which is made out of <unk> .
So that 's what it is .
<unk> is a request for the clients .
She 's going to have a <unk> in the bush .
She does n't care about it .
And if you 're standing in this <unk> <unk> , I hope that I 'm not there .
And I went on for her to her , but she said I did n't do that .
But when you 're in that <unk> , you feel a little bit like a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> spaces .
And the <unk> around the neighborhood came to create a <unk> .
And on top of it , there 's a side of a garden and a other side .
This slide is good .
And I do n't know how to fix it .
Notice the slide on the right .
Here it is .
On the left , my right hand .
Well , you go into a beautiful garden .
This is a living man .
The <unk> room .
One of the <unk> is <unk> , and she 's in the <unk> .
And then you go into living , and so on .
This is the <unk> .
You 're on top of the tube and you go into the <unk> , and then you 're the lake .
This is in the back of this space , in the back of the space .
And these things like <unk> are designed to be designed and creating better rooms in this area of <unk> .
The material material is <unk> <unk> , and the buildings in Boston .
So our intent is to make a little bit of a hundred feet deep across 250 feet long , and it 's a way to get into the area and put it into space and <unk> the <unk> and the restaurants in space .
And I did n't put my <unk> on a <unk> .
Take a look at a free <unk> painting .
And my concept is , <unk> <unk> you can see outside the kitchen .
It turns out that <unk> <unk> -- the trees are highly <unk> , and it creates a pretty good space .
You feel like you 're in your own village .
This is <unk> <unk> -- Alaska .
We worked with him .
In California , this is the building of the ice .
From the bridge , you 're going to move through the <unk> , and it 's another bridge that is the same bridge .
You 're very tired of this room , and this building is reflecting this movement .
There are more people in the back of the building , the <unk> , the restaurants , the things .
And this thing -- hope you 're driving through the <unk> of the sound , the ice effects in these islands .
Something like a little bit .
This is the project that I did in the Swiss subway clinics in Switzerland .
We 're very upset with architecture .
These are the early ones , and the problem is they sell furniture to ordinary people , so if my design is too glamorous , they 're going to say , well , their furniture seems to look at their house .
And so in the second phase of the three - dimensional building , then we designed our meetings into a <unk> , and the public space would be able to do something that could <unk> <unk> .
From the office , it 's been created by the interaction between different videos .
This is in Paris .
Yves <unk> 's <unk> group and <unk> de <unk>
Yves <unk> -- moving here -- move here .
There 's a new library in the river .
And in this side , we 've designed a high - scale street center in the middle of the city , and there 's a piece of a theater , the apartments , our kidneys and the art and a art museum , so far -- density , <unk> , <unk> .
It 's very , very nervous , and it 's very nervous .
And in the <unk> , it 's a very , very good place to get rid of this beautiful space .
They are oppressed by the <unk> .
And this is something that really bothers me how to stop this .
These models for this work .
Another model I 've just put on this -- this is the way I 'm self - <unk> to painting the painting so I understand the problem .
I tried to avoid this leopard -- how do you do it ?
<unk> are like this .
These are research I did .
That 's a very bad one on the left .
And you can see why this scheme is built , I think .
But in this case , the solution came out in front of the <unk> , and in the middle of the street , interacting with the other axis .
And this is the surface of the <unk> and <unk> , like a kangaroo , and she put me into <unk> .
This is here -- apartments and theater , whatever .
These are all handmade of <unk> , France , looking at the metal .
It 's on the side of the city .
And so my concept is to <unk> the energy of architecture .
And on the other side of the street , it 's much more important than me , except I put some <unk> into the roof , and these seals are made for some kind of punishment .
And this will be a kind of <unk> billboard .
If you have anyone who has designed it .
Believe me , I do n't know what to do .
Jay <unk> is a person who loves <unk> , and he hired me to design this inner city .
And this design has also been <unk> .
I always tell myself , this is the last fish .
This is a little bit of a <unk> .
I would n't do it again -- I do n't want to do that anymore .
And then I did .
That 's it .
But this is the living room .
This is -- I do n't know what this is .
And I added it to this because we have enough budgets , and then I can remove something .
This is Europe <unk> , and everyone in Europe is working together .
We 've done a lot of fun together .
I think they 're X - <unk> , and I do n't know what to do , but I 'm not sure why we 're together and so reliable .
Now far something happened .
This is a marketplace .
And you 're going to go into the magic of the magic , the <unk> , the <unk> .
This is a shopping ride with a leopard and some restaurants .
This is a restaurant .
So what I did -- because of the sky in Paris , I designed a <unk> light <unk> on the train path .
It 's a little bit like this before , and it 's going to be there .
This <unk> will form light in the evening .
In Switzerland -- in fact , it 's essentially German -- we 've designed a <unk> and a piece of furniture .
And I tried -- this is the building of <unk> <unk> , and there 's also a <unk> sculpture , trying to make a kind of <unk> relationship .
And I 'm not going to show you that -- this project is completed -- but this building , and this is the <unk> .
When you go through it -- these are the ones that look like natural growth , and then you get part of the whole system .
The material is <unk> and <unk> .
You wonder , if this is a museum , what would it look like ?
If this is a little bit crazy , you 're not going to show you what it looks like .
I was <unk> and smart -- I designed it .
It 's a little <unk> from the outside .
It 's basically three square rooms and some <unk> , and so on .
From the building , it looks like a floating ice sheet .
I found myself up .
You see , on the right hand side , there 's this picture on the left side of the picture .
So it 's very silent .
This is <unk> Brown .
This project is complex .
There is a <unk> .
And it <unk> with love and kindness and attention to <unk> .
That 's not an architectural building , but I 'm going to get closer and closer to it to create a relationship between the building .
And the plane -- this is a Hewlett - Packard street .
This is the <unk> , like a garden .
It took advertising on the ground .
This is the offices , actually , we do n't really do design design .
Finally , this is a hotel .
These are some of the sorts of relationships associated with <unk> , and that 's something that connects them to a kind of relationship between the <unk> museum and the museum of the art museum .
We 've done this with <unk> <unk> , and we 've got the standard design program , which is <unk> competition , and we found that it does n't work .
But you all love this form and it 's the question of competition .
You 're trying to make your plan .
We did a lot of research .
This is our first prototype .
This is the three - <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> halls , CNN parks , Boston parks and Berlin concert halls .
You all love the flow of the circle .
In fact , this is the big <unk> of the <unk> , but it <unk> as a few others , because it made the <unk> <unk> .
And our clients do n't like <unk> , and when we compare to the new <unk> expert , he told me that this shape is appropriate , and it 's appropriate .
And we tried a lot of shape , and we wanted to think of the first time that we could get the first way to get into a <unk> .
And ultimately , we decided that the ratio of the shape <unk> <unk> is <unk> the <unk> , and the expert said that it 's important to say that this is really important , but we 're doing it .
And our concept is to do a lot of <unk> with <unk> <unk> , like <unk> in the <unk> room .
This is our idea .
And then in the corner , the <unk> is the weight of the limb .
And the good news is , no matter where you 're sitting in the middle of the room , you have a feeling that you 're going to make in the stage .
That , that 's not the end of the project -- it 's still going to be changing , so that it 's not so important for this space .
We 've studied by some kind of <unk> devices , and they 're using the laser to look at what 's going to require a <unk> .
But you can understand it from the halls of halls .
Most Hewlett - Packard is a <unk> <unk> on the stage on the stage .
In this design we open the entire stage , and we put it on the board .
So it makes a very different body .
And the beginning of the design , because it 's a bit of a frog , so it <unk> <unk> , and it 's really good .
When you put it into an electric box , it 's more difficult -- you can see how you 're going to put it in a hotel .
This is the teapot I 'm wearing .
I 'm going to <unk> it directly .
But that 's the way I do my work , and I 'm not going to show you that I 've got a couple of times .
And of course , it does n't look like this , but that 's the way I do it .
And finally , this is in Los Angeles , and I 'm invited to design a sculpture that 's in Los Angeles .
Larry Burns on this kind of stuff .
And they made me design a fish so I designed a snake .
This is a public space , and I 've done a similar building for the garden .
This is a half - thousand <unk> , Larry Page , and there 's a lot of water that 's used over here .
In <unk> people called me a fish , and we 're designing this in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So the design of <unk> <unk> was done with Yves <unk> , which did n't have <unk> spray , as well as old as old .
So we came up with this <unk> language language , and then she converted it , turning it into a fish that was a little bit like a <unk> of the 19th century , which is <unk> -- it 's a riot , <unk> , that 's actually an <unk> shopping malls .
We put these things up .
And this is the beginning of a <unk> .
And then we cut it into a lot of <unk> for a lot of <unk> .
And so we 've got to show you a little bit about the hotel , and they 're scared of it , say , because this fish will not get to <unk> .
And finally , I took this design for <unk> <unk> .
I 'm not going to depend on <unk> <unk> here , but this is the building that I 've designed for <unk> .
A little abode studio , unfortunately , is being sold .
<unk>
This is what I did with my son .
And he designed this head , and it 's a robot that 's going to move around with other things .
The food is still the same thing , so the restaurants are very failures .
Ben should be the first first thing to be food to eat .
It 's about <unk> .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
David <unk> , in the ' 80s , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> " is made by <unk> by Thomas Dolby and <unk> .
future , music , performance , society
<unk>
David <unk> on flowers <unk>
You know , I 'm going to be a little bit like a <unk> of Adam and <unk> , which is beautiful , so beautiful and strong , and so forth from the beginning of the dinosaur , where the car is moving through the dinosaurs , what 's going on ? And they 've seen that there 's no <unk> -- you see what you 're seeing here , if you saw it , you 've figured out whether you can see the <unk> ? You see it ?
<unk>
The Kitchen of the world is <unk> about 200 million people per year , MIT engineers , <unk> Smith , and shares a very simple <unk> : <unk> agriculture <unk> .
Featured , MacArthur grant , <unk> , death , design , engineering , global issues , invention , industrial design
Two
<unk> Smith : <unk> with you , <unk> <unk> .
I said that I 'm going to talk to you about one of my favorite projects .
I think it 's what I do right now , and I 'm excited about the easiest project .
This is probably possible to influence the world .
It 's one of the most serious health problems in the world , and what is the number of <unk> deaths ?
All right , it 's <unk> the <unk> of the kitchen , and what do you believe ?
And I felt so sad .
Can we make a more clean <unk> ?
A better <unk> ?
So why do you kill 200 million people every year ?
And I know that Bill Joy and I tell you that I 'm going to talk to you about <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
This is a picture of a Haiti village in Haiti , 98 percent of all the shelves from the Oxford village .
And it 's all about the <unk> of the Central Pacific .
This has all sorts of environmental problems and some other problems in Haiti .
A few years ago , a <unk> accident came up with thousands of lives of life , and this is because the mountains did n't have <unk> soil .
So once you zoom in , the rain soil goes directly into the river , and the water is <unk> .
And the main thing here is that people do n't need fuel , so people put it on the ground .
It does n't value the environment .
They understand that the environment is important , but they 're oppressed .
There is no such thing , no fossil fuels , not very good .
So this is something like a <unk> .
And <unk> saw the trees in the forest , and <unk> the tree .
There 's no problem that people are struggling to find this amount of fuel .
Four years ago , I went and worked with a group of students in Haiti and locally .
There was a volunteer in his village .
And then you get rid of the <unk> , and you get <unk> .
But it was empty .
Our students are going to depend on a little bit of little changes , and then its efficiency is increasing .
They were very excited .
And then they 're going to go back to the <unk> building for the first time .
And it turns out that these things could n't burn .
The students were shocked .
And if you look at it carefully , you 'll see that " U.S. American <unk> . "
They did n't have anything in that village .
And maybe this is a good thing to do with the government , so that the volunteers are going to go back to the town to return to that village , and then governments are in the village .
So we 're trying to get a better way to make fuel emissions .
We want this new fossil fuels .
There are hundreds of thousands of <unk> around the streets .
And these <unk> are <unk> , and the rest of the <unk> is called " <unk> . "
It does n't work , and it 's not a good thing to do .
They 're going to stack up the tips , and they 're able to hide in the <unk> .
And we think we 're going to be able to make all these people who are capable of doing fuel .
In the next few years , I was working with my students right now .
First of all , we put it in a <unk> , and it 's a good thing to do , with an abandoned 55 million gallons of 55 gallons per gallon .
And then we paste , let 's zoom in a little bit of <unk> , and then it 's going to take the <unk> out of the air and do it in the end .
But this is a bad thing , because it 's made of <unk> , and the water is <unk> .
So we managed to get rid of it .
In fact , one of my students was <unk> to remember that his mother gave him a dish , called " <unk> <unk> , " which is a very glamorous <unk> .
So we 've got to find out that the Haiti is growing , and it 's just going to be <unk> , but they 're not going to be different .
There 's a lot of places in the world , and it 's the same thing , although the name is <unk> , everything is about <unk> .
And you can put it on top of it , and this is the pump , and you can put it on top .
So we did that , and we went to Haiti .
These are graduate students in the college School , and so , I 'm a mentor of MIT 's mentors .
These are the ones that we do .
Now we 're going to see that in Asia , India is the most frequently <unk> fuel fuel in India .
This is the <unk> of the city , and you see , health problem is because it 's burning sugar or other creatures .
Kids and women are affecting women because they 're often in the kitchen .
We want to look at whether we can introduce the previous technology .
Anyway , India does n't have any lips , but they do n't .
We 're still curiously aggressive .
This is the <unk> and <unk> of the wing .
So with a little cow , the cow is just doing it directly directly .
We 've done some kind of stuff , and you can see the <unk> and the cow .
Very clearly , <unk> .
And <unk> speed is fast .
So we 're all happy .
But what we found was that the opposite is <unk> than the Grand Canyon , it <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> <unk> .
We think we 're going to do it more <unk> , and we can do this with the <unk> of the Wikipedia market .
Let 's go back to <unk> , looking at how much ice is going to be done , and how fast it is to analyze how much sunlight hits the <unk> of the wing , which is going to get a parachute flew .
And one of my students was working in the lab , working on the community of Haiti , and also the community community , and the same thing that we 're working on , to reform the effort , let 's move all the way , to make sure that everybody 's going to do it all over the place , keeping people all together , refine them all the way down , get people out of the effort , make people work , trying to move all sorts of people who are willing to live , <unk> people .
And after a period of time we invented low - <unk> <unk> , new products , even more than average , even more stable .
So we have a better product right now in the middle of Chicago , which is a good situation .
There is only a couple of people who have been observed every year , and 3,000 million trees are closed .
This product is a product , if you get a large amount of <unk> .
In other words , this new liberal million dollars per year .
This is a high - cost number of people who are 800 million dollars per gallon in Haiti .
So we want to continue on this in Haiti .
And one thing that 's interesting is that I have a friend of mine who 's doing risky research .
He studied what was going to work with health and casualties .
And what he found was that they could have 100 million people in the world , and it was a great thing to do .
But now we can change the agricultural fuel supply .
And the most exciting thing about this is I went to Ghana , and I learned a message about it .
That 's not very cool , but it 's more simple than that , if you can imagine it .
What is this ? This is <unk> <unk> .
And the good thing about this is that you do n't need to get rid of it , because it 's a lot of <unk> , and that 's where I have 10 dollars for the <unk> project .
And I also brought samples for you .
And everyone else .
It 's a good thing to do , and it 's going to take you immediately .
It 's a technique that 's easy to fall through .
And so we 're going to teach people how to reshape the residents , and then there 's a couple of filaments that are made out of <unk> proteins , which are not getting revised .
And this is the most exciting thing I 've ever learned in my lifetime , and also my little <unk> .
But once you 've seen it , as people have seen earlier , right , I think it 's the most non - <unk> of Robert <unk> who says , " <unk> <unk> and <unk> . "
This is not very good for health .
It 's more glamorous , more effective .
They can use <unk> trash .
<unk> .
They got paid for the first time they had to sell their money .
And what 's cool is that it does n't have to do health and economic development , or environmental development .
So the most exciting thing about this project is I expect to see the future of the future .
And I talked about the future , and I think there 's something necessary about this world .
I 'm not saying that we live in this little world .
It 's another world . On there , women get two or three hours to survive family .
In there , it 's called <unk> <unk> , which is the cement where you 're doing 10 dollars a day , even if you do one day .
In there , women and children were doing water , 400 million hours a year .
<unk> is very <unk> of all the workforce , and all of a sudden all the time .
And if this is India , there 's only a third of the people sitting in sitting there .
If it 's a one in Afghanistan , one person knows how to move online .
If you 're Zambia , you have 300 farmers who have HIV / AIDS , and there 's HIV or AIDS .
Half the people in the day are less than one dollar .
These are the questions that we 're all on here .
We need to train engineers , designers , marketing , entrepreneurs .
These are the questions that need to be solved .
Some of the problems , I think , really important .
One of the things that is looking for technology is to try to achieve small groups of financial and legitimacy , and people who live below the poverty line , not like this .
Now we 've already had a new technology that can work with small technologies and new products .
Moreover , we need to develop new technologies for <unk> farmers .
We also need to rethink our development , and we do n't have to do something that does n't make any food , but not a poor farmer .
We have to think about how to cook .
We need to engage with community - sharing resources and tools to tackle their problems . This is the best way to do it .
We ca n't just do it .
We 're going to start to create the future , right now .
Thank you .
<unk> Anderson : So we 'll see whether you 're going to ask the audience to talk about the other things you 've done .
<unk> Smith : Now we 're working on low - cost <unk> , and helping the community to maintain the water , to make sure they know what they 're doing , what they need to do .
We 're also looking for a low - cost <unk> system .
And for example , it 's great for solar - <unk> , but we need to improve productivity .
<unk> : What do you have to do with this technology ?
Does n't you need entrepreneurs , risk capital help or other help ?
Amy Smith : Yeah , that needs a lot of cooperation .
This is hard , because it 's a very strange market , and it does n't do a lot of money .
So the business businesses in America ca n't even develop .
And we did , and I had a <unk> .
So I do n't know what to do .
We have 30 students working on how to use this in this area .
And secondly , these are the ones that are n't going to happen , and this is about five to 10 years .
But I do believe we have confidence .
<unk>
The <unk> surgeon , <unk> <unk> , who does n't have a lot of money to improve their lives , to change their life ; they <unk> their humanity ; he <unk> the human nature , and it 's a <unk> image of the conference -- and that 's why you 're not going to see why this is a bad image , if you 've got to listen to it . If you do n't think about it , the answer is that you ca n't keep it in the screen , but let 's talk about why it
arts , community , culture , design , medical research
<unk>
Yves <unk> : <unk> the face
Our face is very important because it 's the part of the body of human senses .
We remember it 's a function of emotions .
We have solid <unk> for our most important organ : brains .
We 're embedded in the face , some of our special senses -- our vision , our words , we 're our hearing , the smell .
This bone is filled with light , and as you see here , the <unk> lights and the lettuce , <unk> , allowing us to <unk> the air and <unk> the air .
But imagine , if this is the <unk> bone , our speed is very noisy , we can not see the world , and we ca n't see it around us .
This woman is dying because the <unk> of the skull has completely wiped out her mouth and his mouth , so she ca n't breathe and not breathe .
And the <unk> skull used to be able to use the structure of our face , to deliver the muscle that we face in the face of our facial <unk> , where our social signals are <unk> .
What 's called the skin <unk> , which is a very complex three - dimensional structure -- there 's all sorts of things that contain a little bit of <unk> in the area , like the <unk> region and the different colors .
We have <unk> components .
What do we like to take care of ?
<unk> . Maybe maybe in <unk> .
And that 's exactly what we 've drawn in the face .
But we do n't forget the hair .
So you 're looking at this image of your left hand -- this is the picture of my son .
And he did n't look really weird at the <unk> .
This has a profound difference .
And if you look at his nose , he would look a little bit cooler .
<unk> is a fact of the fact that we look at ourselves and see ourselves as different .
This is an amazing fact that we can only see the reflection of our mirror image , and we only look at the picture of the photos we live in .
And the fact that <unk> is an illusion of <unk> behavior that looks like a lot of people who think that self - <unk> , and keep trying to get their <unk> on surgery to make sure that they 're going to work .
They do n't need surgery ; they need psychology .
<unk> his photos to me .
And he did n't have <unk> , but I did it with his photos .
In other words , he looks normal .
The age is another factor to change the change of ourselves .
So kids are self - measurements , learning itself , to measure their behavior .
This is an example of a classic example : <unk> <unk> from her skull , <unk> her nose , and she 's looking at things .
And you can see that the tumor leaves her point .
And if she did her <unk> , her life would be dangerous .
Our research shows that the parents and people who are very obsessed with people like them .
They used to be used for those kids ; they think they 're very special .
In fact , the parents will talk about whether they 're going to get rid of those kids .
And every time , they will <unk> because they 're going to have a big change that will not recognize them .
But the other adults will say something incredibly glamorous .
And they would say , " How do you get the kids out of this baby ?
Do n't you do something ? Why do n't they get rid of that ? "
The other kids will be curious about the song , because a natural curiosity .
This is certainly , of course , to realize that this kid is not glamorous .
And after the surgery , everything came back .
There are more natural activities of this , and these kids are much more elegant .
As a teenager -- think of your teenagers -- and we 've gone through a whole range of times as much as possible .
We 're trying to find our identity .
We want to get the <unk> of the past .
So our faces are really important for us when we 're trying to show ourselves to the world .
Do you remember that a few days can make a difference .
You 're going to spend a long time to look at the mirror , practicing , <unk> , trying to figure out how much more like <unk> <unk> looks like a <unk> . attempts to try to get a eyebrows .
That 's a time to do it .
And I picked up the side of the room , like , because that 's where she can see her <unk> move forward , she 's moving forward .
I 'm going to give you one of these today , and I want you to dwell on your <unk> .
And then you get to the person who 's going to come up with the rest of you , and you 're looking at the people who look at them and look at them -- they look very <unk> .
As everyone told the <unk> .
She did n't have a lot of fun .
But you all ask her , " Why are you so glamorous ? "
And people always make sense of her emotions .
She was being told by teachers and administrators in school , in schools .
So she picked the face surgery .
And after surgery , she said , " Now my face is my personality .
People know that I 'm serious , and I am a happy person . "
teenagers can achieve this change .
What is the change of the real change , or is it just the <unk> of the <unk> ?
We 're looking at the attitudes of teenagers who are on the other side of the <unk> .
We found -- we <unk> these photos together , so they could n't recognize what surgery was surgery after surgery -- and we found these symptoms were thought more attractive .
This is not surprising , but we continue to keep these teenagers , smart , bad , violent , violence .
And before the surgery people have been thought of all of these qualities , not very glamorous , and so on .
And after the surgery , the illness was thought more clever , more honest , even more religious -- but we did n't have the intellectual pain or the personality .
When people age , they do n't have to choose these surgeries .
They were devastated by the end of the <unk> .
And what they 're doing is the destruction of cancer or depression .
This is one of the photos of <unk> <unk> in his face with his left - hand face -- his <unk> , his disciples and <unk> .
And he was n't looking at it .
But the next 15 years , he received 14 surgeries because the disease ruined his face and lost my face towards him .
And I learned a lot about it .
And she told me that I could still work .
His name is <unk> . He 's still traveling .
And he 's happy to enjoy life . And it 's probably because he has a successful job of love , and he can also participate in love .
He was <unk> .
I do n't say he 's fighting tumors ; he does n't .
But importantly , he forgot it .
And he forgot that he was missing his face , and he forget his disease to live .
This is what people do .
Yves Behar describes this phenomenon .
This is a young man who 's young women , and he 's the first time he had his first vote because he needed to get the U.K. surgery .
This is my longest surgery .
23 hours of <unk> , I spoke to my <unk> .
And we took all the bones of his face -- his eyes , nose , skull , <unk> -- using his back to his back .
Yves <unk> continued to work with his depression .
His son , his son was called <unk> .
And he said , " This one I tell my son , I think I 'm a successful man . "
His face had no influence in his face because he had his family support , and he was a successful job of his job .
So we see that we can change these people .
But when we change people , we also change their identity , and that 's good , right ?
For example , two different surgeries .
We can do that .
We can say a patient 's chosen surgery -- as <unk> .
And they feel that they had changed their lives , because others thought they were better people .
They do n't feel differently .
But they think they 've got something that they do n't have , their faces now , they 're <unk> their personality .
This may be the difference between the <unk> and the surgery .
Because you might say , " This surgery can be considered <unk> . "
And if you do that , the patient does n't usually feel like it .
The patients want to change life .
No one wants to change life .
She just wanted her faces to her personality .
There are other people who do n't choose the faces .
These people are <unk> <unk> .
I 'm still going to move the picture to you , and you 're still looking at this blank slide .
But they 're forced to do their faces .
And as I told you , if they had a happy job of their families , they could have a normal and happy life .
Their identity does n't change .
So how do you focus on the <unk> of the industry ?
The experience of <unk> is not like this .
This is a little girl in the <unk> <unk> in London , her face , and she does n't see anything about it , but it 's going to kill her .
After her surgery , her parents dress up to her beautiful green <unk> , and her hair 's blood pressure , she wants to see that the world can see this sign , even though they 're the normal Muslims in their mother .
So this is n't just a Western phenomenon .
We do that in the face of people .
From the way from <unk> and <unk> to his <unk> .
And he said that you can just look at the face of the photo .
<unk> people always assume more .
When we saw <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to spend time with him . He looks pretty upset .
We know that he 's <unk> his wife 's wife , and he does n't have a good job .
<unk> is not equivalent to perfect , much more than <unk> .
We talked about static faces and <unk> responses , and in fact , we 're more accustomed to from movement .
We think we can make assumptions .
The <unk> of England , the legal system , love to see the truth , and they can see whether they 've got truth .
So they want to meet <unk> people .
<unk> tells us that it 's about 10 seconds per second , we can make assumptions .
Do n't we feel uncomfortable with this image ? That 's true .
If our doctors , lawyers , Financial lawyer , are we happy ?
We 're very uncomfortable .
But can we do that very well with facial <unk> and activities ?
The truth is , there 's a five - minute algorithm -- not 10 seconds , but it 's an five minute strategy .
If you 've got five minutes , you start to notice where they 're going to make you feel very boring , and you 're not aware of them , so you do n't have a sense of interest , because there 's no way that you can not notice that they are particularly glamorous because of their personality .
We talked about the faces .
Now I want to share with you some surgeries that we do -- and we 're doing surgery in the future .
This is a picture of the <unk> and her skull and the skull of the skull .
And you can see the picture of the surgery , and we 're very successful at her .
But not good .
I want to go out and get it outside , she wants to go .
And that 's what she did , and this is the direction we need to work .
This is a terrible image , so I put my legs on top .
This is one of the photos of <unk> , a Nigerian bank in Nigeria , and his face is <unk> by <unk> .
He lost his <unk> , his toes , the chin , and the <unk> .
This is his expectations .
" I want to look like this . That 's what I mean . "
Using modern technologies , we use computers .
We did a <unk> model of <unk> .
And then we <unk> a little bag .
And so we can put it in the right place of the appropriate place .
And then we put the bone and the tissues back .
And you can see it <unk> it , and it 's been put in front of the surgery -- and we did this in a surgery .
This patient <unk> normal lives .
That 's the good news .
Even though , his skin skin looks different .
This is his skin .
So the colors , the color , are more crude , and it 's not glamorous .
These are places where we 're flying . We need some <unk> .
A important role in the face is <unk> the skin of the patient 's skin .
We can replace the <unk> on the bottom , but we 're still very ugly .
So in our medical device , these tools are very important .
But people are going to need to have the money to <unk> their immune system .
What does this mean ?
They would be more likely to be infected .
It 's not an saving of life -- like the heart , the liver , liver - <unk> -- this is a huge amount of quality , and it 's a quality of a life that 's going to say , " Well , if they 're in the age of 10 or 15 years , I still do n't know , because I 'm not sure . "
We do n't know what they 're going to feel like .
First attempt to figure out the <unk> of the surgery and <unk> <unk> for them .
<unk> people are not going to have a lot of people , and how many people love to love when she died .
So there 's a lot of problems with faces .
So better news is that the future is going to start -- and this is the <unk> project .
Imagine , I can do a biology <unk> .
I can put it in place .
I can use some of the cells to take some cells from the patient , to some stem cells , and then you can see that four months later , there 's a good job .
This is a little kid who looks like a <unk> kid .
But we have a lot of problems .
We need to solve <unk> .
We do n't have a lot of patients for enough patients -- this is the most serious cancer <unk> .
Our grandparents are n't good enough .
It 's very popular in the face of young people in the U.K.
We ca n't stop <unk> .
We need research .
The best news is that doctors know we need to do research .
We 've been building the help of charity and help that help us experimentally experimentally to achieve the best physical practice and the future , so we ca n't be able to say , " We do n't make it good .
We 're going to tell you that . "
Thank you very much indeed .
<unk>
This is Doug Engelbart 's conference at 2007 , <unk> <unk> , " lunch <unk> . "
children , economics , education , food , global issues , green
<unk>
Ah , <unk> - <unk> .
<unk> , my school , is a great deal for social fair .
I 'm a director of Dr. <unk> Group , <unk> <unk> , in my husband , with 90 employees and 17 children , for <unk> children .
And the average one is going to take a lot of lunch every day , and we 've been doing it for two years . We do what we do to change our kids in our country .
This is what I want to tell you about today .
And now you see the kids in the <unk> .
My dad , in all schools , came out of my school .
At the time , everyone thinks that it does n't work .
Because they think there 's a young child , and the child 's kids are <unk> , but in fact , these two phenomena never appear .
When I look at this project , I try to understand some things , for example , my ideal .
How do we do this with the relationship between <unk> and food ?
And I think it 's not just why we need to change , but we must change .
And I have realized that we have responsibility for our responsibility to <unk> health , healthy food and health care , and the symbiotic relationships between health .
If we do n't do that , the opposite will be , not <unk> , humans will extinction , because our way of raising kids to death .
That 's my premise .
And we see that bodies are much more <unk> .
And the reason for that is that , in fact , our food system is the way we do the same amount of food in food , and governments in the food chain , the <unk> of the government , to <unk> the people who are the ones that are n't healthy , they 're all non - <unk> .
We all have a lot of <unk> and <unk> , clothing , nephew , and tell them what training schools .
And when you give kids a little amount of food , it 's a part of the kids who learn in schools . That 's the key .
And we 're going to come up with a lot of money to get rid of the city .
Anyway , we live in a lot of people who do n't think we 're going to eat what we eat , which produces <unk> spray , like <unk> , and <unk> .
They 've managed to give up to 90 percent of the seeds in the United States .
It 's only a lot of <unk> , and most of the stuff that 's going to be sold in the company , the food , the diet of food , is a problem .
So , when I started thinking about these problems and thinking , how to change the food that kids do , I 'm starting to focus on a problem , and that 's what we need to do .
The first thing we need to do is to get kids to <unk> food , which is trying to eat local food .
<unk> , as much as the fossil fuel consumption of fossil fuels , it 's time to start thinking about the way that we take food from <unk> miles from a hotel .
So , we interact with kids , and we 're starting to get kids to eat local <unk> food .
Now , we 're talking about organic food .
Now , most of the people who do n't have organic food , but we , as a nation , has to start to think of consumption and nurture and produce a lot of chemicals in our <unk> .
We ca n't get kids to stay in <unk> , antibiotics .
We ca n't do it again .
That does n't work .
And the result of the kids is that kids are going to become even worse .
Now , I want to talk about how antibiotics happen .
In the United States , the 70 antibiotics in the U.S.
And kids are embedded in beef every day and other animals .
70 , amazing figures .
The result will cause disease .
We do n't have a problem with bacterial seals , when kids are sick , we ca n't understand it .
<unk> is not just the phenomenon of medicine , but also the problems in food supply .
I can talk about a good example , which is 12 percent of the U.S. agriculture consumption .
That means that each of us and our kids are about five pounds of <unk> , and you have a lot of glasses in our house , so I 'm going to put a bag on the top of the boat and put it in the ground and bring it to the surface of our food , which is that we have the same amount of stuff that binds us to our neighbor 's supply .
The <unk> of our food supply in our diet , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> -- and this ad in the magazine magazine .
All right , we 're going to talk about <unk> <unk> and DDT , and we know , makers are weak .
But this is the substance of <unk> in food supply .
That must change .
We do n't think of what we 're going to do as the <unk> of our children and what things are sending to our children .
We do n't believe that their hearts are the largest benefit for us .
The opposite is sustainable .
That 's what I 'm trying to get people to understand .
I think it 's the most important thing to do with kids -- that 's what 's most important .
And in this dynamic , our Earth does n't die , kids will <unk> , and they can break all the negative effects that we have .
This is completely new .
I mean people always talk about sustainability , but we have to figure out what 's going on .
In less than 200 years of time , it 's about 100 percent of our population , 50 percent reduction , until two percent .
Now we live in a <unk> , much more country than farmers , and tens of thousands of people , 19 million people .
In average , we spent a lot of money in prison for 13 dollars a year , and it costs 500 dollars per year to offer a child .
It does n't matter anything .
And what happened is that our bodies are more expensive .
We 're going to be <unk> with our children .
This is what we do with our kids .
And what we 're going to do is we become a lot of food .
<unk> food and food we have .
If we continue to get rid of this <unk> , if we 're going to do a little amount of food for our kids , when we do n't teach them what to live , what will happen ?
What 's the impact of our entire market ?
And what 's happening is that our next generation of life will be better than us .
And the statistics of the <unk> <unk> account , in 2000 , were born for every three - year - old <unk> , every two , each two of Americans have diabetes .
And if this is true , the <unk> center goes further and further , and diabetes has multiplied before these kids .
That means that 40 or five percent of the <unk> are going to depend on the future for insulin .
What will happen ?
Well , the <unk> center also said that 2,000 year - old kids might become the founder of our national history for their national histories .
That 's all from us to our food .
Because the eight - year - old kids did n't move , if they decided to decide , they would send you a <unk> .
We have responsibility to decide what to do .
But maybe it 's something that has these <unk> .
There 's 200 billion dollars a year to spend the amount of junk food that they eat in the world .
200 billion dollars , allowing the majority of kids to see 10 junk food ads .
They 've got 500 dollars to fight junk food for one dollar per dollar , and the advertising junk is called <unk> , rich food , but in fact , these are the terrible ones that are bad for kids .
And the result is that it 's going to be the <unk> of the kids who have the same food .
You think of kids as much more as more .
This is the <unk> of <unk> , and it 's a very small one .
What 's shown here is the <unk> of McDonald 's and hamburgers , and even the head of the brain is still still big . These people think we should eat so much .
But why are they sharing so much ?
Why can we be able to buy the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 99 in the second half of the year ?
And the reason for that is that the amount of <unk> that governments have done in food , and the cheap corn and legitimacy of our food supply , which is this reason , is that it 's very low , and it 's very costly for the price of these junk food .
So why I call this one thing about social justice .
Now , when I tell you what I 'm doing at Berkeley , you think , " Oh , Doc , that 's a good place , and you can do it . "
Okay , that 's the food I saw in two years ago .
It 's not called food .
And this is what we ate for our kids -- <unk> corn , corn pollution , seals , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> .
These things are made out of plastic glasses , and it 's on the front panel .
The employees had only one plate of <unk> .
The only instruments in the kitchen are a <unk> engine , because they 're not going to come out of the form of <unk> , or they do n't come up with it .
This is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all of these <unk> .
Maybe you ca n't completely tell you , for example , the difference between <unk> and some <unk> .
And <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are the high quality of the fruit spray associated with <unk> <unk> -- common - <unk> <unk> -- a cheap lunch .
This is why governments are asking them to go into their kids .
That does n't work . You know what ? It 's impossible .
We , all of us , have to understand , this is what we can do with us -- we can make it change .
Now , I do n't know if anybody in the audience invented the <unk> , but I could surely say , if you invented a <unk> .
Who decides about the chicken ? <unk> , the giraffe , or <unk> ?
<unk> did that because there was no chicken in the <unk> .
And they would assume that we would sell these things to kids .
In fact , telling the kids what they 're wrong with ?
Most of the schools are bringing these food to kids .
In fact , there 's a lot of parents doing what we 're trying to do .
We do need to change the entire pattern of food and food .
We have to teach kids not a sheep .
The vegetables are glamorous , and it 's also <unk> . It grows in dirt in the dirt .
There are no claws in the world or the panda bear .
We have to change the way we do it .
There 's a lot of things that we can do . There are many schools coming from the farm to school , and lots of schools are really going to go into the campus .
Now in Berkeley , we can say that all of our food is fresh .
We do n't feed the high quality of corn - <unk> corn , <unk> , fat and loss of food .
We do n't have to have a <unk> or seven food every day .
It 's about 25 ... Thank you . We 're 25 percent of the <unk> of local organic .
This is my hand . I 'm four at four a.m.
And for kids to prepare for , because this is my responsibility .
We ca n't continue to go beyond the <unk> of the kids , and the chemicals that are going to depend on our children to become healthy .
You 're not going to depend on your next generation or step next to the next step . I mean , if they continue to eat these junk food .
If they continue to eat these smart chemicals , they would lose thinking .
They 're going to be more stupid .
You know what ? They have a disease .
When I came to Berkeley , I realized that people were very surprised about what we did , and it was a very different way to do it .
And I made these <unk> , and I brought them on the house .
From this calendar , you can understand our whole activity project .
Now I 'm responsible for all of the cooking lessons that we 're going to do in the field .
This is an ongoing pair of <unk> .
It 's a lot of food that goes on .
Can you notice that these are the <unk> ?
And in cooking , I 'm going to teach these food to kids .
At the airport , kids can <unk> all sorts of fresh prostheses .
Children can grow <unk> . Our grandparents provide these fresh food .
If we 're going to change these sorts of things that kids are willing to do with their children , the relationship with <unk> food , what you see in cooking ?
I 've heard a lot about it , and you might know that I did n't make it cold , so they made a fabulous place for me . I do n't understand why you have a <unk> .
From the bottom , I do n't know what you 're going to say . I designed a pyramid .
And you can find it in my website , using English and two languages . It uses vision to tell kids about food .
Yves <unk> 's vegetable paste .
We have to make it change .
We have to get kids to know what food is very important .
We came up with cooking classes in schools , and we launched the <unk> of the curriculum .
And the reason for these things is that we know what we 're seeing in our generation , or <unk> , these kids , all four of these children who are in the car , and the other one is in a car or a <unk> .
What do children learn ? Where do our family go to ?
No <unk> , no communication talk .
So , kids do n't know how to talk to people .
We have to change everything .
That 's my job . These are some of the kids that I 've been working on in my work .
<unk> , the eight - year - old winners of the <unk> diet .
We need to make kids know that Coke and <unk> can not call breakfast .
And we want kids to know that if they 've lost a long - term encounter , they 're going to die like a <unk> <unk> .
There 's a <unk> in our campus .
There 's also a <unk> .
And you know what we 're going to do in our house , and we think it 's important to teach kids to kids .
These are some of the kids who need to understand , and they need a lot of learning .
Because most of us are in our professional career , we have responsibility for the kids , the young and the next generation to save ourselves and save the Earth .
I 've always been involved in public private collaboration .
And I worked with a bunch of personal companies , and they were happy to collaborate with us , but they 'd also love them to expand their businesses to universities .
Most of the schools in most of the schools .
Most of the schools in the United States spent a year in a child , <unk> $ <unk> per year .
She 's five dollars per hour .
Most of you spend 10 dollars per hour , 15 dollars a hour to raise <unk> .
And our education system involves the money in the kids every hour .
If we 're going to change the way we change our kids , we have to do something about it .
We see these public private partners , <unk> organizing , to try and try to change the change .
In our <unk> , our revenues are foundation financed . It 's only about the whole nutritional authorities , and I think that if everybody 's funding <unk> -- it 's going to be <unk> .
We have to change .
We need more funding .
And of course , it 's not only about the food of food , but with the kids .
One of the <unk> tips is to put <unk> on the lunch .
It sounds like an exaggeration .
But you think about it , if you 're ready to take kids to lunch for a lunch , you can see that they 're going to get rid of the cliff , and you 'll see them directly on the top of the cliff .
And so they 're a little <unk> , and they 've got <unk> .
And because kids do n't eat lunch , when you get kids , you see them <unk> .
So the only thing for lunch to lunch is that the kids do the homework , which is the lecture , and the children will sit down and eat their lunch .
We have to have education .
We have to do education for kids .
We have to educate education .
There are nine employees in my <unk> .
There are two Adam who should do cook , but not yet .
You know , our money is not glamorous .
But it ca n't stop it .
We have to get rid of the way that they 're cooking , because they do n't want to do something like this , which is because in schools and other educational institutions .
We need to get 40 minutes of <unk> , which is only 20 minutes per school , and we still need to choose the appropriate ones .
One of the most important research is that most schools choose to lunch in the morning two days .
This is not <unk> .
You know , everything we 're doing is ridiculous .
We should remember that , at least in our hearts , this is what we teach them to do .
And if we want to change , one of the things we 're going to do is change the way that we 're going to take the national route of the country .
Not for the rest of the country at the negotiating table , and I think it 's going to be a reduction in waterborne disease , and I think it should be <unk> by the epidemic .
If we think about what food is to think of diet and our children , if we come from the health of health , we 're not going to hit the food of food , and then our lunch dough does n't fall like this .
<unk> <unk> talked about this or so , and then I want to end with some <unk> numbers , because I think there 's a way to make you understand this .
<unk> programs are spending every year for 80 billion dollars per year .
This is a number of times .
People would say , " Oh , my God , where are we going to make the 80 billion ? "
In our country , we spent billions of dollars per year in the country .
It 's a hundred billion dollars per year in <unk> .
We 're in the vegetable ice , but only 500 billion dollars , which is why we need so much <unk> .
We 've been consumed by a billion dollars per year in terms of treating obesity .
2,000 billion dollars .
You can understand that , as we say about 80 billion dollars , it 's not a big number .
80 billion dollars ended up on two dollars per year , and this is the cost of government to fight in the <unk> .
Most of the people who spend those two thirds are spending on vacation and <unk> .
This is what it means that we 're going to pay for a dollar - to - a - half dollar bill , which is 80 to 90 stars per day , and in Los Angeles , this number is 56 stars .
This is the cost of a $ cost in lunch .
I do n't know what your consumption drive is , but I 'm going to go in San Francisco to Starbucks , and in the San Lama , in <unk> , there 's a restaurant , or a big amount of <unk> .
The price of a cup of coffee would be more expensive . In our schools , average week , we spent lunch on the amount of money we spend on kids .
You know what it is .
We , as a nation , should be <unk> .
This is the most glamorous country in the world .
In our country , the best for the health , and they 're eating junk food .
These are the kids who are illiterate , <unk> , uncles and uncles , and they do n't even want to provide the junk that they have for school to travel .
And these kids , their bodies are more expensive .
Or these kids , they need our care .
We can do something .
Every single one of us can , regardless of ourselves , whether we do n't have kids , whatever we like , or give us a <unk> or a nephew , we can do a force .
Whenever you sit down to your children , you 're going to take your kids , or your family , your <unk> , the <unk> to farmers , to <unk> the food of food .
Just sit down and sit and get the <unk> <unk> .
From the macro - ray , we 're in a age of 19 months of Japanese elections , and when we ask the presidential candidates , let 's talk about a child health . Thank you .
Thank you .

The path , especially in the middle of the town , is almost a <unk> reality for all the major areas , and the film is <unk> for us how to travel a few of these consumers who have been able to get rid of the past .
cars , transportation .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : How to solve the <unk>
Hey , I 'm here to talk about <unk> .
The roads are all over .
Almost almost every city in the world , and it 's a strange thing .
I mean , think about a lot of differences in every city .
I mean , that 's the typical state of Europe , which is very broad , and most of the <unk> systems are very good , but it 's not really bad .
On the other hand , there 's the <unk> .
It 's basically <unk> , right .
Anyway , in the <unk> city , <unk> handling systems are almost almost impossible .
There 's also the city of the emerging world , and there 's no difference between transportation , which is rich and plentiful , but usually the density of density .
There 's been a lot of different ways of traveling around the world : <unk> Cities or in cities , and large roads , or large amounts of <unk> or a large amount of information , there are lots of other things , but there 's nothing wrong .
But there 's a whole thing about it .
And that 's basically what they 're trying to try to figure out what people are doing .
And they 're trying to figure out what to do to others , to plan for them .
Now , a complex social system is a very difficult thing , and I 'm going to tell you a story .
In <unk> , when <unk> strikes , a city in London came up with one person in the city , and the idea of <unk> is " Hello , " and I 'm <unk> .
The <unk> in London said , " What would you say ? ' ' Who 's responsible for London .
" Oh , but there 's somebody else who 's going to die .
I mean , this is a very complex system . Somebody 's going to get paid . "
" No , no . No .
I mean , basically , I never thought about this problem .
It 's basically chaotic . "
<unk> organized .
This is the complex example of the complexity of self - organization . And this is phenomenal .
And when you want to solve real social problems , most of the time , the right approach is to create <unk> .
You do n't need to design small , and people know how to adapt new structures .
Now we 're going to see how this <unk> can help us solve the problem .
This is the map of my hometown , Stockholm .
Now tonight is a medium - scale city , which is about two million people , and at the same time , there 's also a city of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> cities , all sorts of open - ups , historically , in the road .
The red here shows the most <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , which is the direction of <unk> .
So someone came up with this idea , not bad , did n't spend the cost of money , but trying to try to manage the driver 's license .
Now the <unk> are just a <unk> , and I mean , I 'm going to spend a little bit more than a parking amount , so you do n't think about it .
You 're wrong .
It 's just <unk> for 20 percent of the cars to avoid the 65 percent .
You might say 20 percent of the time , although it 's a good figures , but there 's the other 80 percent , right ?
Because there are 80 percent of the cars that are in the <unk> .
And you 're wrong , because the <unk> <unk> , which means that when the transportation is increased , it starts <unk> and rapid fast .
But luckily , the addition is also the creation .
As long as it is , it 's a little bit more <unk> than the speed of <unk> .
And at the end of the day in 2005 , the first picture of <unk> came from <unk> , which was the one that was taken in the streets of a two - year - old corner .
And that 's what <unk> did , and the photos of the <unk> was this .
When you get 20 percent of the cars on the street , it looks like this .
<unk> did a lot of <unk> .
As I mentioned , the driver can adapt , right ?
And after a while , they 'll come back to the airport because they 're used for pricing .
It 's <unk> , and today , in Stockholm , there are six and a half years old , which is basically the same amount of size .
But you see , there 's a funny portrait in 2007 .
And the thing about this is that the <unk> , the beginning of the project , is starting to get the nature of nature , and the next month starts to dominate the bottom , which is a very clever opportunity in 2007 .
I mean , this is an interesting experiment , and we have the opportunity to do twice .
For me , I do n't have two years to make a two - year - old , but it 's going to make them a lot of time .
Anyway , this is very interesting .
So we did the track . What happened ?
This is the last day of <unk> <unk> , seven months before you saw the same street , but it 's a very nice street in summer , and the first year in the summer it looks like this .
All the cars came back , and they had to get rid of these driver .
The first one was coming back .
This is happening . So it 's in 2007 .
And those <unk> are really excited about this , and it 's also surprising , but I 'm going to say , well , that 's the most surprising image I 'll show you , but this one .
It shows the service of the public and the support for the <unk> in Stockholm , and when this fee comes in in 2006 , you 're strong against it .
70 percent of people are averse to fight .
But it did n't have to be more <unk> when they did n't think so much like it was expected .
Instead , their ideas come from a certain point from the experience , now 70 percent of the people who are going to continue to fight , which means , let 's repeat the same amount of population in the past .
So , how could this be ? Why ?
Think , who changed ?
I mean , 20 percent of the driver 's license are not <unk> .
Where do they go ? Well , if we can understand this , that 's probably why people are optimistic .
So we did this big leopard service for all sorts of transportation services , trying to understand who changed ?
And they did n't know .
You do n't know why . The driver 's confidence to say that they 're actually driving .
Why ? Because the pattern patterns are n't like you think of <unk> .
People are going to make new decisions every day , and people and they are changing the world 's world , which is the same thing that they 're struggling with .
Even they are .
Another problem is , who change their ideas ?
Who makes them change , and why change ?
So we did another research , trying to understand why people change ideas , where people changed ?
<unk> is more than half the people who think their ideas are not changing .
They 're all saying that they 're going to be paid to handouts .
So what 's really happening now is that we 're going to reduce the <unk> of 20 percent , so that it 's so costly that you reduce their behavior , and they do n't have a change in their own behavior .
This is the little driver of a little bit of social social problems , and when you use it , you should n't tell people how to adapt .
It does n't work in the right direction .
If you do that , people will accept this change , if you 've done it even .
Thank you .

And <unk> <unk> gave us the case of the <unk> of Afghanistan -- the family of peace in Afghanistan , <unk> , volunteers , and people , in the newspapers , the world .
arts , design , global issues , journalism , photography , storytelling

<unk> <unk> : A <unk> in Afghanistan
A few years ago , I started in Afghanistan in my Afghanistan -- the eastern East border border .
I had the story of the <unk> in the grandmother .
There 's a lot of people who are in the middle of the campus , and there are thousands of people who are killed or <unk> .
And in the midst of the chaos , I found this soul here .
I meet people who have a compromise .
They 're listening to their food .
I 've been doing this for 20 years since Eastern Europe -- across the East coast -- spread across the coast of the Middle East .
We meet more creativity .
They 're listening to their food and also sharing their food .
That 's why I went to Afghanistan .
One day , I walked out of the <unk> room .
<unk> <unk> on <unk>
In Afghanistan , the leopard soldiers saw me very surprised , and I forget my failures .
But he gave me a glass sandwich .
And I learned that he was surprising .
And I was traveling on the <unk> of the road , and the leopard <unk> , my <unk> trucks , went down from Iran to the Iranians .
I found that bright light , and I found <unk> in Afghanistan .
My only weapon is my laptop and <unk> .
I 've heard the prayers of the <unk> of <unk> -- the Muslims that <unk> the Taliban .
And this polar bear is connected to the mystery of <unk> until India .
In the <unk> of globalization , <unk> faced and <unk> refuse to be welcome to welcome <unk> .
In this country , we do n't think about how many people in the country are trying to get rid of those <unk> villages , and we know how much to do it .
These are people who are at the top of the city , in the <unk> of Afghanistan , at the beginning of Afghanistan .
They were <unk> girls who became the shaman of Afghanistan .
After 10 years , what do we learn about the women ?
They 're wearing name by the <unk> of China .
And one day I saw the largest school in Afghanistan , a woman school school .
<unk> , girls are learning rooms in the basement .
And they 've got a lot of love about learning .
Now , what do we know about the people who are sent to the schools in the middle of the school , and how many people are going to know about the Taliban ?
And this area is very dangerous , and it 's all about the Taliban who have the dangers of the Taliban .
My goal is to use these crazy people to make the sound of the <unk> <unk> , which is a big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> the world 's first forgotten world .
Thank you .

When the leopard <unk> understood that he had a very rare observation , he was in the Internet with a group of patients , and found a lot of doctors who did n't hear his own doctors . And he said that all of his patients were connected to each other , to understand the health of the patient , knowing the growth of health .
collaboration , culture , data , health care , science , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : Forget a license .
And we 're going to have an amazing thing about the development of patients .
And today , you 've heard a little bit about the patient that will say , " You know what , although I know the opportunity is not big , but I 'll find more information .
And I want to define what I do .
I 'm going to share with you how I almost die from four years ago , in fact , when I was born almost almost dead .
And then I came up with what 's called the search for the patient -- and I 'll explain what it means .
I used to write the name of the patient 's name , but I had my name since I discovered it , and I grew up calling myself .
And when I started working on this word for a few years ago , I 've seen a lot of meetings at the same time , and I noticed that they talk about the patient as a person who was talking about whether they 're going to do n't have one person .
Some of the statements today are still there .
But I 'm here to tell you , the patient is never a glamorous word .
You 've got to feel a day of a hospital in the hospital -- or your mother , your kids -- I see a lot of people who are collapsing , and they say , " I do n't know what you mean . "
So , when you hear what I 'm going to tell you today , first , I want to say that I 've met all the patients and all those patients who have never met me before .
We 're going to make the disease a little more active , a more positive place to help health care .
One of my hospitals in the hospital , Charlie <unk> and his colleagues <unk> <unk> , who has been involved in this kind of idea : the most unhealthy <unk> in health care -- is the patient .
They started calling this idea from 1970 .
Now I 'm going to go back .
In the seventh of ' 60s .
I was a college freshmen , and we went to the moon for the first time .
This is the world that we 've seen from the beginning of the Earth , looking at this world , and you 're living on this world .
The world is changing .
And no one can expect to change .
This is a couple of weeks after the moon , after a few weeks , in the atmosphere .
Three - thirds of music and <unk> .
In history , here 's a picture I 'm sitting on .
Yeah , <unk> hair , white eyes , not normal .
And jumping in 1971 , " <unk> <unk> . "
This is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We think they 're just <unk> , but one of the important components of that is that I 've been involved in that campaign , which is a very important relationship for yourself .
This <unk> is called " <unk> tools . "
It talked about how to build your house , how you grow your food , everything like this .
In 1980 , one of the doctors in the ' 80s is called " <unk> <unk> , " which is a medical editor .
And what he found was that most of the things we did in medicine and health care .
In fact , he says that 70 percent are about 80 to 80 percent of our body .
And he also found that when it 's more disease , it goes from the health of health to health , and the main thing is that the main <unk> of the health is the <unk> of information .
When the Internet came up , everything changed . Not only because we found information , but we could find the same thing as others , information .
He 's invented -- the patient 's word " patient . " It 's a good thing to do .
And obviously in the span of life , he looks more <unk> than ever .
Now I 'm a <unk> patient in my voice .
In 2006 , I went to my doctor 's doctor , and I told him , my shoulder M .
And he gave me X a.m. next morning , and you might notice that you 've got health crisis .
And today , some of the speakers are going to tell you a little bit about the date of the disease .
For me , I was in one seventh of the year in 2007 .
I was in offices , and I sat in my offices ; the blue line was on the wall .
That 's it , and it 's my doctor .
And he said , " <unk> , I 've found a <unk> in my house .
And he said , " Your shoulders is n't okay . But you 've got some of your lungs .
If you look at the red <unk> , the shadow should be in that place .
For a long story , I asked him , you need me to go back and test it ?
He said , " Yes , we 're going to have a CT scan . "
And then I asked him , do I do something ?
He said -- think about it .
You 're going to give you the advice to you when you get to your wife .
I went to do a CT scan . I 've got five <unk> .
And that 's why we have cancer .
We know this is not cancer .
That means that other cancers move into the lungs .
The question is , what 's the cancer ?
I did an ultrasound .
Like a lot of <unk> women , <unk> in the stomach , and then <unk> it .
My wife <unk> me .
She 's a vet , so she watched a lot of <unk> .
I think she 's not a dog .
But we see that this is <unk> images .
It 's much better than corruption .
We saw a big <unk> in <unk> .
It 's actually two .
One long time is in the front of the day . It 's <unk> on the <unk> .
And there 's a long period of time in the process , and it 's in a piece of <unk> -- this is a little muscle muscle from the back , but suddenly I started concerned about it .
I went back home .
Now I 've been using Google to Google , in <unk> .
I go back to home , and I know you ca n't know this . But it 's not important .
And what I want to say is that I went to a <unk> medical website , <unk> , because I know how to dry garbage .
I found my wife in the Internet .
I 've been doing something that was n't appropriate for me before .
So I try to figure out what 's going on .
This is something that 's very relevant to trust , what is the information that we can trust ?
What is my body ? Where do you start to drive ?
Cancer , a tumor , comes out from your own body tissue .
How does this happen ?
What 's going to happen ?
So I had a very low incidence in the <unk> , and I was very low .
Almost all the patients are <unk> .
And in the course of a few years of experience , I know that if I do n't like the first results I have to get more .
I 'm on other sites , even on Google search to Google , and it 's not very significant .
And I said , this is how it is .
I do n't feel so comfortable .
I would feel tired when I was at grade school , but I was born .
I 've got less weight in my weight , but for me , it 's a doctor telling me what to do .
I do n't know what it is .
This is a picture of a <unk> medical picture from the end of my end .
And I had the same thing about my lungs .
On the left side , there 's another one on the left .
I have one . I lost my legs last .
And I went down , and I was on my leg .
There 's a piece in the skull to describe it , and I have these other tumors that include , in my beginning , my tongue 's <unk> .
My lung rises to my tongue .
I learned that the average <unk> was 24 weeks .
That 's really bad .
And I had a leg across the campus .
And I thought , what do my mother look like in my funeral ?
I have to sit down my daughter and tell me what it is .
And she 's here .
I said , I do n't want you to get married because you want to be alive in dad .
It 's really a big deal .
Because if you want to know why disease people are forced to want each other , think about it .
And my doctor told me a patient community community , <unk> , a network of cancer , all sorts of magical things .
And soon they tell me that malaria is a normal disease .
Find a <unk> center .
There is no cure , but when you 're a therapeutic <unk> , it 's usually not the same way that it is called <unk> <unk> .
Most hospitals do n't offer this cure . So they did n't tell it .
Do n't let them tell you something else .
Well , in the middle of your country , four doctors give this therapy , their number is .
How beautiful ?
Now this is the case .
We 're here , four years later , you ca n't tell you that information .
Government <unk> , the U.S. Cancer Association , but the patient knows what to know .
That 's the power of the patient .
And the magic object , I mentioned , where 's my body ?
My tumor doctors and I used to be in this period , because I tried to make it precise .
And he said , you know , the immune is very good on the Earth , and bacteria comes from the outside , but the <unk> is completely different .
I 've had a spiritual exercise , because I started a community community on a website , and one of my friends , my colleague , is actually , say , look at this stuff ?
Do you want to fight yourself with yourself ?
So we started beginning .
There 's a story about how stories happen .
Anyway , this is how these numbers get found .
I said , I 'm going to do it for the number of figures that I have about the size of my tumor in my hospital .
Do n't wait .
And you see , this is the immune system .
And this amazing two - <unk> <unk> is the place where I give two <unk> , two months later .
If you look at the size of the tumor , how fast it is .
It 's just unbelievable .
Who can think about what we can do , when we learn something about it .
The point is , a year and a half later , in this beautiful young woman , my daughter , married , I came up on the stage .
And when she comes down , it looks like I 've got her and her . I 'm happy she does n't have to tell her that my dad is here .
That 's what we 're doing , right ?
Now , I want to talk about a couple of other patients , and all of the forces of all the forces that are going to improve health care .
This is <unk> <unk> , a painter in Washington , whose husband died in medical , and I have to do a year later .
She 's painting up here , and she draws her husband in the hospital several weeks .
And one of the things she found was that her husband 's medical record was labeled in this <unk> .
She thought , if I could find a nutritional tag on the couch , why do n't you have a simple way to tell each elder nurse , every single doctor , and every one of my husband is based on a new situation .
And she took care of the health , and she added a stable tag , like this . In his chart .
She did this last year .
She 's like my father 's career .
She realized there was a lot of people , and they wrote a book about the patient 's rights book , but you ca n't hear these books .
The patients did n't have <unk> resources .
As I started telling you , I do n't know the power of the patient 's rights to a patient .
I actually talked about a couple of years ago in a conference , for me , because you ca n't be trusted .
She 's listening to her data . There is a <unk> . It starts <unk> , and the water is symbolic .
In fact , I want to give you some kind of <unk> .
In Twitter , I knew a person who was working in the Boston <unk> <unk> , and he wrote a <unk> .
It 's like this .
♫ Give me a damn data , ♫ ♫ I want to become an invitation -- it 's like a patient who is like <unk> , because I have to do it for me .
Thank you for a time .
Think about the probability , why the iPhone and the advertisers are evolving very much faster than those people you can make care for your families .
There 's a website , and it 's <unk> , I 'm just going to jump .
And I said , what do I want to know ?
You can click on different sections and move it .
And I found that , <unk> , this is the kidney , and this is <unk> .
I 'm going to rotate in three modes , and I 've learned it now .
This makes me think about Google Earth , and you can fly into anything .
And I thought , why do n't you <unk> this data with my digital scan , for my body ?
What about the Google left ?
This is now Google <unk> .
But you can see , it 's still <unk> .
Not my own data .
But if you can <unk> the data back behind the world , software is <unk> in these data , like the Human <unk> , who knows what to do .
The last story : This is <unk> <unk> , a <unk> patient . She comes from Florida .
This is a story that 's happening in the last few weeks .
<unk> , they call her their blog <unk> -- a big problem , because they do n't see the symptoms .
And this is really hard to understand the diseases .
Some doctors will think , yeah , you 're really authentic .
But she found out it through the Internet , and she scans it normally , often in cancer , but it could also also be found .
She found that if you did n't have any <unk> , it was the same thing .
So she did a scans .
The reports of <unk> <unk> said no .
That 's not what he normally does .
And she told him to read it again . She 's going to tell you about it .
She finds a CD .
He said , if you do n't want to obey my guide .
So she found the CD - <unk> video , looking at all the important <unk> .
Now she 's focused on her blog to help get better therapies .
And you see , this is the patient 's patient , without any <unk> training .
We are , in fact , the most unhealthy than the medical profession .
She can do this because she can get the original data .
What 's the big problem ?
Tim Berners - Lee , the invention of the Internet , did a report , and he said that the next important development is n't using your browser , but it 's really raw data .
And in the end of the report , he <unk> all the audience to the end .
This is now the raw data .
I ask you , please join me with three words , to improve health care .
<unk> patients .
<unk> patients .
<unk> patients .
Thank you .
And for all around the world , people are going to do this with you : <unk> <unk> : Every single one of you .
<unk> : There you are . Thank you very much .

Now , there are over 10 million people in the world , and how do we help them have a bold and empowering plan for <unk> .
Africa , activism , business , development , economics , global issues , politics , poverty
280
Paul MacCready : That 's 10 million people .
Now , are we doing that ?
The <unk> , " 10 billion people , have asked now about 10 million people in the world , and they are still four years old , so they 're going to escape our world .
So the question that should be really asked is : Can we use <unk> ?
<unk> : How do we empower the <unk> of the individual ?
This is a major <unk> for me , which is the main part of the developing world .
I 'm going to teach you now to a leopard , and this is the combination of two positive power of <unk> , which are the <unk> of compassion .
<unk> soul , that 's because there 's still about 10 billion people in the world , right ?
That 's the end of the human race .
<unk> <unk> , if the economy does n't continue to continue with the other , it 's going to be the next 10 years of <unk> to the global society .
We need to worry about <unk> ; we need <unk> <unk> .
This empire will change the world .
So , what does it mean for a billion people ?
What do we actually do ?
So this is a good beginning , what did we do in the last time ? How did the world work ?
This is a good clue , of course , and you 're going to go back to a long time to find this quote .
This is happening in the ' 60s , the <unk> of the world , evolving another area .
And that <unk> world is that you , in the United States , need to develop the area where we , Europe .
That 's Europe , Europe .
So , why do America get better ?
It 's not just about compassion , but it 's true .
Because you know you have to do this , in the late ' 80s , for 40 years , so you can only do that .
Europe provides an economic recession .
So what do you do ?
Yeah , you 've got a big aid plan . Thank you very much .
That 's <unk> aid ; we need to do it again again . Help it .
Now , what do you do ?
You 're completely blind from the trade of the <unk> policy , and the new one is completely irrelevant .
World War II , the United States was highly active <unk> .
And then , after the World War II , you 're going to open markets to Europe , and you 've got Europe over the world to the global economy , which is where you are .
This is the trade - driven policy .
Do you have other things ?
There you go . You 're totally <unk> .
In World War II , your safety policy is <unk> .
And then , after the World War II , you 're going to get 10 years later in the corner of Europe , and you 've got 10 .
Have you <unk> safety <unk> ?
There you go . You 're killing a <unk> .
And the World War II , you think that <unk> is so sacred , so you do n't want to get a <unk> .
And then , after the World War II , you 're building the U.N. and <unk> and the <unk> , and you do n't want to build <unk> in Europe . All of the systems are supporting services for each other , to support the other .
These are still useful : aid , trade , security , government .
And of course , the detail is going to change , because these are all required .
And these are n't <unk> to <unk> Europe , but it 's going to make the same 10 billion people in the world that will be <unk> .
This will be easier or harder ?
We need to have <unk> and attitude .
And today , I 'm going to <unk> .
I 'm going to hear a little bit more powerful , which is the mother and the <unk> , the government , and I 'll show you a new idea of how to expand the authority of the state , that the world is critical .
There 's a chance to get us out of the way that we 've got 10 billion people in the world , and this is <unk> .
The <unk> of the commodity is going to go into a lot of money , but it 's not all , they 're all over the place .
They put money in these countries because the price of goods is very high , but it 's not glamorous . In those countries they found a series of resources .
And Uganda had been discovered by the oil oil , and that 's the most devastating place on Earth ; Ghana is found that oil has been found independently independently .
So , a series of <unk> .
And these new <unk> make money to remember .
Just give you an example : <unk> per year from fossil oil .
Over the first 10 billion people in the last year , the amount of money for the poorest countries , in six billion countries , in <unk> billion countries .
So the <unk> of the commodity will provide the world 10 billion people .
So it 's a lot of that .
But the question is , how do we help them develop ?
This is a huge opportunity for development .
Will it be <unk> ?
And so I did a little research on this question , and this is what happened to me when I finished .
And I went to look at a lot of <unk> <unk> , and I grew up with the relationship between the commodity .
I 'm going to look at the world of globalization , and I 'll begin to show you all across the global country , from 40 years ago , looking at this relationship .
From short to watching -- it 's about seven years of <unk> -- their relationship is good .
It 's a great thing to say : All the stuff goes up .
Because the increase in trade , the profits that you 're making , but it 's also going to fall into all of you .
So GDP continues -- good ! But it 's a short story .
How long from a long perspective ?
Let 's see about 15 years later .
From a short look , it 's <unk> ; it is a long time to see it from a long period of time .
Now , you can reduce the short short , but most social , historically , from the history of history , almost <unk> back .
This is not the projection of growth ; it 's about the airbag projection for the progress of a long - term trend .
So what is wrong ? Why is it ?
And so I studied it again , and it turns out that the key question is that it 's going to depend on resource development , which is the capacity for social control .
In fact , if your government has enough effects , it 's not going to happen .
That 's the long term .
That 's Norway , Europe . Europe , which is Australia , Canada .
The production of resources is completely powerful in the state of these countries .
But most of them are in the middle of 10 billion countries .
They 're all done with <unk> .
They are growing faster now .
And that 's just the question that they 're going to stay there .
And in history , their government was equivalent to 40 years ago .
Like Nigeria , if they did n't kill oil , their situation would be better .
So for those countries , in a long - term fashion , it 's a very short existence of <unk> .
This <unk> , for example , is the head of <unk> in the ' 80s .
So the question is , what are these countries in the country , and they do n't have access to that <unk> ?
And since the <unk> , the idea of democracy has remained growing in the ' 80s .
So I think that 's exactly what makes the state of government change .
Maybe it 's because of the <unk> of democracy , we can be optimistic .
The idea of democracy is obviously clear -- but it 's not glamorous .
The trouble for democracy is more trouble than the Grand Canyon .
In this phase , I 've been singing research on research , but it turns out that the result of democracy is not beyond it .
Because there are two different kinds of democracy . The Japanese practices , decided you 're going to fix you ; you decide how to do it .
And the fact that the <unk> of the negative democracy is an election , and the strong seasons are <unk> the side of the commodity .
So what the countries need to do is a strong balance .
But they did n't have those things yet .
They 've got democracy in the ' 90s , without any flaws .
How do we help them increase the authority of the government , and what do we do ?
And for all the ones in the middle of the world , they 're all going to be able to save milk from <unk> .
We should be building a bunch of <unk> , and we need to be able to do that , but also to deliver control of these resources .
We know that these <unk> are effective , and we 've built one .
That 's " <unk> <unk> . "
And the content of this conference is very simple , and it 's required to deliver government to their public services .
But this foundation was proposed by the winner of Nigeria , and it came to the press and published their revenues .
These are the papers coming down .
People want to know about the revenues of their government .
So we know that this is very effective , but what 's the origin of these international rules ?
I do n't have time to do it . I 'm going to give you an example .
And the first thing is , how to get resources to -- this is a economic process , turning resources into a property .
So the first step is to sell resources of resources .
You all know that resources are sold , but from the last 40 years , how how do they sell ?
A company is a company , and it 's a <unk> .
This company and this minister is won -- but usually the <unk> of the country .
There 's a very simple <unk> that 's called <unk> , which can change this situation .
With all of the public institutions on Earth , the biggest majority of <unk> , of course , is the Navy -- the British Navy .
In the U.K. , the <unk> decided to deliver some power to the cell phone , and they need to calculate these values .
They 're just going to be a <unk> for 20 years .
At the same time , a group of economists suggested , " Why do n't you draw a piece of paper ? This will show [ the ] values of the [ [ ] " ] [ " That 's <unk> . "
And the <unk> result is 200 .
If it 's possible to achieve 10 billion dollars across the Navy , think about what <unk> does .
When I was going to launch this proposition to the president , the next day this president was like the World Wide Web , <unk> a group of experts in the World Wide Web , trying to help them .
There are five key stages of <unk> ; every step is used in <unk> .
If we can do that , we change the world .
We can help them to change their social change .
That 's our job . We ca n't change those societies , but we can help change social , because they 're normally struggling to struggle , and it 's because of infections <unk> .
Now , we 're not building those rules .
If you think about this , the International <unk> spends these international rules is zero -- less cost .
But why do n't they ?
And I realized that the cause of the question is that politicians are always trying to do something , unless our countries have a group of finance .
unless we have a social society , politicians are just a little bit of a punishment on Africa : <unk> , <unk> .
And I realized that we need to create a social society .
This is the rules that I 've been striving for for economists to read an economist in the beach .
But , I have to say that communication is not that easy .
And that 's why I 'm standing on this stage , but it 's <unk> .
I 'm growing a <unk> <unk> .
And my wife is showing me a blog about the blog interview , which says , " <unk> is n't glamorous -- but his reputation <unk> <unk> . "
Suppose you agree with this idea , and you say we need a <unk> society and a group of accidents , you realize I need you .
Please be [ unclear ] .
Thank you .

Stephen <unk> : A <unk> for surgery
And I 'd like to talk about you tonight tonight .
The first thing is that surgery and surgery are really hard for surgery .
The second language , in this world , is <unk> us with each other .
And then , in my face , these are very good , and I 'll tell you about my reason tonight .
Now no one wants to get surgery .
Anybody have a surgery in the audience ?
Do you want to accept surgery ?
Keep your hands up , please .
Nobody wants .
In particular , no one wants to have a huge amount of pain , a lot of <unk> of the tools , and it 's going to leave you with huge <unk> surgery .
But if you have to accept surgery , you want a surgery surgery .
And this is what I 'm going to show you tonight : self - <unk> , and teach people to look at a good , broad <unk> .
Okay , just to tell you , cutting surgery is hard to get to sleep , and then <unk> it to the <unk> of the sun , put it into the noise of <unk> , to <unk> the air , putting it in a very dangerous way .
That 's actually true .
This is an <unk> surgery .
We have a million slides a year in the U.S.
This is <unk> , a little blood vessel .
You see , the surgery is very focused on the <unk> .
They look at their faces .
And this surgery is very <unk> , and it 's very glamorous .
We 've done about 20 million years in the U.S.
Well , when you 've heard about this , " he 's born a checklist . "
To me , the surgery is not born .
It does n't work .
We do n't find a vessel who can produce them .
The surgery went out of the way .
First of all , from the most fundamental skill .
And then I 'm going to show you , hopefully , put them into the operating room , and they learn how to do it .
And then they trained them .
It 's about five years to <unk> .
If you have to accept surgery , the <unk> are your <unk> .
Okay , get out of <unk> .
Finally , enough luck , it becomes a <unk> level .
This is one of the major challenges , and some of us have come from the largest surgery <unk> in the United States , <unk> , in ' 90s , building the surgeon , making sure that every time to diagnose the surgery and make them good knowledge and skills .
And this is the <unk> of the United States , which is a little bit of a interested in the American budget , and it 's a bit of a dedication for each of these <unk> surgery .
This is not just a lecture , but it 's not only about the classes ; they 're also going to add high pressure .
Very difficult .
And just last year , one of our partnerships with partners : the American surgery of the United States , the <unk> of all the surgeries that we 've been collaborating with .
Is it the surgery of the United States and Canada ?
No , no .
So , for this global education and training , it 's a very big task , I 'm excited , because we travel around the world .
And the surgery in the world is <unk> in the world .
So now there 's a problem .
We ca n't wait every corner .
We have to bring the world smaller .
Maybe some tools are able to solve this problem .
One of my personal tools is a very , very short tool .
This is my friend inspired me .
His name is <unk> <unk> , and he comes from Toronto .
And he proved to be able to teach people to <unk> .
This is an entrepreneur that 's teaching a living person in Africa , and it 's going to be the <unk> of the English , which is trying to capture surgery .
Very hierarchical .
But we have a problem for this .
Even though people talk about English , they 're <unk> people .
Because for them , this is n't a surgery , but it 's a <unk> .
I 'm a little bit more specific .
I work in Cambridge .
This is the primary buyer of Harvard Medical School .
We have more than <unk> <unk> , and we know more about <unk> languages in this little hospital .
It 's a <unk> job .
Imagine the price of the runaway in the world , and your patient communication is not teaching the surgery , but only with your patients , we 're going to have a lot of energy .
We have to use technology to help us .
In the hospital , we saw the professors of Harvard who saw it recently .
You ca n't imagine how hard it is to take care of you .
And you do n't always get permission .
So we need tools .
We need a universal <unk> .
And after this lecture , I hope you could n't think of this session as a <unk> and <unk> .
Think of it as a dialogue .
It 's a lot of things we learn to learn .
In other parts of the world , the average amount of money in our country has been much more money , but it 's a lot of money .
Maybe we 're going to learn things .
So , I 've got a passion for my passion in the world of training .
Last year , I went to the Latin America , and in China , the Chinese Museum of <unk> <unk> .
And the same thing that I 've ever met everywhere , " We need these , but we want to use our language . "
So we want to do this : imagine I 'm doing a lecture and you can use the language of the audience to communicate .
I hope that the same thing from Asia , Kenya , Africa , people in Europe , are very , very low - tech technologies , and they 're interacting with a cost of price .
They 're using communication .
They can also teach us some things .
This is the <unk> .
So , we try to find a broad <unk> ; I think it will appear .
Your website can translate , and your mobile phone is <unk> , but it does n't have to be a lot of instruction .
Because we need a <unk> . What is <unk> ?
It 's a <unk> system .
And I need a health care system .
This , I need a surgery .
It 's a big undertaking . We have to do it .
So let me tell you what we 're doing .
This is research -- <unk> .
We 're working with groups of federal partners and support centers for a broad <unk> .
And it 's building a doctor in a framework - based system that shows you a little bit of a lecture - on - a - skill framework , and it uses a lot of technology to use other technologies .
But we do n't have special texts , so third technology came out .
And then we 've got the key to the answer , and we combine the key to translation .
We put the text into a window , and then we <unk> the magic .
We have the fourth technology .
Now , a couple of other languages are <unk> .
And of course , when we try to try and minimize the world , more things appear more .
And I want to share with you a little bit about our fundamental model that we 're going to see a few different technologies that are n't important .
<unk> : <unk> surgery .
Five : Five practices guide .
The students are able to show the opposite of it .
Stephen <unk> : If you 're in Latin America , you have to click on the button , " I need <unk> . "
If you 're doing something like this , you can find the <unk> , and even a few days later , it 's all from technology , no matter what it means .
This is teaching instruction .
If you remember what I 'm talking about , my description is : Knowledge and skill .
In a surgery , it 's a bad way to decide how to do it in a surgery .
So what we 're going to do is we go on , we 've got to go back to the old friend , we go back .
Ellen : Well , we 're going to exercise it today .
This is a <unk> .
Take the <unk> .
It must be precisely .
<unk> black .
Your shoulders should be like this .
Now you cut it off .
<unk> , good . Next week .
<unk> : That 's exactly what we 're doing here .
We want it .
We need to teach , to learn .
I can think of it as a tool for <unk> .
And when we talk about all sorts of people , everyone has a mobile phone cell phone , and everybody 's mobile phones can be able to say , like <unk> , patient care , research , software , <unk> and <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> tool .
If you take control of the limits , we have to learn to communicate with other people .
We need this tool to live in a world that becomes smaller and smaller .
Thank you .

When the paintings of exhibition were missing , <unk> <unk> had to be looking for new art materials to <unk> , and so that she found her art <unk> . Now , her work she was on the top , the size of the building -- and she 's going to stand up in the middle of a seat . And she can get it .

<unk> <unk> : <unk> the imagination
And this story is to tell you about <unk> .
When I was 14 years old , I went to this normal material , and the police were always used to land it .
In today , I 'm going to create resilience , <unk> , motion , speed - <unk> -- the size of the world 's size - sized sculpture .
I ca n't make it possible .
I never studied sculptures or architecture .
In fact , I was inspired by the <unk> art Institute of <unk> Art .
I decided I 'd come out of the artists for 10 years , and I ended up calling <unk> <unk> , who was invited to India .
And the commitment to <unk> is that I 'm going to give you a license , and then you get <unk> <unk> .
He did n't get caught down .
I have to find a <unk> .
And this <unk> is on the sculpture .
So I tried <unk> .
But for the big amount of <unk> , it 's extremely glamorous and expensive .
So one day I went to the beach and looked at the river and saw the <unk> on the beach .
And I 've seen this firsthand every day , but this is the point that I see a new way of seeing this new type of sculpture , and it does n't use the materials that have <unk> <unk> .
And the first thing that I did was I was working with these <unk> .
It 's a <unk> called <unk> .
We <unk> it .
And I found that it 's a very soft surface of the polar bear , showing the pattern .
I was <unk> .
I continue to continue working with the traditional tradition of <unk> and <unk> , and in <unk> <unk> .
And I 'd like to give you this beautiful detail , but I want to zoom in in my work , and I think it 's not just that they 're going to be looking at it .
So when I went back to India , I worked with <unk> , and I had a <unk> and a half - and - a - half - and - a - half grand <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> .
Hundreds of people saw this piece , one of the people who saw the city , <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> in his face .
And he asked me that I could n't make a permanent work .
I do n't know if I 'm doing my work at that same time .
<unk> , engineering , permanent , clunky , weak , short , less .
And I spent two years looking for a grain that can <unk> <unk> air , pollution , poisoned the <unk> .
We need something to keep it in the middle of the wing to the center of the traffic .
So we did this 45 pounds of <unk> <unk> .
We have to have engineering , and we need to be able to move through the <unk> and flow in the <unk> of <unk> .
But there was no design that was designed to simulate this kind of thing .
And I found a good urgency engineer , and he designed the ice ice cap in the United States .
Peter invites me to solve this <unk> that 's measurable and elegant .
I could n't use the old way to form the work because <unk> <unk> ca n't <unk> the attacks .
So I worked with a police company , studied a different <unk> of the machine and found a way to make a way to make <unk> .
There 's no language to translate that ancient , unique <unk> that will go into the program , to make machine use applications .
So we have to create something .
And three years later , I had two kids , and we finally started with this 50 - year - old mesh .
It 's incredible that I 've ever seen an enormous amount of work that has been built in this process , and it 's going to spread in the process of the processes that you 're going to see in that process .
This is <unk> . It 's no longer glamorous .
Now it 's now a telescope .
I went down the line of the sculpture .
And it turns out that the <unk> of the winds and the ice goes slowly , and I feel connected to the sky and interact with the sky .
My life is changing .
I want to create these <unk> sculptures that allow them to be used in the world .
I want to share with you two new directions .
In the first generation of ethnic cities , this is its garage , and I thought , we need the sculpture material that we need to do .
And we experimented with these little leopard seals that created the shape of the winds , which can be changed by the wind , and we found that it could change the shapes and the people who were going to change that shape and <unk> it .
And I 'm going to use this sculpture material to track the lawn , and it 's like the X - rays of the city , like the city .
This is the next challenge -- two - year - old conference , and people asked me , if you 're going to <unk> the entire <unk> countries and their relationship with their <unk> , in a piece of work .
I do n't know what I 'm going to start .
And I told you about the <unk> tsunami of Chile in Chile .
It changes Earth 's magnetic field , accelerating the Earth , even <unk> Earth .
I was connected to the States , and I asked them whether they could offer the data for the tsunami and then I 'm going to turn those data into this project .
It 's called " <unk> , " which is the Earth 's Seventh bear .
And I could n't rely on the way that I did this .
It 's extremely complex .
I 'm going to use the <unk> of the metal in a form of chemical fibers that <unk> it to 15 times the time .
Now , the sculpture is completely <unk> , so it 's very easy to be <unk> in the building of buildings , which is part of the city .
There was no software that was able to simulate this complex <unk> and simulation of it .
So we have to make a job .
And then I got <unk> from New York , and I asked me if I could use these concepts to Times Square or <unk> Park .
The new fabric of new structures allows me to simulate these sculptures , and then they 're <unk> them , like <unk> .
They do n't raise the production of money , but I 'm going to make these sculptures to the cities around the world .
Twenty - six years ago I found out the beauty of beauty in the traditional things in traditional things .
Now , I 'm going to connect it with high - tech materials and engineering <unk> to create <unk> , the size of the building .
My art is constantly expanding .
And finally , I 'll tell you about this story .
I 've got a call of friends in the city .
She 's a office lawyer who has never been interested in the art museum , but it 's going to keep all of her <unk> into the floor of the <unk> building .
They 're lying down there , and they sit down in the grass , looking at the shape of the lawn , watching the <unk> and sharing it with strangers .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .

In the unexpected photo of the image , Bob seals released the trajectory of oil into the modern world , from <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the car engine , and it 's always going to go through the ice .

<unk> <unk> on oil
I started working with 30 years ago .
And I was working in <unk> . I realized that this was a <unk> corner .
I want to make a very big picture of the color camera , which makes it a sense of view of how human beings can use land . It becomes an expression of understanding how to use the land , become a symbol of human achievement .
And the point for me is to think about this , by the way of photography , and I think photography 's work is that photography is working on this job .
I found that when I was 17 years old , I found the scale of oil and speed .
Because what changes is the speed of resources , because what we 're doing is changing resources faster .
So I took a whole series of bones pictures of oil , so I 've taken a bunch of <unk> pictures for oil .
I 'm going to draw a series of themes . The first theme , oil - oil and <unk> , and the first themes , the oil spill and <unk> .
And the second theme is how we use : the cars in the city , our car culture is driving together , and people drive together to drive the activities that they drive .
And the third idea is that oil is the end of the oil end . All the <unk> , all the cars , the car - <unk> <unk> -- all of this <unk> buildings ?
And for me , the photography is the way I explore this world , and I 'm exploring this way of looking at the world to find these places .
And I have a idea , which is proposed by a ecology of an ecology , how much amount of carbon emissions need to be spent on fuel . How many types of organic things have to spend on how many carbon levels of CO2 needed to increase the amount of CO2 and how much organic it takes .
It needs 23 tons .
So I thought about how much amount of carbon in my life would be .
And I know oil comes from the ocean , and he 's calculated that the Earth needs a long time to make these energy . He also calculated how long this earth needs to occur .
It 's going to require five years of <unk> , and it needs 500 percent of the energy consumption per year , which takes 500 years to get the power of 500 oil for the next 20 years , where it 's about 500 million gallons of energy per year .
This suggests that the crisis of society is in the face of our society , and it also shows the crisis of our society .
300 million dollars per year , see two oil spills , <unk> and Canada .
They had access to 15 years .
There are hundreds of million <unk> of <unk> around the world , only for five years .
The problem is n't oil , but when it comes to it , it 's not the oil that is not petroleum , and when you start .
So for me , to use photography , I think it 's going to start using the biggest challenges that we have in the age of our time , and I believe that the maximum challenge of the time is that that 's the largest challenge we 're dealing with at the beginning , which we should start with our businesses . And I thought , well , what we need to do is start to crinkle up our intellectual solution to the most powerful challenges we 've ever dealt with in our current era .
On the other hand , 30 years later , I can say to my kids , " 30 , 40 years after I said , we can make a crisis . " And that 's the most important moment we 're going to fix . ' " That 's where we are in the age of the time . Thank you .

<unk> scientists and inventor <unk> show a new way of using functional MRI demos the brain -- ideas , emotions , pain -- and when it 's happening , you can see your feelings .
biology , brain , business , demo , medicine , science , short talk , technology , visualizations
<unk>
Yves <unk> 's technology scans the brain .
Hey , you 're going to raise your hands to the rest of my hands , like I 'm like , kind of like <unk> <unk> to people .
You can just simulate my <unk> .
You can do it in the <unk> of your arm .
And very quickly you can see the way that your brain works in the brain , programming , control in brain activity .
I 'm going to tell you now .
The human mind has been trying to run the inside of the brain for thousands of years .
In this technology , we have the opportunity to achieve it .
People think it 's a bad challenge .
Because you have to put <unk> into the body , and the <unk> is in the body .
It 's something terrible .
You might be <unk> in <unk> .
But now we have this technology to do this research .
We 're going to enter my colleagues in my colleagues .
And it 's using non - <unk> methods .
You do n't need anything to go into the inside of anything .
You can go into the brain of Peter 's brain , actually flies his body , but more importantly we can look at his mind .
When Peter <unk> his arm , you can see that the yellow dots are the place where Peter is going to work .
You 've seen it before , you can see , through electrodes , your brain imaging and the brain is able to show you inside your brains .
And the latest thing is that this program takes a few days to go through a couple of weeks .
We use the latest technology to go through a few milliseconds of views , and then you can see the brain in the scanner at the same time .
And he can see the <unk> of these second second .
And if he could see it in his head , he can learn how to control it .
There are three ways of being affected by the brain : through intimate , medication and <unk> .
And soon you have a second different approach .
And all of you know what we 're going to do is come from mind and brains .
The chronic pain is an example , if you 're a little <unk> .
But if you get down to six months of <unk> or six , it 's because of these neural circuitry that you do n't have to help .
And if we look at the brain , we can make these kinds of values , and then we 're able to make a way to see the way that the brains are dealing with information .
You put your arm on the arm and keep your jobs .
Now , imagine you 're going to see the interior of your brain and choose the brain to do the same thing .
What you see here is the brain of a chronic pain patient .
Maybe you feel incredible , but we 're right now , " <unk> the brain . "
They 're looking at their own brain activity , and they 're making their own pain .
They 're learning to <unk> this path , but they do n't have to take a <unk> .
And what 's shown in the upper left is that what they 're doing is the way they are doing the pain of their brain .
When they control their brain , it controls their pain .
This is an ongoing technology , but in a clinical trial , we 've seen chronic pain , and the patient is getting 75 to 64 .
This is not " Mission - Mission missions . " It 's only your own life .
I 've seen the inside of my brain , quickly .
When you can control your brain , what do you want to control ?
You will be able to understand the aspects of your own character and your experience .
There are some <unk> we 're trying to study , and I do n't have time to go into the literature .
But I want to ask you a important question .
We 're the first ones to be able to enter the human brain , using this technology to understand human brains and minds .
What would this technology look like ?
<unk>
A few centuries later , science has been rejected in the wrong question , and there 's no question that science is not going to be the formula for moral problems , to make us moral .
culture , global issues , military , philosophy , psychology , religion , science
<unk>
Yves <unk> : Science can answer ethics
I 'm going to talk today about the relationship between science and human values .
We think that the moral problems of morality are that science does n't solve and engage in conversation .
People think that science can help us get what we want .
So most people , even today , would say that science is never going to be the important problem for human life , and what do we live in ?
" Why should we sacrifice ? "
" What 's a happy life ? "
And I want to tell you what science and human values do is that a human race is an <unk> , particularly dangerous , especially in our society .
People are saying that science ca n't look like moral and values , because of the fact that the truth is , it 's the opposite of two different levels of values .
And people think that , even if you look at the world , it does n't take us to the utopian column .
But I think this is obvious .
Nature is natural .
It 's about how humans get <unk> .
Why do n't we have any moral compassion ?
Why do n't we worry about rocks ?
Because we do n't think that rocks will be <unk> if we compare it to insects , because we think we can feel much happier than the insects and the pain of the insect .
And the purpose of that is that this is the right thing to do in the middle , and if we 're in biology and the relationship of the natural world , it makes the mistakes that we might have <unk> the heart of our own life .
But I realized that from never a moral and optimistic experience , the experience of experience and trying to change the possibility of experience .
Even if your values come from religion , even if you think about the consequences of <unk> and death , it 's never going to be <unk> in the country , or they 're never burning , and there are two different sensations associated with the experience .
We think that the experience is going to continue to die after the death of the dead , but who does n't know how to die .
The foundation of <unk> is essentially human beings , and we know some facts happen .
And we know that you 're going to be <unk> in a state of state , and all of a sudden you ca n't get a child who can not feed their kids to find a consensus that people can be exposed to peace .
We know that we can deal with this kind of balance to a <unk> situation , like we 're doing now , <unk> , peace , talk about peace , peace and <unk> , in peace .
We know that , clearly , it 's a false way of thinking about it .
Is it really right in the water ?
It 's about not .
Everyone believes that evil is the magic of evil , so they 're immediately starting to blame their <unk> ? They 're not .
We should try to understand what human knowledge is , and whether we can not understand it .
Or let 's compare it to morality .
When we talk about values , we 're discussing facts .
You can see the <unk> of the world , from many levels of levels from the chromosomes , to the level of <unk> and political agreement .
But if we think about human happiness , we have to talk about the brain .
Because we know what we think about the world , our experience and the perception of the brain , is <unk> by the brain .
Even the <unk> of the bomb has 72 virgins in his life , his personality is based on his brain .
So culture 's contribution is -- because the culture will change our mind and change the mode of thinking .
And so there 's a lot of different ideas about how many different kinds of people are going to depend on the <unk> of the human race as a way of understanding , <unk> , psychology , psychology and so on , etc . <unk> .
And what I want to say is that values can be understood in fact in understanding human experience as a solution .
We have the possibility to change these people 's experience .
This is like a moral landscape that is different from the sea , like the <unk> of the human mind , whether the individual or the swarm or the swarm .
And what we need to look at is that maybe there 's a human happiness that we never never ever ever come to .
They 're waiting for us to discover it .
And maybe these experiences are the experience that we 're talking about or victims .
Maybe some of the things that we 're going to experience in the experience , because our brains have a motor , but other people can get it .
I have to clarify it , and I 'm not saying that science can completely be completely <unk> , or the scientific , to answer the moral controversy .
So for example , I do n't think that we 're going to talk to you about the computer , whether we are responsible or not , or we should be elected the <unk> of Iran , or whether it 's going to be in the TED Prize ?
But if this is the problem , they have the answer to the happy , whether we get it .
<unk> , when we try to solve the problems of human happiness , it might change the fact that it changes the way we talk about morality , and changing the consequences of the future .
So for example , in the United States , there 's 21 percent of the laws of legal teachers , which is illegal to use the <unk> , and then you can use a glass of glass , <unk> , or even <unk> , even <unk> .
<unk> kids every year .
And I think you 're surprised , and it 's all about <unk> .
Not <unk> .
And the reason religions are always the ones behind that .
We 're creating the <unk> of the universe , telling us that you do n't want to be <unk> , " or " <unk> <unk> " is " marriage . "
Can we ask a simple question that the <unk> of the kids are going to experience this kind of pain and have the emotional effects of health and <unk> ?
Some of us know that this problem is n't only the solution , and it 's important for us ?
Now , maybe there 's a lot of people who are worried about how happy it is , and how it does n't have any criteria .
And how do you possibly have an artificial happiness ?
Well , if you 're , it 's because of the concept of health .
There is no real argument .
As Michael <unk> says , these concepts change .
The first time in the middle of this graph is 30 years old .
There 's now a life expectancy in the developing world .
Maybe there was a day , because we were n't able to run a <unk> for 200 years of research .
If you have this situation , people get money to you .
And we know that the idea of health change will change the way that you think it is that it does n't work .
A health and a difference between a healthy person is the same between science or theories .
And the other thing that 's going to look at is the moral map , although there 's a lot of <unk> that can be done together , to try to figure out a way to make a managing society .
Why do n't we think of this as an ideal foundation ?
Imagine the way we talk about food , and I will never argue with you .
There 's a lot of food in a healthy diet .
But from no Nobody 's food and <unk> .
And when we ask , " What 's the food ? "
It does n't stop us to research , find more facts .
A lot of people worry about moral moral needs that have a kind of <unk> , not allowed .
For example , <unk> is false forever , and if you can find it , this is not true moral .
Why do we think so ?
Let 's give you a few examples .
If you want to get a beautiful piece of spaghetti sauce , " Do n't eat your dad . "
But it 's also true .
In some cases , the <unk> is a beautiful <unk> .
In some ways , it 's the only one you can do .
But <unk> is an absolute game .
Even in <unk> , it does n't change the fact .
In this moral <unk> , some of the things we should do .
Think about the women , what do you do ?
It 's a method that you can make .
In general , what do we think we do n't like to feel like this is that we feel that it 's wrong in Boston or <unk> , but how can we say these ancient cultures are not forcing their wives to live in <unk> ?
How do we say that they 're wrong when they use <unk> , or they pin them to their faces , and if they do n't get rid of it ?
How do we say that ?
How do we do that , if we 're completely concerned about the happiness or what we need to do ?
I 'm not saying , " Well , you know , I think that women need to be thinking about what it is .
But what does it mean to be the first response to the girl who was raped by his father 's first reaction to her father , and what would that mean ?
<unk> it in your brain : Your daughter is raped ; it 's killing her .
Can you really think that this should be a human happiness ?
I 'm not saying that our societies have the most perfect solution .
So for example , you 're all going to see the <unk> of any civilization - state .
And I have to admit , well , most of you might have thought that there 's something wrong about the most men .
But we can also think of what we 're going to learn in the age of a lot of different women 's age ? "
Do we want our kids in this visual context ?
It wo n't happen . So there 's a middle - to - one ratio that allows you to have a sustainable balance .
Maybe this <unk> is not just a map of the world , and our moral map should have a lot of different kinds of <unk> .
But the point is that there are many places in the world that are not glamorous .
In my opinion , the irony is that the <unk> of the mind that I think is the right and wrong answer is there is a lot of religious answers .
And of course , they have the right answer to moral controversy , because they 've already heard these answers in the secret to hear these problems rather than they think and analyze these questions and their animals .
In fact , in the Gulf of religious religions , people are concerned about morality , and all of the moral issues are connected to humans and animals .
This is why we spend the spirit talking about <unk> , whether it should be married or <unk> or poor , or the poorest , or other things .
But these religions are saying that one thing we need is a value value .
Why does this matter ?
One of those is that when we talk about morality , we do n't have a special religious , <unk> , scientist .
When we talk about morality , we start doing different statements , but we do n't do that in other ways .
For example , the Dalai Lama thinks about compassion every morning , and he thinks it helps to help other people 's pleasure .
We 've got Ted <unk> , and his interest is entrepreneurs and dust and killing these young girls .
And obviously , here we see that every person has a different point of view .
Most of the Western scholars who see this situation will say , " Well , in fact , the Dalai Lama is not glamorous , absolute mangoes , which is the truth of science , and it does n't really talk about social science .
He loves chocolate , and he loves the breathing .
Do n't change them with them .
But we do n't want to talk about science .
This is <unk> <unk> on the left .
He 's a expert in the <unk> .
And if you ask you the most smart physicists , who is the world 's most clever physicist , my experience is 50 percent .
And 50 percent tells you , " They do n't like it . "
So , if I have a physical <unk> and say , " <unk> theory is a <unk> .
I did n't feel that it was n't my choice .
I 'm not a dancer . "
What does n't happen , because I do n't know the <unk> theory .
I 'm baking Ted .
I do n't want to join my <unk> of <unk> .
That 's the point .
When we talk about truth , we have to have some statements .
That 's why we have professional business .
That 's why we should depend on knowledge .
It does n't matter what we say in moral psychology , whether it 's morally morality , or even morality .
Why should we convince ourselves all of the opinions ?
How do we get all of the culture that we 're doing with these things , and what should we be thinking ?
Is n't it important to think about the laws of physics ? No .
But what about the <unk> and <unk> of their happiness ?
Now what 's the world needs ?
And people who acknowledge that happiness is the right and wrong answer to the truth , and the moral truth is that it 's directly connected .
<unk> or individual cultures are deeply concerned about some kind of false problems , and their faith is absolutely impossible .
It does change the way we talk about morality .
And in the world today , what 's happening today is the same thing that 's going to happen in the world , and it does n't have to be anything like that .
We live in a world of dangerous technology , and these technologies do n't have to be invented because of the <unk> .
And I think it 's obvious that we can not be able to respect and celebrate the different aspects of the human mind , as we do n't accept , or whether we 're not going to be <unk> or <unk> , or the <unk> .
We have to admit , these problems can be found .
That 's the most important of all humans .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Let me show you some questions .
There are some people here , or some of the other people around the world , and the anger or the <unk> , some people .
<unk> seems to be a very important element .
But what do you mean when you 're talking about <unk> women ?
I 've lived in <unk> National countries , and I have a lot of conversation in <unk> .
They might say that they would say , " No , no , this is one of the <unk> of women who are special , and it helps us , because that 's not a very reliable argument , but it is n't a fair argument . "
Are we able to use this with a non - cultural perspective and this women talking about these problems .
<unk> : So let me show you a little bit about the question of trying to try and try a short answer , which is that this is really their personal aspiration on the men , where you have to have a situation where you 're wearing an unintended situation ?
If anyone in this room wants to wear a very funny cap , or in the face , I think everybody should do what we want to do , but we have to be honest about these women .
I think we should n't accept their opinions especially , especially 12 degrees at 120 degrees .
Many people want to think about moral progress .
But is this possible ?
And I think I know what you 're saying is that you do n't need to have a moral moral imperative .
You can tell us that if we move forward to 50 years , you want us to see how our world is in moral progress and diversity .
Once we admit we 're going to try to understand the way that the brain works , then you have to admit that we will understand these serious and negative qualities .
We 're going to understand positive social traits like compassion , compassion -- and we 'll understand how that element helps us to have these traits -- or the way that people are talking about the fact that the <unk> system is a way to start to see and mutate and <unk> those facts .
We ca n't stop .
To give you a sense of the <unk> of men , or teach her to become a confidence , she 's a very different woman who is completely different .
I think we do n't need the National Science Foundation , which is really bad to find the <unk> of the women , and we can actually scan every human brain and study each other .
And people really love their daughter , even in this culture ?
And I think these are the right answer .

S - <unk> : As a <unk> of truth , you can still love <unk> .
And you say , " Because I love my son , I do n't want him because he 's going to destroy his head , so I <unk> him with his love .
If you can find a <unk> , you still feel love .
But we have to put happiness in a larger background .
This is our collective <unk> , not a man , and it is n't a male state , and you can put yourself on the bus .

Now not yet , maybe in the future . Thank you for TED .
<unk> : That 's my privilege . Thank you .

Yves Behar on <unk> prevents resistance
I 'm a <unk> <unk> , but it 's not the age of a young age .
At the beginning of the college , I was in <unk> , and I started interested in <unk> .
So , in <unk> , I took <unk> classes , the insects of insects .
And I wondered , how do I get to use it or how to make a difference ?
And then I started exploring the way of protecting plants to protect plants without insects , to <unk> them .
And in protecting the plants of plants , I started with <unk> <unk> , and the definition of the way that we do it is to reduce the <unk> of organic biodiversity .
And that 's the way that it 's going to be that the goal of the <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This creature <unk> <unk> , or we 've got this kind of thing , which has already been around the world for thousands of years .
But in about 12 years , people are beginning to start realizing how to develop and use them , and how they 're going to use it , or how nature <unk> <unk> , to achieve people 's purpose .
Because <unk> <unk> is in your yard .
If you look at the glasses of the <unk> , what do you see here ?
This is a <unk> lens .
Yeah , <unk> .
<unk> it .
You 're just going to jump to the leaves , you 'll see a little bit of insects there , and there 's only one <unk> and a half a millimeter , or two millimeter - , - <unk> - size spiders .
So this natural <unk> is happening everywhere .
I 'm sure the front of this building .
So look at these plants .
It 's all insects , we need to know how to find it .
Okay , let 's look at this , and look at those examples .
What is <unk> ?
What would it do for plants ?
What is it about ? <unk> <unk> , or what we say ?
So , what I 'm going to talk about is insects and <unk> , or capitalism , we call it good .
The insects -- those who have <unk> organic biodiversity , and spiders or DDT or Christians , they are the organic organic organisms .
Let 's look at this .
This is a <unk> , an <unk> centigrade , a tree ultrasound , because it produces a lot of <unk> .
And you see that in the middle there is just the mother and the head , which is about two daughters , and on the right there , there 's a <unk> .
And then you can know what it is .
On the right hand you can see the <unk> leaves , the underside is the tip of the iceberg , and on the left , there 's a shot of violence .
And these <unk> used to make the leaves out of the <unk> , and then they made these leaves as white as the white .
But the next is nature 's <unk> <unk> .
This is a little <unk> mite -- and this is the same amount of <unk> pollution , one millimeter , a millimeter and two millimeter length , and it goes down .
You can see this lady on the left here -- the <unk> of <unk> , and the body 's body is <unk> off the on the left .
About five minutes later , it turns out , as you can see here , just the <unk> of the leopard <unk> -- full of <unk> <unk> , which is the ones who are already <unk> in the next side , and on the right , there are two <unk> that are the women , the left side is a <unk> .
Well , for the first 24 hours of food , it 's about five hours per day , or if you 're non - <unk> <unk> , maybe 15 or 20 percent of <unk> capitalism .
In other words , they are hungry .
This is another example : <unk> .
Okay , right now in Israel .
It 's fast in speed , and you can see the harmful <unk> , in the plants , around the Arctic , on the mountains , at the bottom of the hill .
Well , it 's about the <unk> of the Amazon .
In <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There 's no format .
This is called <unk> <unk> .
They seem to be really happy .
Next we can see the harm .
And these <unk> will produce some <unk> , <unk> liquid , called a little <unk> shape in the plants .
And you can see the typical <unk> leaves because of the black accumulation of <unk> and <unk> that made it into the green , it turned out that it 's a black cloud .
And the next <unk> is <unk> , which is the <unk> of this auditorium .
This is not a predator .
We 're talking about <unk> , not two feet , but the <unk> of the foot .
This is <unk> <unk> , which is about two millimeter long , and it 's a very , very fast wing .
This is the process that you can see here , as you 're doing .
It 's on face to face on the right - hand side of the face of <unk> , and it 's going to be able to put a <unk> in a regular body , a <unk> that goes into the <unk> fluid .
Well , it 's only trying to get rid of the way .
It <unk> <unk> , <unk> different liquid , but it did n't use it .
Yves <unk> is a <unk> in <unk> .
And after a few days after the temperature , <unk> will win , and the <unk> larvae come from inside the inside .
This is natural phenomena .
That 's not the magic of fiction .
And then , you know , it 's going to happen at your time when you 're <unk> .
That 's the final result .
This is the final result : <unk> -- <unk> / <unk> .
This is the reflection of the death death , and we look at it . In fact , the process of <unk> is spreading almost a few minutes later .
It 's almost entirely a adult .
You can see this in the whole documentary . This is just a few minutes .
If it 's just a <unk> , it will immediately end up and leave it immediately , because they 're alive .
It 's only about four days long , and it has to be about four million <unk> .
It means that it has to get 400 degrees of <unk> to put it into their fluid .
That 's not the case .
There 's a lot of other beans , and it 's just the last example .
Let 's look at this <unk> <unk> .
Well , for those strange words -- we do n't know what this is like , <unk> , these are just <unk> .
This is a very small , <unk> , terrifying <unk> .
Look at this <unk> .
This is not the <unk> of the fittest , not <unk> .
This is a <unk> who ca n't eat it because it 's filled with <unk> <unk> .
Next , <unk> <unk> , a little bit of a small piece , say small because it 's really tiny .
You can see that it 's a black man , two larvae .
Next to action .
And the <unk> <unk> , for a few minutes , has spent a couple of minutes to <unk> it , and then the rest of the world is changing .
If we divide this little bladder , like in the <unk> of <unk> , they 're <unk> flowers .
Look here , when those bladder leopard <unk> cleaned up <unk> , the flowers are filled with these <unk> .
So this is a very serious situation .
It does n't have the fruit for the growing fruit in the growth of <unk> , and it does n't have a lot of money .
In this case , everything is great .
But the problem is , you can see that this is a <unk> phenomenon -- corn and its predator .
And we 're doing this .
In the midst of Israel , the collective farm of the <unk> farm in <unk> , in the <unk> is <unk> .
In other words , what we 've done is we 're going to zoom in and zoom into the natural world , or the effects of natural selection .
In the new city of <unk> , we 're trying to <unk> these little <unk> of those little leopard <unk> -- those tiny <unk> worms -- and so on .
It divided into many different areas .
Well , there 's a great ecology there . There are <unk> on the side , and the other side there is <unk> , so it 's very , very gentle , <unk> in winter , but they 're very hot in summer , which is the <unk> conditions .
Well , it 's not about the gene , right ?
There are no organisms that have no genetically engineered <unk> .
We do this from natural nature , and we 're going to offer the best conditions , in the greenhouse , or in <unk> , to <unk> them very rapidly .
In fact , that 's exactly what we 've got .
You can see from the microscope .
In the upper left - hand corner , there 's only a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
We 're in a glass <unk> in <unk> .
Look at this little bottle .
There 's 10,000 <unk> of <unk> shrimp .
One of the founders of <unk> is only a few Christians who have no access to a garage , which is the strawberry <unk> , in a hundred year seasons , to solve those <unk> <unk> .
And by doing this , we can create the number of times a year .
And that 's what I say to the natural mechanism .
We 're not starving .
Instead , we 're going to have these <unk> systems that have been destroyed by chemical <unk> .
We use these invisible glue that can come up with the fact that we 're going to get rid of the use of chemical spray , which can be able to achieve more natural <unk> .
This is our concept .
So , what do you do ?
And by this point , you can see that , by the way , through the <unk> of <unk> , with <unk> .
For example , in Israel , we 're going to <unk> corn <unk> , and to protect the <unk> of the spray , there 's been more and more , by the way , the unit of Israel is <unk> <unk> .
And the face of Israel in the Israeli -- even 80 percent -- is even more than 80 , especially the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So it works .
Now , some of the problems , especially when you ask those things , farmers : why would you choose biology ?
Why ?
But , no matter what you ask you , everyone will give you a different answer .
So for example , this place in Israel , the <unk> , large <unk> of the ice , has -- and there 's the most great farming of Israel in the city , especially in cities , and if you drive on the desert , you find it in a central city .
And if you look at this , you can see that you 're going to see the rest of the family are <unk> these corn , and those <unk> are n't glamorous , not <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And the use of this technology is very safe , and that 's why we ask the <unk> why to get the answer to <unk> <unk> .
And the answer is , many of the deaths will be worried about fair problems , worry about the <unk> of <unk> , like the germs of an engineered tissue .
Again , this might happen quickly .
<unk> , whether bio - <unk> laws , or Nature doctrines , are very tough .
This is almost impossible .
Because it 's a species of evolution ; this is an natural probability of natural selection , not like biology .
The answer is , public demand .
The public population increased the uses of <unk> chemical <unk> , and more of the <unk> <unk> found that they ought to be able to fix chemical reactions to <unk> chemicals .
And even like this , <unk> <unk> , she 's interested in these little ones , whether it 's fusion or <unk> and the hands of the hand , in the presence of crops , on the outside .
And finally , I want to talk about my perspective , or say , it 's my dream .
Because you know what it is .
Look at this one .
If we calculate the cost of <unk> <unk> , about five million dollars .
Just look at the world on crops in crops .
I think it will be <unk> .
It 's about two billion dollars .
So this has a huge amount of need to climb .
So actually , what do we do ?
How do we get out of this , or make this one in every year ?
First of all , we need more health , good , <unk> creatures , more <unk> , whether it 's a lot of migration , or in <unk> .
Secondly , making money to make more powerful and more robust requests to reduce the chemical <unk> .
And third , <unk> is about understanding the <unk> of the industry .
So this one is less expensive .
And again , it <unk> .
So I ended up on the last panel : These are the ones that we 're talking about .
<unk> is the <unk> of nature <unk> , the Ansari or the other countries , and in this country , it 's called a new opportunity .
Thank you .

<unk>
Why are some civilizations that are going to be <unk> ? Through the <unk> <unk> of <unk> shrimp , <unk> corn and <unk> in the United States , the U.S. <unk> , which we 've shown is a <unk> crisis from us , and he 's also optimistic .
culture , environment , global issues , history , social change , society , technology

<unk> <unk> : Why social social society
Social explosion is <unk> , and I believe that all of you have been interested in it , but then the social societies , the <unk> civilization , civilization - <unk> civilizations , in the last 10 to 20 years , to <unk> the civilization of civilization .
But there 's a lot of places in the world , and there are thousands of years of history , which is not completely discarded , like Japanese , <unk> , computation and <unk> . Obviously , some social resources are more vulnerable to other societies .
How do we try to understand this ? Of course , this problem is very glamorous , because there are some <unk> societies that have broken up , like <unk> , Rwanda and <unk> . There are still some social societies like Nepal , Indonesia , Thailand .
So what about the United States ?
There 's a lot of social or bad societies in history , or <unk> , and how should we avoid Calcutta ?
And the answer to this question is obviously from <unk> , if someone told you , " These societies will fall , only one aspect of the way . " So you 've got to react , and it 's a very complex problem .
So what do we do ?
In the process of analysis , I 've designed a " 350 <unk> " : This is actually a list of the list , <unk> me to explain about social <unk> , and I 'm going to figure out what 's going on on the Greenland Ice Force .
This is Europe in Europe , and so we can understand people who are very well understood and their motivation .
In <unk> , a group of <unk> came into the <unk> of soft pollution , and then moved back to <unk> .
How do they all be extinct ? Well , in my avatar , first one is the influence of the environment , because , for the sake of <unk> , people destroy their lives in this particular case because they have to do it in the same cases because it takes a lot of trouble to make the problems that they need to do because they need trees to make <unk> .
So even though they 're a social social society , they ca n't get rid of it when they catch up , in the second list of climate change : change , or <unk> -- or maybe <unk> .
In this case , 14 century century , particularly 15 , the climate heat , but it 's not the right factor , because they 're in the <unk> <unk> , and their performance is going to be cold , so why do n't they do that ?
And the third thing in my list is that , with the <unk> of the neighborhood , it 's allowing us to be able to protect it , and once it comes from <unk> aid , normally , they 're going to <unk> that society , in this case , at this point , because of Norway , there 's one reason because of Norway , it 's because there 's a lot of water , because it 's because it <unk> up , because there 's one reason to <unk> the water , which is <unk> .
And in my list , it 's a relationship with <unk> .
In this case , their <unk> are Inuit and <unk> and people , and they do n't have the " <unk> " photographer , but they 're not <unk> by the <unk> of the chamber and we know that they sometimes have a <unk> , or even more importantly , they 've got to get rid of that <unk> <unk> .
In the last list of my list : a social political , economic , social and social phenomenon , these things can cause a <unk> to solve the environmental problems of it , and in this case , because of the fact that culture is <unk> in the building , it 's a very difficult thing to do with the <unk> of <unk> , which is that they 're going to spend a lot of money on the buildings , so they do n't want to get the problem with <unk> and <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
So what about social society ?
And in the last five years , I had my family <unk> <unk> , and at the end of the day , when I 've been able to harvest it as a young man . At the beginning , <unk> seals seem to be the <unk> state in the world .
But it turns out that there 's a lot of problems that are really serious .
That 's the same thing for me . One : humanity 's influence in the environment .
Yes , this affected a lot of resistance to the <unk> of <unk> .
And in order to take the <unk> , and to control it , it 's almost two billion dollars per year that 's worth two million dollars a year , but there 's no reason why the soil <unk> and the deforestation , the forests of the sea , or the forest -- and then you can see the second <unk> of climate change , which is really a bad thing to see , because the world 's <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> by the fact that the ice is changing , so that it is a good
And the third thing that I have on my list : 50 percent of your relationship with <unk> , and half of them are n't going to vary , but by the way , the <unk> of <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- and so on .
<unk> : Contrary to the relationship with <unk> , the problem with the rest of the other areas is that the <unk> of <unk> are attacked by an <unk> -- in some problems that <unk> our oil supply , terrorism , corruption , and so on , in my list , it 's a social political , social and social phenomenon that seems to get rid of their problem .
" Long value " is dedicated to the <unk> of the explosion , <unk> and <unk> , and NGOs and non - governmental organizations in the past , but it seems hard to work .
When I think about social problems , regardless of the past or the present society .
I have to ask myself , what do you get ?
In some way , as <unk> , unfortunately , there 's all sorts of unfortunate implications of the family , the same thing , every single <unk> or a social society , and the reason for that is that there are all kinds of things that are <unk> in the early world , but in a very short moment , it 's <unk> the <unk> of <unk> -- and , in fact , a lot of social <unk> has been <unk> by the beginning of a few decades , so that the world is going to be <unk> and <unk>
Similarly , the Soviet Prime Minister of the Union , in the early years , even over the course of a decade , or even 10 years ago , they 're still the most famous times .
There 's a phenomenon that is very similar to this : <unk> percent of the population of germs in the world .
These societies are <unk> because they 're able to get rid of the resources that they have , or they do n't have their need .
In <unk> , bacteria <unk> . Every generation , it 's only the end of the day , and then , first of all , <unk> will have 15 <unk> of <unk> in the next three or four , but the generation is only about half the space , only by the first three - and - a - half - hour , the bacteria , when you 're not going to have the same amount of food .
And it 's very commonplace to think about the phenomenon that a society is so commonplace .
And this is a phenomenon that can be understood : if you want to think about a society where you 're going to care about the social , it should n't be the benefit of the math ; it 's a social GDP ; you ought to be able to look at it , and that 's the <unk> of <unk> , which is , in fact , a lot of social <unk> that we do n't fully fully understand , so that , of course , we 're not fully aware of it .
This is that it 's about nine different environmental processes , each of which is very glamorous , and those <unk> are <unk> the <unk> of the ice , which has a lot of <unk> in the area of a <unk> <unk> , where they 're <unk> from the continent , but maybe these are the most subtle ones on the coast of Asia , with a huge amount of minerals in the continent , to the continent that protects the coast of the Pacific .
All of a sudden in <unk> , all of the Pacific islands come from the continents from Asia , but in the midst of China , the <unk> of Alaska , because it 's the lowest amount of productivity , we 've always been looking at 1999 .
So there 's a couple of social processes , because these subtle environments are more vulnerable than other social values , and then I 'm going to talk about the third thing that 's going on in the middle of the world , which is , in fact , that the students are doing a lot of money on the <unk> , the curriculum that teaches me that they do n't recognize what 's going on ?
How do you <unk> the people in the upper <unk> and <unk> their homes to <unk> ?
When did they feel at the end of the last 10 days ?
Do n't they know what they 're doing ? What can they do about the effects of the environment ?
And I think the answer to this is that , assumption , our civilization can <unk> , then maybe , in the next century , people will be curious about what 's going on in 2003 , where they 're not aware of it .
In history , we found <unk> <unk> , but it 's the same thing that we 're looking at . So , I try to analyze a couple of reasons to explain why these societies are not able to deal with the problem , and why they do n't realize that this society does n't make any difference , or why , if they 're not going to solve it ?
And this is a problem that I just <unk> with two reasons .
One possibility of a society that <unk> society is : <unk> short - term interests and long - lasting conflicts here , this is the short term of <unk> <unk> , which is very short , especially when it comes to the <unk> of the world , and the values that allow you to do the best , social decisions , the policy that helps to be able to make a social decision , <unk> in the world , to <unk> this social decision , as well as it can make the decision - on - and - a -
For example , in <unk> <unk> , it 's a very glamorous social society , and the social leaders of the society are the most important , much more glamorous , more <unk> and more resources , which are more powerful than those of these people who are going to do it , but the <unk> that <unk> the land , the bottom - to - demand ratio is to make a difference .
Those are really very recent conflicts in the United States today , especially to think about the policy of the American policy that the U.S.
<unk> , this is about how social social decisions make <unk> decisions : <unk> .
And the second thing that I 'm going to show you is , there 's a social situation , and sometimes it 's really hard to create , or advocating some appropriate decision , especially when it comes to <unk> values , , sometimes , of course , the <unk> of <unk> , which is a very , very clever thing , is that , for example , that <unk> <unk> is very difficult , but that 's what 's going on in the middle of the world , because , in fact , <unk> and social <unk> are <unk>
And the reason for Australia is to continue to develop sustainable development , even though it 's in the state of Europe , that 's because 250 years , they 've always been the U.N.
But today , their identity , but it makes it hard to adapt to them in Asia . So , it 's a tough way to realize what you 're going to bring to the problem .
Where would that happen ?
Well , we all know that the world is possible in the future of societies , the <unk> of society , and that 's where most of these <unk> are the nearest , but the first time , they 're not going to be more than 50 years old , which is , in fact , there 's only about 12 years , so that it 's a <unk> , a lot of <unk> -- and there are a few years to do it for the rest of the system , because , of course , it is about 50
And my answer is usually : one of the things that we should do is to give the point that the second thing is , I think we just need to do one thing about what 's going on .
After all , we have <unk> problems , every one , all of us .
We have to bring them all the way , and even if we solve 11 , it 's 12 , we do n't have the problem , for example , when we 're dealing with the water issue , the <unk> problem and the population , but it does n't solve a problem .
In fact , we 're in non - <unk> , suggesting that the theory is n't possible .
In the decades of the future , these problems are <unk> .
That means that , right now , the people who are watching this talk are the ones who come up with this <unk> , and they 're going to see the fact that the <unk> are trying to be solved , in the age of 60 , for example , but our kids , or our children , will be able to see this moment , as well as the ones that have ever seen a moment of this period of moments .
These are the questions that are going to be solved : one thing is : we 're going through some kind of <unk> , <unk> - <unk> state , for example , a little bit of action , or something that can be done in some ways that you can change the way that we could change , the war or the disease , and that 's the same thing , which is , in the last few decades , it 's <unk> .
All of the big problems in the world today are not going to be part of our control , because the biggest threat we face is not the asteroid , and if it 's , we 're going to zoom in .
On the contrary , all of the most powerful threat we have , actually , is that we can make these problems , and we 're actually able to solve those problems . That means , by the way , our power is better .
Well , what can we do about this ? What do we have to do with our choices to change the future , and you can do a lot of things . There are many things that we 're not aware of , but it 's important , we 've got to figure out -- but there 's no time to try and do it .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> wants to bring insects to people in their diet , and he talks about the case of <unk> insects . And he 's going to give <unk> to <unk> .
agriculture , environment , food , health , insects
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : Why do n't we eat insects ?
All right , I 'll show you the insects in our food .
I want to know how many people ate insects . Can you eat insects ?
Very much .
But anyway , you do n't mean everybody on Earth .
Because people on Earth are eating insects .
But the people who ate it have a lot of money .
Why do n't you ? Well , what is insects ?
<unk> animal animals are the insects .
The insects that you see in this room are just part of this .
There are six million insects on this planet , six percent .
There are only six percent of the insects , but there are six percent of the insects .
In fact , if we think about all of biology , we 'll get more .
The truth is that all of the animals on earth , animals , species of species , 80 percent of them are 22 legs .
But if we calculate the average amount of individuals , 20 percent of the weight will be 200 or 2000 , which is the Earth , every single one of you .
In <unk> , insects are more <unk> than humans , and we 're not living on a human planet , but in a insect .
The insects are not only about the nature of nature , but they 're almost not very concerned about our economy .
A few years ago , a conservative estimate of the U.S. economy is now serving a billion dollars per year .
This is a very big contribution to the U.S. economy , and it 's also the consumer .
And then I looked at the same military economic economy in Iraq .
<unk> trillion dollars .
We all know about Iraq .
The insects , they do it in the same kind of <unk> for the American economy , but it 's not glamorous .
The contribution of insects is not only about the United States , but for any country in the world , any economic economy .
What 's the insect doing ?
They clean prey , feed crops .
We eat the third quarter of the fruits of fruit .
They <unk> <unk> . They 're other animal sources .
The insects are on the bottom of the food chain .
<unk> ate insects .
<unk> animals are not exception .
But the small animal of the insects will also be <unk> in large animal , even larger animals .
And at the end of the food , we 're eating these animals .
A lot of people ate insects .
This chart , you see a little leopard in China , <unk> -- about two million people .
If you get out of the <unk> , like in the Grand Canyon , you can pick up the fish that you want to eat , to choose the insect .
They 're going to cook very special insects .
So what you 're seeing here is , I 've got a bag of <unk> and <unk> , bees , etc .
Every day you get <unk> .
Around the world , people are eating 1,000 tons of insects .
There are more than many mammals that are eating , like <unk> , pigs , or lambs .
A thousand species .
Now , you might think that , that 's just the people who are not going to eat , so we do n't have it .
But we 've seen a lot of people who ate insects , even though it 's just an accident , but I 'm going to tell you , we eat insects .
You ate about 500 <unk> per year .
How would this be ?
<unk> burning , <unk> , chocolate , the <unk> -- you 've got anything that has insects , because the insects are in the world , and they 're in our crop .
Some fruit go into the <unk> .
If you 're trash , they 're made of trash glasses .
If they 're close enough to be <unk> King of <unk> .
This is where you see currencies .
But there 's also something that 's been made out of the window , as they get a lot of food , and they have all sorts of stuff , which is not a problem .
In fact , why are we going to get a vote of <unk> ? Are n't there ?
Actually , all of our <unk> proteins are much more processed than we think .
So the <unk> of food is a very good source of protein .
Now you say , " Okay , we 're not careful about the insects . "
But we are in a lot of food .
<unk> insects to eat insects . In the slide , I have two examples of <unk> and <unk> or <unk> , and so many of our food production is <unk> in nature .
<unk> is <unk> , or they 're killed , and it 's killed .
And <unk> is the insect who is carrying a new product of life .
There 's a huge amount of production in the <unk> of 150 dollars a year in <unk> , in Peru , in Peru .
It 's about 30 <unk> .
A <unk> is 30 <unk> .
So <unk> is very precious , and we use it to <unk> food .
Now , the world is changing , and I 'm here , everyone on Earth .
The population is rapidly increasing .
There 's about six billion people on the planet , and in 2050 , they 're going to increase about 90 billion .
That means that we have more people to raise money . This is a problem that makes a difference .
And this is the problem with <unk> last last year .
How do we raise this world ?
Notice the data on the left , and it says we have more than a third of the population , but that needs agriculture to improve 70 percent .
This is particularly because of the world population , not just the amount of increase , but we also become rich , and when they 're wealthy , they start eating more meat .
In fact , <unk> percent of the agricultural food is very high .
Our diet is made of a lot of animals , and in fact , most of us are here from livestock , fish , <unk> , or <unk> .
We ate a lot of meat .
In the developed world , the average amount of meat in the United States is about 120 <unk> , and some other countries are a little richer , but in average , it 's about 80 <unk> in the average , but it 's a 70 - <unk> - old [ average ] [ ] ] <unk> [ <unk> ] " <unk> <unk> . "
That 's a lot of money in the developing world .
25 <unk> .
But it grows very quickly .
This average , in the last 20 years , from 20 <unk> to 50 <unk> , will continue to continue .
So if the population of the world is increasing , the average consumption of their meat consumption goes from 25 <unk> to 80 <unk> , other people are living in China and in India , and our demand for meat is going to become really big .
And of course , we 're not saying , " <unk> demand is just about us , do n't think about them .
They are similar to us .
And I have to say , in Western countries , our meat is too much .
We actually do n't have to eat very few people , I know because I 've got a long time to do it .
They get proteins from any food .
But the production of <unk> food is a lot of problems , and these problems will be more common .
The first problem we 're dealing with is human health .
<unk> are like us .
In medicine , pigs are <unk> by human populations , and we can even <unk> the pig to people .
This suggests that pigs have a lot of common diseases .
And the pig , pigs , and human viruses can reproduce and spread , because it 's because of the <unk> system , the germs that can vary , it can generate a shared relationship .
The typical <unk> that happened in the 19th century was this one .
This new disease is <unk> .
You eat insects , because insects and we are very similar , so this virus does n't happen .
This is a little bit of the insects .
It 's also <unk> .
With 10 <unk> , you can get a <unk> beef , but you get nine <unk> meat .
If you 're a entrepreneurs , what do you do ?
Ten <unk> , you 'll get maybe one <unk> or nine <unk> .
Now , we 've only chosen this one <unk> , or five <unk> .
We do n't have the option .
That 's <unk> <unk> .
This is the second benefit of insects .
There are still environments .
If we use 10 <unk> -- it will produce one <unk> beef , a lot of <unk> flakes , lots of noise .
If you make insects , you create a new insect , and you have less <unk> .
Less <unk> .
And also , the <unk> of insects , <unk> , and the greenhouse gases , are much more <unk> than <unk> .
So the insects have smaller anesthesia , and insects zoom in like cow <unk> .
This is the third benefit of the insect .
And of course , there 's a big question , which is insects that can have <unk> diet .
All the <unk> of the insect , fat and <unk> are very rich .
In fact , it can be <unk> with anything we eat today .
Even on heat , the insects are good .
It 's more than 10 <unk> , or six a pound , that can provide the same equivalent .
This is the <unk> of the insects .
I can continue to say a lot of good insects , but it 's never happened .
So the question is , why do n't you eat insects ?
I 've given you least at least four <unk> of a insects .
We have to try .
Even if you do n't like to eat insects , you 're not going to be able to adapt to it , because now we 're all <unk> for livestock .
This is not just where livestock is between livestock and <unk> , but also to produce <unk> and transportation .
We can increase a little bit of the cost of a rainforest , but it 's soon going to be a force .
If you remember , we need to improve 70 percent of the 99 percent , but we ca n't do it .
So we 're best from meat , from beef , to eat insects .
Eighty percent of people in the world are eating insects , and we 're just part of a few people , like from Britain , in England , across the United States , <unk> and other places .
On the left side , what you see here is a market market , and people are going to have a lot of money to sell all sorts of insects for dinner .
On the right hand , you see the <unk> .
People ate <unk> , not because they did n't eat , but they thought insect were very tasty .
The insects are really good food .
People have a lot of different insects .
There are many things .
In fact , many of us are <unk> like this : Juliet , one thing is sweet .
Who do n't you like eating shrimp ?
Very few people like eating shrimp , but textbooks , crabs or <unk> are very similar .
They 're all faint .
In fact , <unk> is in the land , and the <unk> will make us very rich .
So why do n't we eat insects ?
Maybe this is an illusion problem .
We 're not accustomed to eating insects , we do insects . These creatures interact with us .
That 's why we 're trying to change people 's cognitive capacities .
And I <unk> with my colleagues , <unk> von <unk> , where we can tell people what insects are , what they have , how special they are .
In fact , there are no insects , and we 're not going to depend on this room because if the insects are extinct , we will be very rapidly extinct .
If humans have <unk> , the insects are <unk> .
So we need to adapt to the idea of eating insects .
Some people think that the insects do n't kill themselves .
The insects are already <unk> .
In the Netherlands , the entrepreneur 's created insects , in the audience , there 's one side of them , and they 're on the top .
I wonder , you 're going to buy the insects in the supermarket , not looking at the food chain , but as animal proteins appear .
Maybe in 2020 , when you buy insects , it 's a insects of insects .
They 're going to be the most glamorous .
A creator of the Netherlands .
There 's a lot of design to make the insects .
In the Netherlands , we have a very vibrant mailbox , and in her lap , she asked insects to bring insects into the major brands .
And when she recently invited the European Union .
When she came up , she had a minister in a senior hospital , and all of a sudden all of them would eat insects .
That 's not my ally .
This is what happens .
Why do n't you ?
You have to try something .
A few years ago , we have the <unk> of <unk> , in the Netherlands , <unk> insects , eating insects .
And I think very soon , when all of us ate insects , it would n't be the big news because it was normal .
So everyone will eat the insects today . I 'm going to say that .
I have a risk to try and try to let it go .
Bruno Giussani : <unk> <unk> : Let 's see here .
<unk> <unk> : It 's all protein .
BG : They are the insects that you see in the video .
They look very <unk> .
They 're using <unk> or whatever they do .
<unk> : Thank you .
<unk>
And instead of showing you a little bit more advanced , Tom <unk> shows one of the most exquisite instruments of human history -- <unk> , which is <unk> by thousands of uses of using the sky , as he tells the old things that we do n't have to do something like a new thing .
astronomy , history , consumerism , science , technology
<unk>
Tom <unk> : demos the <unk> century
And most of the people in the technology , most people are going to be able to do this , to connect us more and more to the world .
But what I 'd like to suggest is that progress is not just the progress of progress , progress does n't have a change in change , when change is happening .
And to prove that I 'm going to tell you how to solve a simple , personal problem .
This is the problem .
What is time ? How time is it time ?
If you look at your iPhone , it 's easy to tell you what time is .
But I want to ask you , if you do n't have the iPhone , how do you know that time ?
Or a six years ago , how do you know time ?
How do you get the information ?
One item is going to take a lot of time to get the information that is <unk> .
In the moment , the existence of <unk> has been lost .
But in the end of the century , the <unk> was at the end of the day .
<unk> is the most powerful tool of all time .
<unk> is a <unk> device , and it 's <unk> .
So , <unk> <unk> is a part of a star of stars .
This is the pump of <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of <unk> <unk> has a little bit of work with <unk> and <unk> other parts .
If you 're a educated kid , you need to know how to use a <unk> , and also to understand how you make <unk> .
Because the first thing about <unk> 's book , the generation of writing in English , is by <unk> <unk> .
Yeah , it was the <unk> <unk> , and Yves <unk> wrote his son , he 's 11 years old , Carl Sagan .
In this book , a little bit of <unk> could come from the foundation of the building .
The <unk> of <unk> is <unk> projection .
And generally , the <unk> projection is a three - dimensional image of the sky to move into a smooth , <unk> space .
This idea is relatively <unk> .
Imagine that Earth is the center of the universe , and it 's covered with this Earth 's sky .
Every single piece of light on the sphere comes from a flat plane , and these data is recorded .
So <unk> is in the central city .
And the <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> to a <unk> center , <unk> , December and <unk> .
And that <unk> stars will be smaller than the <unk> of <unk> .
And the <unk> is <unk> with the whole <unk> system .
It 's not about <unk> functions .
It 's going to be a very different amount of scale with two <unk> systems .
This is the sun , the moon and the Moon , and this <unk> place .
They 're in the sky where they 're looking at the <unk> , looking at the plate .
So how do we use this device ?
Please raise a few seconds .
This is a <unk> . Is n't it nice , right ?
The Oxford Oxford Museum is <unk> .
You can also look at different sections of the world .
This is the <unk> cycle of <unk> , and the rest of it is <unk> .
This is <unk> . Did you see it ?
That 's where it moves .
And in the interior of <unk> , it 's a <unk> pattern .
The <unk> patterns are <unk> with the <unk> of the Earth .
This is a piece of paper , and on the back of the plate , there 's a few other devices and some <unk> , they can help computation .
I 'm really keen about one person .
My graduate work is a <unk> .
This <unk> is a <unk> , and it 's an <unk> of 15 15th century .
This is probably about the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
But anyway , it 's better than my house , and I 'm going to add the house on the street , which is the whole street -- and maybe there 's a school , or some -- church , church .
They 're <unk> .
Let me show you how it works .
Start with first first steps .
The first thing is that you have to pick a star from the sky , and of course , it 's just going to do it in the evening of the night .
And tonight , you can see that it 's going to be very clear that it 's going to be <unk> <unk> .
There 's a star that 's called <unk> , which is called " four <unk> . "
Step two : you 're going to measure the <unk> of four million <unk> .
And it 's got to be <unk> , and that 's what I can look at .
Okay , let 's show the height .
It 's about 26 degrees . You ca n't see it .
So , <unk> , the <unk> of the stars in <unk> .
There is Yves <unk> here .
And the <unk> is <unk> <unk> , and it 's good for moving the whole sky , so it does n't matter if you 're going through the sky .
When everything happens .
One of the same things that happened to the sky , it appeared .
In some way , I 'm going to be the model of the universe .
And the last step , it 's used to be able to go into the pond to the steps , and we can learn what time is .
This is how it works .
And I know what you 're thinking . " That 's not the problem , right ? We do n't need to do a lot of work for time ? "
Take a much more time compared to the iPod , using <unk> .
But this is a little bit more <unk> , when you use iPod or iPhone , you only learn about time .
And the little <unk> of the <unk> was looking at the sky .
And he also knows what the sky is .
This little <unk> will not only learn about time , but he also knows that the day of <unk> and the sun and the sun 's sun .
And he would know when he was <unk> .
And ultimately , he will <unk> all the place in the sky .
There 's one of the founders of computer graphics and computers in the computer .
And when you take this object to the user , it will know that the characteristics of this object .
And <unk> allows us to connect with the night sky , and it can make us look at the sky and shape the glass and the texture .
This is just a function . It 's about 350 , 800 , 400 .
These are the ones that come from the text , and the normal use of that is 50 percent .
And behind the <unk> is <unk> and measurements , they have <unk> function .
You can start a poll . The <unk> did something like this .
And <unk> can also be used for all sorts of mathematics .
universities are going to study classes for <unk> .
There was a long history of history .
It 's about 90 percent .
The theory of <unk> is about <unk> <unk> .
There 's all sorts of shapes and structures .
This is <unk> , that 's what it 's doing .
And I think that <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of art .
It 's a very glamorous portrait of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> will be evolving like technology .
The first <unk> is very primitive and <unk> .
And more advanced <unk> became cultural .
This is just from Oxford .
And I think this is just the same , because it 's a folded shape - shaped shape , but what it represents is the <unk> sky .
<unk> have never been able to be glamorous .
So , can <unk> have his own <unk> ?
And he 's not glamorous about <unk> <unk> , and he can use glue to make <unk> .
So what did <unk> give me ?
First , it reminds me that the wisdom of our ancestors is <unk> by people .
This is a stunning device .
All the technologies are growing .
There are mutual <unk> between each other , <unk> .
It 's a technology that makes us tick .
Meanwhile , I think we lose perception of sky .
Understanding sky , understanding the relationship between the sky and the ability to understand what the real answer is .
I think that <unk> is a remarkable device .
So what do we do ?
Basically , we can engage with the subtle connection between the world .
Know <unk> , you have to go back to this feeling , and how we feel connected to how to interact with the world .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
<unk> <unk> needs to be <unk> control , but for health care , she needed to wait for <unk> to waiting for a surgery . She took her way to solve problems .
culture , health care , innovation , medicine , short talk
<unk>
<unk> <unk> on new change
Do n't I start ?
Chris Anderson : No . Let 's do it .
<unk> time , responsibility for her .
<unk> : Oh , the rules are too glamorous .
I mean , I 've got <unk> .
But I do n't have <unk> .
I was doing surgeries for <unk> surgeries before I did .
Do you know that surgery ?
<unk> , <unk> , terrifying , unless you 're David R , because he thinks surgery is only about <unk> .
And of course , David , if you do n't have your grandparents , will be beautiful .
Anyway , this is a lot of <unk> Chris invited me to share with you .
But first of all , I had two things that had to be done .
That 's two .
First , I 'm Canada . Number two , that 's the tiniest part of my house .
In Canada , we have good healthcare institutions .
That <unk> <unk> is free .
And everything in the end of the seven - year - olds is the final <unk> .
My <unk> had been <unk> me .
I finally went to see doctors , which was free .
She 's going to give me a surgeon , which is free .
When I arrived , I saw him -- almost a year .
That 's the price of free money .
I 've got a lot of money , and he took me a few free X - ray , I 'm very excited to see these X lines , you know , it 's going to be a little <unk> . I do the market for market analysis .
So he said , " <unk> , we have to help you . "
I 'm going to give you a <unk> -- probably about 18 months .
Or a 18 months later .
I 've been waiting for 10 months , and now it 's more than 18 months .
You know , it 's a long time to start with the TED conference , and I 'm going to start with the time .
In this TED , I do n't have new <unk> .
In Africa , I do n't have new <unk> .
<unk> , I do n't have new <unk> .
My bad , still <unk> me . Very sad .
So I left his office , and I walked out of the hospital and there I was .
And seven kids have to think about it .
Oh , yeah .
Do you know how much it does ?
We do n't think about it .
We 're not going to talk about it -- oops -- that 's not the case .
In fact , when we travel abroad , we 're trying to persuade ourselves .
" You want to say , " No , do n't you . "
Hey , you 're Canada ? " I 'm also , hey .
" That 's great . "
So , no , I do n't forget my lists on the front of the list to the bottom .
It 's about 70 percent of the old ones who are willing to <unk> , if their purpose is just to <unk> the golf balls .
No , no . I 'm going to die .
Now I was walking on the hall of the hospital , of course , because my <unk> . I needed a partnership .
And then I got hooked .
The little hospital in the hospital is written by <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
They brought me immediately .
There 's no standard background in the background .
The <unk> <unk> , because the average ancient age of the hospital is 75 years old .
Yeah . They need some <unk> .
So soon I was on the top of the blue line , and I had <unk> <unk> , 19 years old .
I can do it .
Every Friday morning I was working on my work .
And every time they sit together , I would say , " What are you doing ? "
And then I would tell them , " 18 months later I could get paid for surgery .
No , no , that 's great . "
All hospitals in hospitals know this brave young man .
And the next day I did my work with my surgeons was that I came from <unk> .
So I looked at the doctor with my wife and <unk> .
And I put them in my doctor 's offices .
And you can think , when doctors walk into the doctor , I can know what they see .
And a few months later , my surgery took a lot of <unk> after a couple of weeks later .
And now I 'm going to tell you a little bit about what I can do because I 've done the hospital in the hospital .
But you know , I feel ashamed .
Because two reasons reason .
First , I 'll be very good for my new <unk> .
And secondly , I 'm going to continue to live in my service , my biggest <unk> .
Even when Congress is <unk> , they are also used for social purposes .
<unk>
In <unk> National <unk> and <unk> Foundation , <unk> - <unk> <unk> , the <unk> Lab , talks about his team , and introduced his group to the seven <unk> of seven - year - old <unk> -- and there 's some <unk> that they 've made for five years , but in the end , he can also tell you about five mysteries -- the most important one .
chemistry , engineering , robots , science , technology
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : <unk> his seven - ray robots
The first one is called <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> experiment .
This robot is inspired by three legs of nature .
But you 're seeing animals in the natural world ?
There is no . Why do we have a <unk> robot ? What do you do ?
I mean , look at the current epidemic .
You should know about <unk> <unk> , " World <unk> " and the film of the world .
What you 're seeing here is a very popular video game game , and in fiction , threats , threats of Earth are fooled .
But my robot , <unk> , does n't move like this .
This is a real dynamic <unk> .
What I 'm going to show you is how robots move .
It 's 180 degrees of <unk> in the air , and one leg in the other direction .
This is his walking approach . But the study of our human species , human beings , does n't use a muscle to take a leg , like robots . Right ?
We actually put a leg out of one leg , and then <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ...
Use your body , the body forces , like a pendulum .
We call the concept of passive forces .
In the body , what you 're doing is , you 've got to transform <unk> for <unk> .
It 's a process of <unk> .
So , despite all the animal animals in the natural world , we still are inspired by this robot , so it 's <unk> robots .
What you see here is our next goal .
And we 're going to make robots like spring - sized , and then you get out of the way .
And then <unk> the legs , like <unk> , three legs of the robot swimming , and start walking .
This yellow region is not swimming .
This is an image of a camera or a type of sensor , because it 's a lot of high - speed <unk> , and you can see a little bit of it from the <unk> that 's going to look at it .
We have two types of <unk> .
The first size , in the back , is <unk> .
And in front of that , it 's a little <unk> .
The problem with <unk> is the robot <unk> . We 've got so many motors , like <unk> goods .
So , we decided to make a mechanical institution , and we can use a motor , to replace all of the motors .
This is a mechanical solution to the mechanics .
So in the upper part of the body , we 're walking around the lab , and it 's going to walk in the laboratory .
It was n't perfect . This was <unk> , so we did .
The second is <unk> <unk> .
It 's a " <unk> " robot .
<unk> , or " <unk> <unk> . " And every time you 're going to get rid of it , it 's called <unk> robots .
We developed a wheel .
Let me show you a story .
This particular video is called a method called <unk> .
It 's only to use <unk> sensor sensors , and this robot goes out of the floor , on the ground , to change it .
It 's only about the information that 's involved in <unk> sensors .
But it 's a very extreme terrain , a three - year - lapse segment of the video , and it will turn into <unk> patterns , where robots are using <unk> and the <unk> system to try to figure out obstacles and <unk> the size of a <unk> , to make a sense of <unk> .
You might never seen this robot before .
This is a high - speed robot , which is what we 're developing , called <unk> robots .
Is n't that cool ?
When you drive your steering steering , it 's called <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> like this .
And for those small <unk> robots , they 're going to move into the opposite , and it 's <unk> and <unk> to the opposite direction .
We can do a different approach to <unk> robots .
And it 's a video that 's going to be <unk> in a button , with the same <unk> .
<unk> , we rely on the length of reality .
And the change in <unk> change is the size of the Grand Canyon , and it 's going to turn forward to <unk> .
These are some of the most powerful examples of <unk> that can be done .
This robot is called " <unk> , " which is the <unk> <unk> remix .
I 've been talking to a lot of NASA 's scientists , and I 'm telling you , in <unk> , the most famous thing about the <unk> Lab , which is that scientists do n't always tell me that it 's really interesting , <unk> and scientific markets .
But it 's not going to be <unk> yet .
This inspires us to build a climb on this .
That 's the winner .
It 's three legs , and maybe it 's hard to see , but there 's a <unk> , a dot , which is the best <unk> .
Once they 're good , it 's going to calculate the distribution of <unk> , and the calculation is required to put the force that 's going to make it , and it does n't make any sense .
Once it 's <unk> , you get a leg , and then you can use <unk> , and it 's a little bit over there .
It can be used in search and rescue .
And five years ago , I was doing a research research in NASA <unk> Lab .
They have a robot called <unk> .
And based on this , we developed a robot called <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> robot .
We developed our <unk> software software .
We put a very interesting <unk> .
The students love interesting robots . You can see the robots on the ground .
It 's trying to walk through rough terrain , dunes , depending on water , and the size of the heat is change .
The robot is adapting by the <unk> of <unk> to success .
In addition , it can also do something funny .
We have lots of <unk> .
When it comes to the computer , the robot goes down , and you 're going to tell you , " Please . My name is <unk> . "
Welcome to the <unk> of <unk> , Virginia , in Florida .
This robot is a <unk> robot .
We do n't have time to talk about <unk> , I 'm going to show you .
This is some early possibilities .
The <unk> on the skin is moving .
It 's a <unk> , and it 's called <unk> . She 's called <unk> .
We 're working with scientists from the University of Alabama and engineers , and develop <unk> robots called <unk> .
And we <unk> , as a spell , it moves . It 's like a scientist named " <unk> . "
This robot is the nearest project . It 's called <unk> .
They have <unk> machines .
There 's a lot of good machines on the market .
But there 's a few million dollars a year .
It 's not true for the arm , because it 's expensive .
We think about a very different approach to this problem .
It does n't use electric motors , but it 's an urge for <unk> .
We developed these new <unk> .
It 's <unk> . You can actually change the size of the wing and change your size .
And what it does is it <unk> a empty <unk> .
It can also take the <unk> of the chicken , <unk> chicken or like this .
Best of the best is only 200 dollars .
This robot is actually a series of robots , which we call <unk> , high power <unk> .
This is an <unk> robot .
This is a <unk> machine .
It 's about 12 power machines in this machine .
But interestingly , the user interface .
These blocks are scaffolding .
<unk> is probably the first time that she can use a lot of different ways to do it .
For example , in Iraq , there 's always a lot of <unk> seals on the road , right now , in <unk> , right now .
It needs to be a lot of time and spending - on - demand cars for control of the <unk> cars in the area of it .
And in this case , the arm is very uniform , and the student is probably the first time to use it , you can do it very complex tasks , <unk> objects , things like this , very counterintuitive .
This robot is our star .
We have a <unk> robot , smart motivation , <unk> robots .
We 're dealing with the <unk> robots , and we 're very interested in creating a small <unk> robot .
And in 2004 , it was an addictive thing .
Much more , how do you use a motor ?
Can we do that ? What control do we do ?
This robot has no sensor .
It 's <unk> control .
You know , if you do n't have a controllers , it 's a problem .
And based on that , we did the right <unk> , from a little beginning .
In 2005 , I <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> .
But , as you can see , it 's wired , and there 's a <unk> . We still use the outside power .
In 2006 , it was time to find <unk> .
To him , we give it to the electromagnetic <unk> that we need , two million <unk> -- two <unk> camera cameras , eight <unk> , and four <unk> sensors , the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> kids are all <unk> .
You do n't need to paste remote control .
There 's no <unk> line . It looks around , looking around and look around the sphere , trying to figure out that they 're going to try and rip it down .
Look at it . This is our first testing , video : <unk> !
There 's a competition called robots .
I do n't know what your robot is .
The robots are <unk> robots .
The goal of the robot is , in 2050 , we have the size of our human population , <unk> <unk> , and also win .
Very practical target . Very chaotic , we think we can do it .
Last year in China .
We 're on the verge of the United States , the first team in the <unk> game , the first group of <unk> <unk> , for the first time .
This is in <unk> .
<unk> three <unk> of <unk> .
Good . Okay .
<unk> tracking , <unk> , fight against .
It 's a very impressive image . This is actually the <unk> of <unk> .
This photo is beautiful .
This is the <unk> <unk> robot , and we want to go back to the United States next year , hoping that we 're lucky .
Thank you .
There 's other ways .
In the last year , it actually interferes with the <unk> Symphony Orchestra .
This is the next generation , <unk> , smaller , faster , more powerful .
It 's showing its ability to show it , " I am <unk> , I 'm very strong . "
I can do <unk> <unk> .
It goes away . This is <unk> .
You can see it in the lobby .
And we 're sure that this will be the first time to run the <unk> of the United States , so that 's why <unk> cares .
Okay , I 'm going to show you a funny robot .
So what do we do ?
Where do we come from thinking about this ?
How do we develop these ideas ?
We <unk> <unk> cars in cities . We won the 50 million dollars .
We have the first blind car in the world .
We call the challenge for the blind driver .
There are many other robots .
These are the <unk> we win in 2007 , and we 've won from the robots .
We actually have five <unk> .
First , where we get from where we get .
Where do you get inspiration from ?
This is my personal experience .
When I was in front of the morning , I sat down , and I had the eyes and my eyes , some <unk> and other shapes .
And they made a bunch of machines .
And I thought , " That 's great . "
And then I have a <unk> , and I had a special <unk> of <unk> LED , because I did n't want to <unk> my wife .
I saw these paintings , <unk> my thoughts , and sleep .
And the first thing that 's going on in the morning is the first thing that goes on , I opened the laptop .
It usually is empty frames , sometimes , <unk> <unk> , and sometimes I ca n't understand my way .
What do you say to you at 4 a.m. ?
I have to figure out my <unk> .
Sometimes , I 'll see <unk> ideas , and I have this moment .
I 'm going to run up to the <unk> , and I sit down in the computer , typing my thoughts . I 've got a solution .
And when we need to suggest , I 'm going to find the best ideas in my potential , if I have a research suggestion , that 's how we start our research plans .
Just a little bit of inspiration , not too much .
How do we develop these ideas ?
In the robots , we have this wondrous brain conference .
We 're talking about the question , social problems , things like that .
So before we speak , we have a rule .
<unk> is : No .
Whatever it is .
It 's important because , many times , students are afraid of people who are afraid of others .
Once you do this , you 'll see the creative creativity of students .
They have the idea of <unk> in the room , full of creativity .
This is how we develop these ideas .
It 's not enough to do that , but it 's just not enough to think about it , just not enough .
A TED moment , I think he 's Moses , right ?
And he 's in the TED Prize school to teach creativity .
In fact , this is <unk> .
People are only doing so much , remarkable ideas and creative projects .
If you want to go beyond , beyond the <unk> of the robot , we need to do a lot more challenges . We need more . These are schools teaching .
And <unk> and <unk> have been rejected by the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the other <unk> .
For us , <unk> , engineers , scientists , these tools are in classrooms .
<unk> , <unk> .
<unk> , science , physics , more , today , biology , biology .
These are the tools we need .
The more tools for the tools to be more effective than the bad ones , the better knowledge of our tools .
So education matters .
Not only that , you 've got to work very hard .
I 've always been fascinated by my students and try to work .
This photo was taken in three a.m.
If you 're three or four , we 're going to see the students in the lab , and you 'll see that students are still there , but they have interest .
That 's the last theme . Remember to find a <unk> .
This is our job of success , and we 've got a lot of fun .
I think people are <unk> . This is our job .
Come here . Thank you very much .

" <unk> is a glamorous word , to describe it to the land of the desert , " Ellen <unk> . " The world 's two - thirds of grass is becoming a warmer place , and it 's a great thing to be able to protect the <unk> of a desert ; and he says -- a stunning factor for the rest of its life , <unk> to <unk> the world .

Ellen <unk> : How to deal with the desert and transform climate change
The most powerful perfect tsunami is <unk> us .
This is a perfect event in the perfect storm , but it 's going to transform a real reality , which is really deeply true , and we 're doing a belief that we can use technology to be able to deal with these problems .
Now , our perfect storm is the result of the population , the growth of 100 billion people , and the land is going to become a desert , of course , climate change .
<unk> : No , we plot technology to solve fossil fuels .
fossil fuels , carbon - <unk> -- coal and gas -- never only the only thing to change the climate change .
<unk> , a glamorous <unk> is to describe it as a land land , because we built too much <unk> .
Nothing else .
And I 'm going to put it in most of the world 's offices .
I have a very simple message to you that it 's much more promising than you think .
We have a lot of <unk> in our environment .
These places are almost impossible to form large <unk> chains .
Whatever you do , Nature will cover these land .
Some of our environments have a couple of months of rain , and then there 's a few months later there , and there 's a couple of months there .
Fortunately , we can look at the Earth from space , and you can see the ratio of different landscapes .
You do n't see the green thing that you 're looking at , and the brown area you see here is the largest region on Earth .
I think the world has two thirds in the world .
This photo was taken in the next 25 days of the desert desert .
And as you think of it as a boat , it 's about 200 tons .
That 's 1,000 ice rain on the day of every square acres .
And the next day is this thing .
Where does that leave ?
Some of the water breaks down , and most of them are <unk> the soil , so it 's going to be very close to the way that you 're going to go through the <unk> .
Now , because of the water and the carbon elements are stored in the soil , when we lose soils , we released carbon - <unk> .
It goes back to the atmosphere .
These are the ones that you 've heard in the world , and it 's just the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , as soon as this happens .
But if you 're not looking at it , but look at the surface of grass , you 'll find that most of the soil in the grass is <unk> , and rarely very few algae are covered on top of it .
This is the cause of <unk> , and we look at the end of the end of what happens .
Now we know that <unk> is caused by livestock , mostly cattle , goats and goats , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the surface of the soil and released the surface of methane .
Almost everybody knows this , from the <unk> <unk> to the golf camp , and it 's all about education .
These are the environments that you see , <unk> Africa , is where I grew up , and I love the wildlife , I do n't love livestock because the livestock causes ecology .
I 've read about the experience of ecology in university .
Now , I 'll tell you some new stuff .
We believed that the world is flat .
We were wrong , right now .
I want to invite you to join my education and teach me .
I was young , a young biologist in Africa , and I came up with a project for the state of the National Museum of Park .
Shortly after -- this is the painting that we 've done in 1950 , <unk> people to protect animals , and then the land starts to become a park .
There 's no luxury , so we suspect it 's a lot of elephant , and I 've found that the number of people who are going to get rid of the elephant and then I propose to reduce the amount of levels that can land .
For me , I have to admit that this horrible conclusion is a political bomb .
So governments have a <unk> to evaluate my research .
And they <unk> , after all , in the next year , we 've taken four <unk> elephants to stop land .
<unk> , not better .
I love the elephant , and this is the most sad , biggest mistake in my life , I 'll bring into the grave .
And there 's a good thing .
It <unk> me to love my life to find solutions .
I came up to the United States , and I found that the American National Park was going to look like this .
There are no violent violence on this land .
And I found that the explanation of the American scientists did n't think it was a drought and natural conditions .
And so I started collecting and analysis , and the entire American Western district I found , all of the <unk> of all the particles in the United States , are all over the place to prove that this is going to stop it , but I 've found that the research is , in 1961 , to 2002 .
These are the images of the researchers who come from studying the research of climate change , and they 're thinking about the unknown process .
And obviously , we never understood what caused a lot of civilization , it destroyed the civilization of the world , right now .
We never found it .
It 's like the surface of the ice that looks like this , and I 'll say , well , it 's going to be the place where you 're not covered in <unk> , the same big place , when you do n't have to go to the place where it 's <unk> , when you do n't want to go through it much more .
You 've changed this place .
Now , as you 've done earlier , if the areas of the world are going to grow up in the area , fast growth goes up to more than half , 50 percent of them are changing .
But we ca n't understand why this process is just a thousand years ago ?
Why has doubled recently ?
We do n't understand that .
What we did n't know is that these giant <unk> in the world , as well as the <unk> of the species , is continuing to grow a lot of <unk> , and these <unk> animals are connected to animals like <unk> .
The main way of <unk> animal <unk> is the social life , the more powerful , more <unk> .
There 's a lot of <unk> in their own food , and they have to continue to move over the way that they 're going to get rid of the atmosphere , but the <unk> soil , as well as the animal does it .
This is a typical <unk> <unk> .
It was just about four months of <unk> , going to eight months .
Notice that the <unk> went into the long - term <unk> .
All the surfaces that you see on the bottom of the day are <unk> , otherwise , the grass and the soil will start dead .
If it is n't animal lazy , it 's a very slow process to melt , this is an extremely slow processes , and they 're going to depend on the atmosphere , to <unk> the oxygen , which produces the surface of the Earth .
In order to prevent this situation , we 're using <unk> .
But the only thing about <unk> is that the carbon is released into the atmosphere , and it 's even worse enough to be released by the grass that 's released , is more harmful than 6,000 cars .
We 're going to get out of Africa every year in Africa , and almost no one cares about this .
As scientists , we understand that <unk> can clean up plants to grow plants .
Look at this grass grass , what do we do ?
Remember , I talked about most of the world .
Do you understand ? We ca n't use the way that we have the same amount of animal , because it will cause the land and the climate change .
We do n't need to burn <unk> and climate change .
So what do we do ?
There 's only one solution , and the only way that I repeat the world , the <unk> of the climate and scientist , which is really incredible , is the use of livestock , to <unk> them as a temporary animal and a <unk> behavior .
This is the only choice that humans choose .
That 's it .
And we 're going to experiment in this little experiment . This is just the beginning .
We 're going to use a large amount of livestock to simulate the behavior of nature , right now .
Now the soil has been covered by completely completely covered , and there 's also a lot of panic associated with <unk> , <unk> and other kinds of <unk> -- the audience , if you 've done it , can understand that this soil is already able to absorb the soil and keep it into carbon .
We do this , and we do n't have to grow the soil on the top of the tree , but it can also grow .
When I first realized that we did n't have alternatives as scientists , only with <unk> livestock to change climate change , and I had the real truth .
How should we do that ?
<unk> have spread a million years of <unk> , knowing how to <unk> and migration , but they create the largest <unk> of the world .
The modern <unk> research has been associated with a hundred hundred years of research , and these studies doubled , as I 've found in Africa , you 've seen the image of the United States .
The land is obviously more powerful than <unk> and migration , and we ca n't understand the complexity underlying nature .
And our biologists have never been trying to solve this complicated thing .
I do n't try to reinvent the wheels , but to see if there 's something that can be <unk> .
I found out some of the technologies in the workplace , and the demand for our biology is to bring these technologies into the process of creating a whole job called " <unk> <unk> , " which is a planning process , a process that tries to understand the complexity of nature , the way that we 're dealing with nature and our social , our environment .
Now , we have young women in Africa , and how to teach the animal how they 're going to make their animals a huge amount of <unk> , how we <unk> the <unk> of nature , where we use it , because we 've got a lot of land in the way that we 're doing it .
Look at these results .
This is close to us in the harbor .
It was just about four months of ice that was going to go into a long - term period of ice .
But you 'll see , almost all the rain , from the surface of the soil .
And despite the <unk> , the river did , and we had 15 million people in our food supply .
Look at our land , the same kind of <unk> , and see .
Our <unk> fluid , health .
Good .
All of the <unk> and the bush , all of a sudden , is very powerful , and everything in the Gulf is a little bit more <unk> .
That 's how to increase the <unk> corn and the goats , the process of <unk> , to simulate the SETI process for elephant , <unk> and other animals .
But before we start , our land is like this .
This is the <unk> and the future of 30 years of <unk> than anything .
Look at this tagged tree , and look at what we 're doing with livestock in the natural world .
This is another piece of <unk> and <unk> , and the little <unk> in this painting , we 've got 30 centimeters of soil . Right ?
And if you look at this change , it 's just using livestock to <unk> nature .
This is some <unk> tree , because the land is greatly renewed .
And in this area of Mexico , I 've done this in the little mountains because the changes are huge .
In the ' 70s , I started to help a family in the <unk> desert , and you 're looking at the grass on the right to see the lawn .
If you look at this <unk> change , there 's been completely completely anti - <unk> by the process of natural nature , which is more <unk> , and they 're living on their flag .
The <unk> <unk> is becoming the desert .
The person in the middle is a researcher in Argentina , and he 's been documenting this continent since <unk> years of <unk> .
They put two million <unk> of <unk> as a series of things , and they 're planning to be a process of nature , but their record is about 50 percent per year .
Now in conflict , they 're <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , which is the only hope that they want to feed their family , saving their culture .
The <unk> of the animal depend on animals .
And I 'm going to remind you that most of the world is so similar to the fate of human fate , the areas that are the most violent areas , there are <unk> people in animals as the only food source .
This global behavior led to climate change , and I believe that the importance of this is at least as much as fossil fuels .
And the worse thing is that it 's starvation , poverty violence , social <unk> and civil war , as I told you , millions of men and children are getting suffering and death .
If this is true , even if we 're leaving fossil fuels , we can not stop changing climate change .
I believe that I 've shown you how we 're going to use it very low - cost .
We 're going to do this globally , about 15 feet of land in the world , to show that the effects of the project are even more <unk> than I know about carbon - <unk> , and if we do that , we can reduce the atmosphere for the <unk> of <unk> soil , where we 're able to increase the amount of carbon .
And I was almost almost anything that could give us a little bit of the planet , and your kids and children shared a larger wish .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Ah , Chris .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I believe everyone here , I have a lot of problems to ask , and I want to <unk> you .
I just miss a little bit .
When you start this experiment , <unk> a whole bunch of animals , but what do they eat ? What do you do ?
How do you start ?
Allan <unk> : We 've done a long time , only once we have to eat the production of <unk> , which is 100 percent .
A couple of years ago , we 've got the worst land land , and when I was five pounds per gallon , I did n't find a <unk> in a hundred miles of ice , where we 're going to increase the size of the animal , the number of year - to - the - year ratio , which is the <unk> of our animals , to <unk> the nature of nature .
I want to explain a little bit about how technology is , but it 's like this .
CA : This is an interesting and important idea .
So we 're going to try and interview you , and I want to know more . We can share with you . <unk> : Yeah .
CA : This is a very surprising talk , really astonishing , and you 've heard our bus .
CA : Thank you very much . Yves : Thanks , thank you , thank you , Chris !
<unk>
The professional career of art , and she moved into the <unk> state of <unk> states , to try to do a bold search to design the community . She was designed in a school called <unk> <unk> -- the purpose of an <unk> - <unk> curriculum , which is <unk> for the world of the state , with the opportunity for <unk> and the new world .
design , education , poverty
<unk>
<unk> <unk> : A design for the world
This is a story about a place where I 'm a storyteller .
One of the stories about the public education and the village , how do you improve the story .
This is <unk> it 's in the U.S.
To give you a clear idea to it , this is what we 're going to zoom in in the state , if we zoom into this state of state .
It 's about two hours of <unk> .
There 's a huge climb , and there are a lot of <unk> .
Most of the land is used for <unk> .
It 's only about 20,000 people , and it 's <unk> .
So it 's about 27 people . Every time you 're going to get to 10 people , you get 10 .
<unk> is one of the major culprits in American villages .
There are stories everywhere around the country , even in the U.S.
We 've found this sign .
That means <unk> <unk> .
That means that <unk> is the end of the city .
[ <unk> ] -- those are the people who are capable of walking out there , and they 're never coming back .
The village and the cities are much more dependent on the level of the government , and it 's going to take a higher amount of higher levels of the advancement .
<unk> is not exception .
Maybe the biggest problem with this leopard <unk> is that the relationship between the community , the shared investment of the future , collective investment in the world .
Now , the entire American community of America , only for the United States , is only 20 percent of the population , but in the rural areas .
So <unk> is n't just the village , but it 's very poor .
It 's the <unk> of the poorest <unk> .
A third of the kids lives in poverty , and this is become the rural poor .
The economy of farming is in agriculture .
The major crop is <unk> and <unk> , and the peanuts .
The biggest motorcycle is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is in <unk> .
What you 're seeing here is <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
There 's only 2,000 people , and so many other people are already saying , " <unk> for years . "
This is a flat or a <unk> building , much more than the number of times .
And the number of people in the room are <unk> with a hand , and you 're absolutely the most passionate love of the hand .
But they did n't have a <unk> in the entire <unk> , without any theater , no director .
It 's not even Walmart .
And it 's about 60 percent of the people in the human population that are black , but in <unk> , because most of them are going to learn a lot of <unk> .
So in <unk> , it was <unk> .
This is a picture of a <unk> student in the local newspapers , and you can see the difference .
So the <unk> of the public education system is really <unk> in terms of <unk> .
There 's no source of <unk> . There are only eight percent of people who have antennae or antennae .
So this is a big deal about education .
In fact , two years ago , in the next three years , there 's only a third of the people who have been at eighth grade in math and in English .
It sounds like I 'm describing a lot of images about this region , but I can assure you that we have good news .
And I think this is one of the largest wealth of <unk> , and it 's the person who is this person , Dr. <unk> <unk> , we call him <unk> Dr. <unk> .
And he 's a responsibility in 2007 , in October , of liberal arts systems to <unk> .
He used to be in <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
First of all , he first started building the first <unk> schools of the old ' 80s .
He was absolutely <unk> spiritual and visionary , and he was also the reason that I was in the <unk> and working .
In 2009 , the <unk> invited us , <unk> design -- a nonprofit design company , which I built and collaborating with him , and to repair this <unk> idea to <unk> this family .
And he invited us especially , because we 've got special design processes that have n't been able to connect with those sorts of things that are in the midst of a lot of creativity or design , or in a place where you do n't need to do it .
In particular , we have six design <unk> that are probably the second thing that we 're not designed to design , but with who we are designed , it 's based on this , when our design depends on the <unk> .
It 's designed to design with other people , and then it 's going to make a difference from the inside .
At the beginning , we 've been invited to be there in <unk> , so we 're in the next time in 2009 , and it 's all about half of the time .
When I say , I mean , the people in the <unk> project , but it 's more atmosphere , and I 'm talking about my relationship with my partners , Matthew <unk> , an architect and a <unk> .
So fast , we live in <unk> .
I had to take this picture of Matthew <unk> , because if he knew I was using it , he would kill my major career because he 's wearing his <unk> .
This is our beginning , we live in there .
We call it the place .
By the year of this year , we know that we 've already <unk> this place .
We 've been born with this land and the people who are working on this continent , and we 're doing a lot of art in the villages of the city and do n't work in every area of every place .
This is a place where you 're going to get to trial and test different things .
We have <unk> motivation .
It 's really precious to do that , real satisfaction .
But there 's a lot of reason for our personal personal reasons , because there is a huge amount of demand there .
<unk> innovation is essentially empty .
There is no real explanatory designer there .
And we 've seen a chance to see a new opportunity as a tool that does n't have to be transferred to the opportunity to make design as an new tool .
We came up here with the goal of the design of John <unk> and <unk> , and this is why we came back here .
But except for those , we realized that as a community , <unk> is extremely powerful for CEO and to interact with the rest of the world .
So the final goal is that we have , yes , to design the education , and find how to make education into a community .
In order to do this , we have three different ways to get education and design .
And I have to say that these three are three things that we 've already done in <unk> , and I can now have a very confident relationship that says , well , we have the ability to work with other villages in the United States .
Three things of design are designed to design education .
This is the most obvious part of education and design .
This is a learning space for teachers and students .
This is the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and we 're using these <unk> - <unk> <unk> .
And for doing this , we 've done a lot of different things .
First of all , a series of innovation for the computer Lab .
The computer lab in the last school is especially , like at the end of the <unk> schools , every two weeks of school will have an e - computer computers in every two weeks .
You 're in the wall , and you 're doing the tests , and you 're doing the tests .
We want to change the way that students use technology to create a much more active , more <unk> , even more complex social space , but we hope to increase the skills that teachers use these spaces .
This is the laboratory of our high high school church , which is very much like this laboratory .
And every time he had a <unk> , it was the first place he took to visit the <unk> <unk> .
That means that some teachers can come together in this educational district where we call this <unk> landscape .
It enabled the foundation of the building as a child as an adult , for example , in games , to travel , and to <unk> the core curriculum .
Now the game of kids are playing is called " <unk> , " and kids can learn from this game .
In " <unk> <unk> , " for me , <unk> is divided into a bunch of <unk> at the end of the summer , and it 's going to take a piece of chalk on each one of the <unk> and wrote a number of figures on every <unk> of a <unk> .
And then she 's going to come up with a mathematical problem , like four times four , four million pounds of <unk> , 40 times a year , and then you get 16 .
The <unk> of the game is allowing you all the players that you 're sitting on , and you can win .
It 's really amazing to learn landscape .
A lot of the classes in the classroom , and it 's a better thing to do with <unk> , especially boys , who like to get out of play , do n't fear what they 're doing .
So in education , I think the most important thing is to share the way that teachers share things like this , so they have the power of <unk> and hope and hope .
This is Mr. <unk> , who 's the manager .
And he came up with a teacher who had been trained to win the day and won the lottery , " To me , he feels very proud .
And three times the second one is designed for the whole system of education .
This is the most complex .
It 's the level of the system to recognize how education is managed to be managed for what 's going on .
In many cases , we 're not changing what 's going to change , but in terms of changing people who make change in rural areas , in the middle of the villages , it 's really hard to make it easy to do it .
So for us , this is a researcher called " <unk> <unk> . "
There are thousands of these green lines .
This is the cost of money to raise a home for every student in the house of every pupil for each student .
Now I can only say that the entire <unk> is only about 10 percent of the family 's own computers .
And the only place that got wireless buildings is that school buildings , or " <unk> ceiling , " and I always always go there .
In addition to people who are excited or do n't know what these green dots are , they 're starting to imagine how to be able to make community sacrifice more to be more intimate .
It allows us to think about how to go out of the campus and think about how to do it .
One of the first computers in this summer is that we 're helping Dr. <unk> <unk> , which allows us to be able to engage the classroom with schools and schools .
Three of the founders of three <unk> are the most exciting things that we 're doing right now , which is what we 're doing right now .
Think of design as education , which is that we can actually teach it to design , not like normal design classes that are n't normal , they 're building rockets , and they learn how to learn physics , it 's based on the way that design thinks and the values of the community .
And that means that designers are no longer a coach ; it 's the teachers that we need to create more creative jobs for the next generation .
And the design of design as education is to provide a lot of <unk> to change a whole bunch of universities .
These are ongoing activities that you need to engage in the face of the kids who really learn the core curriculum .
So we started thinking about creation courses and institutions , especially wood and <unk> , and they 're all working on kids who do n't read college kids .
It 's a process of professional training .
It 's a professional education .
And this project is like trying to make a <unk> for your mother , to make a difference .
There 's been a lot of funding to fund institutions that have gone out of institutions .
So what we 're trying to do is , if we go back to the beginning of the process , we look at what 's really important about the community , and it 's going to be the design of a lot more important and creative design .
So we went through this kind of vague idea that Dr. <unk> and <unk> used for a year at the beginning of the year of high school students .
Four weeks later , this curriculum has begun to start with my <unk> , Matthew and I <unk> to get paid for high school students , who had just spent a little bit of a difficult and complex process .
This is what it looks like .
In the two quarters of the curriculum , August of <unk> and <unk> birthday , 18 hours per day to learn three hours a day at the same day .
And in this period , they 're going to do all sorts of things from <unk> and doing some research in the studio to go back to the university and design the concept of the brain , and then <unk> the idea that the encyclopedia will be able to figure out how they can <unk> their prototyping and to building their prototypes .
In <unk> , they get a cool job .
They work through the <unk> project , and they 're going to work with us on the community , design and building these projects .
First project , it 's going to start building the next summer , and then the sun 's next - year - to - shoulder , which is the second equivalent of the <unk> <unk> system .
These are actually looking at the real project , and we hope that the students will be like , " This is <unk> , I feel very proud .
I want you to look at three of our friends .
This is <unk> .
She 's 15 years old .
She loves agriculture , wanting to become a high school teacher .
She wanted to go to college , but she was going to come back to <unk> , because there 's her uncle , she 's a place where she becomes a " house , " and she gets a strong hope to make her feel good .
So <unk> <unk> provides a place where she teaches her , so she can pay attention to her <unk> .
This is Eric , he 's a <unk> .
And he loved the room and he wanted to become a designer .
And for him , <unk> <unk> gives him a place where the technology of designers became a technology called designer <unk> , and this includes the <unk> of the wood of <unk> and metal and metals for everything .
This is Tony .
And he 's 16 years old , and he loves to hunt , fishing and fishing , who liked to use his hands to do what he would do with his own , <unk> <unk> , which means that he can do it through his head .
He 's interested in <unk> , but he 's not sure so , so if he does n't go to college , he can still nurture some of the technologies that are involved .
The design truth really is a different type of classroom .
This is a building in the area where we 're going to be in our future , and now it 's our classroom .
Let 's get students to the community , to interview your neighbor , where they buy food , and why to buy it .
And that summer in summer , they 've built <unk> , and it 's also the sponsors of the Bronx .
For community , design and building , the process of building design is the design process .
Every single project , every year , it enabled young people to become the largest property and the biggest resources of our future .
We realized that <unk> <unk> , especially in its first year , is a little story of a story , two teachers , a project in the place .
But we think it 's in other places .
And I 'm deeply convinced that the power of this little story is , because if you have a charity in the world , it 's hard to do it .
Because , when you put the <unk> , you 're going to lose people like <unk> .
And finally , design is a job of working with us , and the people we want to help with our designers .
Let 's face it , designers , we need to fully <unk> ourselves .
We need to learn ourselves to work more , and we need a lot to do a better citizen .
So even though it 's just a very small story , we still hope that it can be a better future for the rural community to be better for public education , to try to design better futures for design .
Thank you .

<unk> <unk> on how to learn objects
In India , if you 're silent , you have two things to fight .
First opportunity is to have a little <unk> of healing , or <unk> , because in this country , most of them are focused on the health care hospital , and it 's only a few detail for health equipment .
In fact , even if you have a cure for healing , you do n't have the medical <unk> , which is this .
She 's a <unk> , only three - year - old stroke .
And so she came up with her village to the village , and she did n't have a lot of advice to <unk> , which allowed this girl to go into the normal hospital , who decided to get rid of the <unk> , and she said , " <unk> <unk> . "
And the news is , you know , what you 've learned is that if you 're for five or five years , it 's <unk> the brain to try to see things like the opportunity to look at things , and they do n't have opportunity .
And the reason for that is that there 's a lot of reasons why I 've got a lot of people in the background , and there 's a reason for that .
Let 's start with individuals .
<unk> normal , but I 'm very serious .
That 's my son , <unk> .
As a dad who had just been rejected as a father 's dad , I was a miracle of how tiny it was , which is a little bit smaller , and the responsibility for those of them as well as the responsibility for them .
I 'm going to tell you that when I was told that there were so many other kinds of <unk> that did n't have any healing , it was wrong .
That 's my personal reason .
In science , neuroscience has been a long time to think that when the brain is less than four or five years old , I 'm not agreeing with it because I do n't think so .
This theory comes from David <unk> and <unk> , and they 're the two scholars who have won Nobel Prize in 1981 , which is an extraordinary study of visual physics , but I believe that some of their jobs are growing into the base of the human population .
In fact , they 've done experiments with <unk> different types of variation in different sorts of <unk> , and these researchers are still being used to analyze our kids .
So I thought I needed to do two things .
First , kids provide <unk> kids .
This is <unk> <unk> .
The responsibility of science is to learn the limits to visual systems .
And obviously , there 's a lot of <unk> that goes around with each other .
So for a few years , I came up with a couple of years ago in the two years .
<unk> , you might know that in the Grand Canyon , we want to be able to bring the light to kids , and then there 's opportunity to make some kind of stuff .
And it 's a directory , although it looks like a lot of <unk> <unk> , which is the atmosphere of the Earth .
<unk> is focused on three areas , to help the kids who need to love and learn .
And now I 'm going to show you a clip of the two areas .
And the long - term intersection of this has led to the <unk> schools .
<unk> : Most of the kids are non - <unk> consultants : because it 's a monitor of a lot of kids who are looking at school .
This is the <unk> disease , and it 's called a permanent force .
This is a very extreme <unk> , called the eye .
Even so bad , we 're still going to have a little bit of a sense of vision , and it 's a very nice sign that suggests that there 's a certain amount of hope .
And so we put these things into the hospital , looking at the hospital .
We collaborated with this <unk> charity in Delhi .
It 's got a device that 's good for kids to look at the center of the <unk> , and thanks to <unk> McDonald 's .
You see , it 's much more useful .
<unk> : <unk> .
It helps us to look at those kids who are capable of looking at the eyes of the <unk> , and you 'll see what makes him blind .
And you see that this <unk> in the middle is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
We 're on the eyes of the eye , and it 's transparent , but this kid , his <unk> , does n't see it .
So this kid is getting treated and notice what he 's looking at .
This is the <unk> camera , and it 's on the glass glasses to replace it .
And the same kid , three weeks later , had three weeks later .
Thank you .
From that little video , you 've already learned that the healing is possible , and we 've been able to offer stories for more than 200 kids .
They 've got a lot of attention to these kids .
In fact , the same thing happened for the patient 's patient .
And a few years ago , we had a story about this woman on the right - hand side of the face , and she was starting to see her vision , she was very impressive in this <unk> .
It was a tragedy for the <unk> , two years ago , she died in the car accident .
She 's a real thing , and she does n't know what the future is , but it 's very encouraging .
When we start looking at this kind of stuff , you can imagine , in scientific and popular industries , there are several waves of <unk> .
This is a piece of paper that 's written in the " Nature " in Nature .
And we 're very upset about it , even if it 's a long - term vision .
And the next question is , how do you get to <unk> ?
We 're working on this : we 're going to start looking for a kid who 's sensitive to light .
To give him a sense of healing , I want to stress a little bit about this .
We have a lot of kids who are working on their work .
Every kid needs to be treated .
At the end of the day , almost every week , we give kids a simple visual test to look at their progress .
We try and do it .
This is the path of <unk> that we have never seen before .
What is the origin of the first development of development and what happens ?
We can learn a lot about different visual capacities , but I want to get one of these , which is how to <unk> the image .
See , you 're seeing a picture in the left , whether it 's the same thing , or the <unk> , which are the ones that are in small areas of the middle , and those little colors that have <unk> colors .
The brain uses it complex structures , and the smaller part of the small region enters the meaning of meaning , which tells us what is real , like you see in the right .
Nobody knows how this process is , and that 's the challenge we 're in <unk> .
This is actually a visual vision .
This man came up with this guy weeks ago , and this is <unk> <unk> , MIT , Stanford .
And his vision is <unk> , and you get a feeling that he 's going to get out of his head .
If you look at the real image or the early age of his experience , the <unk> of this image , they do n't notice that most of the stuff is <unk> , because the world goes into a lot of different colors , and there 's a whole bunch of colors and so on .
Same <unk> .
And when you ask them , you do n't have to name it , as you say , to the object .
And his world is very complex .
And even on top of the mouth , the shadow is <unk> .
Interestingly , several months later something happened .
E : A few things ?
<unk> : These are two objects .
E : What shapes ?
<unk> : They 're the shape .
This is the circle that is square .
Very dramatic transformation happened .
So what 's the problem ?
This is a very glamorous question , which is surprising to the answer .
And the answer comes from movement is the next video I want to show you .
<unk> : What can you see ?
<unk> : I do n't really know .
E : Now what ?
<unk> : <unk> .
E : A few things ?
Now , what do you have ?
patient : two .
E : What are these things ?
<unk> : A square and a circle .
This behavior goes over and over again .
<unk> systems explain the point that the world needs to vary information .
And what we 've got from this experiment is that there 's a lot of information that 's going to happen in the process of measuring information , and what 's called the <unk> process , which is <unk> the vision of visual effects , it allows the visual machinery to be visual senses .
It seems a little bit easier to think about this .
So let me just talk about two things about the other side of technology , the other thing .
So , from the perspective of engineering , we might say , well , it 's important to understand that dynamic is so important that the <unk> system is n't able to build the robot 's visual system , and it does n't need to use it .
That 's what we 're doing .
MIT is working on what 's going on here , where you 're learning anything you learned .
So what we 've done is we create a robot system that has a <unk> goal to get the vision of the visual input , and then <unk> it to the purpose of this vision .
Do n't worry about it .
I need to show you how we test her .
So the way to test it is to be able to put some information from it , so that babies can see , or whatever it can look like .
But for a long period of time , we did n't find that video .
So what I think is , well , it 's going to make my son when a baby 's a little baby camera .
We 're doing it .
And for this , I have to tell you a little bit about <unk> .
So , if you look at it , forgive me .
So we packaged cameras on the camera to replicate the visual precision .
You might know what 's going to happen to the older kids .
And their vision is -- we 're adults that are 20 or 20 babies per year , and so they see the world 's very , very dehumanizing world .
This is the baby cam saw this .
There is no audio on the screen .
What is amazing is that babies see the height of the world , and they can also see that the meaning of this type .
As soon as the child dies , baby will start to notice his cousin .
How does this happen ? We want to do this , and we can do it for motion .
To give it a video of this video , the video can start to <unk> patterns that contain patterns .
So this is a very important show that shows the importance of dynamic .
<unk> , it uses <unk> research from autism .
And the vision of visual generators starts to start with the <unk> of <unk> , some scientists in research .
And what we see here is the synthesis of the visual system of visual systems that wo n't be a kind of <unk> , but <unk> dynamic <unk> .
Because if this <unk> is really a huge amount of impact on our research , especially different autism .
And what you 're seeing here is two kids , a normal <unk> child , playing playing games .
So , when kids are playing , we 're tracking them .
The red is the road movement .
This is normal kids , you see the dynamic of this kid , and you 'll see where the ball is .
And before you go to the sphere , you can see it there .
Instead , another <unk> kid plays playing .
They ca n't predict the movement of his mouth .
It 's the efficiency of <unk> information .
We 've always been trying to do that in the same day , and there 's a lot of research to report .
And to look at it , if you think that this circle represents all the kids that we 've already chosen , it 's the ratio of the problem .
The red dots are our <unk> kids .
So there 's a lot of kids , and so many of the kids who need to get involved in the scale of <unk> , we 're planning to develop a school - based school center , where we think about the schools , the <unk> and the future of childhood .
<unk> <unk> is going to merge with health education and science for a really great great power for it .
In the course of five years , it 's been affecting the <unk> of <unk> , from the foundations of the fundamental neuroscience and legitimacy , for example , <unk> - <unk> <unk> robots , which is the most important thing to learn about the kids who are blind children who have blind pain .
And for my students , it 's a remarkable experience for me , because we 're doing very interesting research at the same time , and we 've got a lot of work with kids .
Thank you very much .

Amy <unk> on running
<unk> : Amy and I thought -- ♫ Hi , Amy . Amy : Hey .
<unk> : Amy and I just communicate a few days later , I want to tell you all of what makes her separate .
E : Yeah , if you 've seen my photographs in my face , it might have been told to say something about it . I 'm born on the left .
When I was a year , I had been rejected since I did it .
<unk> : Well , you can tell you , well , how do you get to <unk> ?
Let 's start out there .
E : I 'm a student - <unk> student .
Yves <unk> won the <unk> .
They 've got hundreds of students per year in the country , and they 're going to get them all over the place , I 've won all the opportunity to <unk> the opportunity . I 've been there for four years .
<unk> : At that point , she thinks she 's a little bit curious about <unk> , and she decided to call people a <unk> .
So , you 've got to say that story .
Amy : All right . I guess I always love movement .
I had five years old .
And in high school , it 's been skiing up at the University of <unk> , and I started a little bit more <unk> because I had no intention of movement .
And I did n't have the competition from a football game . I always played with those physical <unk> .
I just know that .
In fact , I 've been going to see someone else who 's going to see other people .
And I heard , you know , there 's also a <unk> for the <unk> of disability , and I think , oh , I do n't really understand this competition , but I 'm trying to see it before it 's going on .
And so 95 years later , I <unk> my own <unk> for Boston , and I was 19 years old ; I did n't have it . I 've never done it before .
And a few weeks later , I took a <unk> path to try and figure out how much they could run .
And in that time , my legs are using a kind of wood and a plastic mask , and using nylon glasses , with the <unk> glasses -- big and big , <unk> <unk> -- you know , that 's not too glamorous .
And then I went to Boston , and I had a whole bunch of <unk> <unk> all sorts of black holes -- and you know , there 's all kinds of things that they 're looking at , they look at me , that we know who ca n't win .
And I said , I 've got to go there -- I do n't know what I 'm expecting -- but , you know , when I see a little girl who is losing the leg , she 's got six inches of sleeping , and it 's about five inches -- <unk> , <unk> feet .
<unk> <unk> takes five feet in Bangalore , and I mean , this can give you a better -- a lot of <unk> in the world , even though they look at the conditions of the <unk> .
So I decided to go to <unk> , and you know , my heart of my life was my first risk , which brought me to the first time that I was trying to make a new <unk> for three or three years old .
And people say , " Hey , you know what you 're going to do -- you 've got the speed of <unk> -- but you do n't know how to run the skill and strategy .
You 're very optimistic .
We see how hard it is .
So I decided to call my <unk> <unk> .
Thank God I did n't know what he was in this area .
And when he came to his <unk> <unk> , and you know , this person comes from the floor to the <unk> of the United States . And you can imagine , all the votes he had .
It 's a new number .
I gave him the telephone , and I said , " Listen , I 've got a running player . I win .
And I want to see you can not , you know -- I think you ca n't get your training , look at what you 're doing . "
I just want -- twice , twice .
Can I sit there and see what you 're doing ?
And then he said , " Well , that 's what we 're trying to do before we decide before . "
And he was thinking , " What do I do with myself ? "
So I went to see the coach , and I walked into his offices and saw the prayers of the <unk> who had been trained .
We sit down , we 're going to talk about it , and we 've done a fantastic job of cooperation because he has never taken the idea of disability , <unk> his ability to <unk> , but I never had a professional psychic .
So it 's all like , well , we start writing a new journey .
So the next week , he trained me to train me , completely in his <unk> , and I went to the runway and with him .
That 's how I met <unk> <unk> .
But in the fall of ' 95 , the winter time in winter , he said , " You know , you 've got enough .
You can get the women here . " <unk> .
I said , " <unk> , please . "
And he said , " No , I 'm really sure you can do it .
You get trained with our women . "
So in 1996 , I created the project for the National <unk> Foundation , and I came up with the <unk> of <unk> . And then I came up with women .
There 's never been been done before , and it 's been participating in universities .
So it 's all starting to become an amazing combination .
<unk> : Well , you do n't have to tell you that you 're going to talk to you about the way you go into the <unk> .
Tell you ?
E : Ooh , yeah , yes , you know , I 've got all of these consultants , but in the middle of the <unk> , when I know that they have to adapt to the other , they 're looking at me -- and you 're going to do it in front of me , and that 's what it is -- it 's -- I 'm doing it .
At the time of my <unk> , I was there , thinking about how to grow -- and I 've been the best part of the country -- but you know , you have to engage with those people who are dancing than you .
And so I 'd like to leave you with the " <unk> <unk> , " which is the same kind of play .
And that was very , very hot .
And that was the first time -- from the 17th - year anniversary of the museum , I was just covered with a nice leg -- I did n't realize the separation of flow in the <unk> , and I 'd like to do it in <unk> .
100 meters of <unk> , and when I left my face , my leg got rid of my legs .
It <unk> down , and it 's about 5,000 people .
I do n't feel bad , but I 've got 200 meters of chess , and I 'm going to start a half a hour .
I went to <unk> , and I said , " Hey , do n't let me go . "
I ca n't wait for all the audiences in front of the audience .
If it 's in <unk> <unk> , I ca n't do 200 meters .
That 's why <unk> sit there .
My plea is <unk> . Thank you .
Because he was like -- you know , he 's Brooklyn -- it 's a big -- he says , " Amy , if your leg goes down and how ?
You 've got to pick up the <unk> , and go back and run this damn match . "
I did . So it was like , he 's going to stay in the <unk> .
Let me stay in the <unk> .
<unk> : So , Amy , <unk> , she was very excited . She was a lot of her family . That big event .
Now she 's -- you 've got two years , right ?
E : No , no year .
<unk> : One year . That 's what you 'll tell you about the game .
Amy : Okay . Well , Atlanta . <unk> .
<unk> , which is the <unk> of the people who have a body <unk> -- the dog , who has the brain , has a brain mating -- and the opposite of a special <unk> for Chile .
So , one week later , we arrived in Atlanta , and I was shocked , you know , I 've been running down a year , but 50 meters ago .
Now , I 'm here -- a <unk> .
I did n't have the American record -- in <unk> , in the <unk> -- and you know , I 'm holding it back to the truth , and it 's going to go home .
And I also was the only one who was called <unk> <unk> .
I was only the only advocate of <unk> <unk> .
I did n't have a damn guy who came to me and said , " How do you do that ? We should all be flat , so it ca n't be released . "
And I said , " Well , I just did n't have it anymore . Nobody said no . "
This is funny -- <unk> <unk> , three inches -- I 've been doing it , and I 'm going to show you , <unk> ?
No , I 've got <unk> and 100 meters .
<unk> .
I was on the front page of my house , and I had six years old .
And that was like , finally , until I was <unk> .
And we were trained at the <unk> of <unk> -- a couple of miles away from the Pentagon .
And I was in the legs -- I could now put them out of the world . I 'm the first one .
I 'm like a little leopard -- I 'll tell you this , just like it 's doing it .
All the cameras looked at me : " What is the girl doing ? "
And I went around and I thought , where am I stalling ?
That was the first time I had ever spent international meditation .
I want to use everybody to do that , and you know what I 'm going to learn with you ?
" Oh , Amy , we 'll tell you . "
I want to know when .

Now , I started playing at the Olympic Library of Congress . They 've got the <unk> <unk> . I went to see the past .
My best job , and also <unk> , is <unk> seconds .
I saw the next line , <unk> , which is <unk> seconds .
And the phone is <unk> , and it 's <unk> . I said , " This is what 's going on ? "
And then they took us to <unk> the bus , and all of the women on the top have a hand .
And then I went , and I was like -- all of them look at me , like looking at the <unk> , you know ?
And I sat there , and I thought , " Oh , my God , oh boy . "
I never had to lose it before , whether it 's a pottery or , you know , skiing , I 've got five years , whatever I always do .
It 's great in the experience of <unk> .
Even though I did n't always tell you , it 's the best training training , which is training .
We <unk> Atlanta , we 're like an elite community now , and I 'm going to lose away .
And I thought , " Oh my God , my whole entire family sat down from the lawn . "
And I 'm involved in the only United States of this race .
So they came up with my name , and I said , " Ladies and gentlemen . "
When I finally woke up my leg , I feel bad , because I hear someone in the room like they 're going to stare at me .
I feel like , " I know ! Go on . I 'm going to look at it .
I know that I 'm just going to last the last card , and you know , if I do n't get rid of that girl , you 've got to give them a <unk> .
I mean , that 's exactly what I was talking about for the rest of the month -- the naive , <unk> , the <unk> -- all <unk> .
And when <unk> folded <unk> , the only thing I could remember was that the last thing happened , and you could understand it , trying to get rid of the stomach , it 's unbelievable that it was completely <unk> .
I have to know why you do this , you know .
What if I first , what 's the first thing to do ?
All these training , completely changed my life .
I became university student , and then I was <unk> .
All the things that really made me feel like I 'm going to end .
And the truth is that I did n't just have the goal of the Olympics at the end of a year , and since my life 's life , I had a lot of <unk> in this orbit , looking at where the limits of my own forces are in the orbit . Right ?
And I did have <unk> -- well , how much could it have to have a <unk> ?
How many people would pay their time , their expertise and their patient ?
This is like a collective dancer -- in my back , 50 people involved in this incredible Atlanta journey .
I want to say , I 'm going to do anything like this , for example , to sit down and sit in this way , and think about how much it is to go to this goal .
And the goal , I think , is very important , and I also realized that in the process of finding yourself as a person .
That 's a successful success , really successful .
<unk> : Why do n't you look at your legs ?
E : Ooh , no problem .
<unk> : Let 's see not only the pig 's arm .
E : Okay , that 's my beautiful leg .
No , they 're really <unk> legs . They are really beautiful .
You have to be careful about them .
And there 's even a little bit over there , and I 'm also going to give myself a <unk> .
Seriously , but I can also wear <unk> <unk> .
And that feeling that you may not feel , it 's going to go into the car , buy any pair of shoes that you want to enjoy in .
<unk> : You can determine your height ?
E : Yes , I think much higher .
Yves <unk> , the <unk> of the 80s , came back in summer .
I kept staring at him in <unk> , because his foot broke off .
I said , " Get it out , do n't worry .
And you have eight feet tall , and you get them out . "
But unfortunately , he does n't think it 's funny .
Well , these are the ones that I 've got my legs , with carbon <unk> , and I said , I 'm going to make sure that every time I make it right .
Oh , I have this <unk> .
These are -- you can take a hand ?
This one , this is what I used to do with <unk> and play .
It 's <unk> , and when you 're wearing this circle , it 's going to <unk> the sound of the circle , and it 's okay . OK .
And I 'm just going to <unk> this little piece of <unk> in my leg , and when I sweat , they might get out of the way .
<unk> : Are you happy ?
E : You 're a man ?
<unk> : Yeah .
E : I do n't know . I 'm not sure .
Maybe not a little bit ? I can put it all up .
<unk> : She ca n't stand in this glamorous , she has to walk . So ...
E : Yeah , I have to walk away . And it 's a bit of a art .
If you do n't have this leopard <unk> , I 'm going to try and put my leg on them .
So , I 'm wearing them . I 've got half the world .
These are the real qualities of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the <unk> , it 's the only place that they 're looking at when they look at the underside of the Grand Canyon , where they 're <unk> <unk> .
So when I wear these legs , my legs are <unk> and <unk> with the muscle , like if I have a foot on my own feet .
Amy : That 's a company in San Diego called <unk> - <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> , and I hope that it 's going to continue to continue to be <unk> .
And I said , well , it 's all very surprising .
I need new products because you 've got to , you know , that 's -- back to the beginning .
<unk> : Boys and their designers are going to tell us about the design process .
Amy : Yeah .
<unk> : Yeah , very excited .
Amy : Well , these are the tuned legs , and I can <unk> my other ...
<unk> : Can you say , who designed other legs ?
<unk> : And of course , these are the ones that I 've taken in England in the U.K. , in London , about two hours per hour , and I 'm the only one who has the one person who is , they 're really beautiful .
<unk> , because these are the toes of these toes .
For me , I 'm looking at the <unk> <unk> , but it 's a very important way to do it , and I think that 's important .
I mean , I 'm happy to do that for free , to choose the shoes , the <unk> , that I hope they can serve more people in the future .
These are also <unk> .
And here 's very basic , primitive <unk> .
It 's like the leg .
That 's true . It 's embedded in this position , so I have to wear two inches taller .
I really think -- let me just close it down to you .
I do n't know how you think it is , but they 're really great .
There 's even <unk> blood pressure , and my <unk> is pink , like you can see , but it 's still <unk> .
Really magic . I 've got them for two weeks a year .
They 're like a skin skin .
It 's a two years ago , a <unk> said , my God , if I could go to <unk> <unk> , to see the color of the eye , and even the skin color , it seemed to be the same -- and why we ca n't build a prosthetic arm , or a leg or the hand ?
And then they created the audiences .
They used to create something spectacular .
<unk> : Two weeks ago , Amy went to <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
She went to <unk> , and she said , " I have to buy some <unk> ! "
This is about a hour of <unk> , and she thinks that <unk> <unk> Bush , but actually it 's a three - inch seat .
E : That makes me bad , because it means my whole night .
<unk> : We 've found <unk> , fortunately <unk> .
They sent them to the shoes .
Chris Anderson : I said to the late ' 80s , I 'm very upset that I was in the next day , and he said , " Listen , you 've got to help me give me a little bit .
Because I 'm going to meet you now . " One , first , they 're <unk> , that 's , if you do n't like your shoes , you 're sorry .
" No , no . I 'm a little bit special , so I need a couple of inches of high - speed high heels .
I have to make it happen . "
But they do n't even want to go .
They did n't want to touch the shoes , they did it .
No , these legs are really good .
I was ready for a couple of weeks to go back to them .
I want to look at the legs , and so I can put it in <unk> , and now it 's not so difficult .
So -- <unk> : It 's a time .
<unk> : This is <unk> <unk> .

Rob <unk> : The iPod of 80 billion dollars
It 's recently <unk> the <unk> of the United States in the last century , <unk> , and Europe , which is <unk> <unk> .
And I think that the data that comes out of the physical , <unk> , is really helping <unk> .
So , I want to say that we 're going to do this in the realm of the future : <unk> copyright laws , if you want to talk about it .
For example , in the recent <unk> of the last year , we have a hundred billion dollars a year .
And instead of arguing about this number , copyright mathematicians will analyze this figures soon , and he 's going to realize that the money will go from the ocean to <unk> -- and go to Mars .
And of course , if we take a pair of money to <unk> the money .
Now , look at this , obviously , this is a very powerful guy , even a strong <unk> .
But this is also an important statement of morality .
Because this is not something that we often refer to , the <unk> of the film , but it 's real real estate .
This is the amount of loss in the entire U.S. corn , and all of our fruit crops still have <unk> , <unk> and <unk> -- what we 're missing is that we lose <unk> .
But it 's almost impossible to measure the economy , but unless we use the laws of copyright laws .
Since the <unk> of <unk> , the revenues of the music emerged every year , 80 billion dollars per year .
So this is what we 're looking at .
But the revenues from the entire sector are owned by theater , including the <unk> , the car , and buy the TV .
There 's also a lot of money to the TV , and the revenues and the cable .
Other ones spread in markets , like books and radio tickets .
So it 's a very <unk> one .
And since the main content of the market is spreading through the past the last standards , it does n't stop them , but the laws of copyright mathematical laws tell us that it 's because there 's a marketplace in the ' 90s , which is not happening in a market where there is no exaggeration in this market .
What we 're seeing here is the potential cost of the telephone .
And 500 billion dollars a year , this is a lot of <unk> , and a 30 seconds can go from the <unk> .
This is true .
I have <unk> <unk> .
The people who are telling us that we have more than 37 , 95 percent of the workplace are spreading from the content , and if you put this numbers out in 1998 , it 's a lot of American labor that says , <unk> and videos have been funded by the United States .
The other data shows that music industries are about 40,000 , 5,000 people .
And as the legacy of the Internet , the <unk> and all the concepts of all of us are traveling to our content .
And this is one of the most respected <unk> of all the copyright makers that make these data available every day .
Some people think that the <unk> theory are hard .
This is one of the key figures between copyright makers .
It 's the opposite of a song or a film , and it makes a difference to a media company .
Hollywood and Congress are talking about a number of times when we 're going to lose this digital <unk> and foundation .
Some people think that this number is very glamorous , but the copyright expert in the <unk> expert is just surprised why the numbers do n't grow <unk> .
In this law , the most powerful MP3 player in the world is only 10 song .
And it 's Christmas .
Because the <unk> is n't going to take a <unk> worth of value in your pocket .
Now , a iPod <unk> <unk> can save four , <unk> song , which is equivalent to the <unk> of 80 billion dollars .
That 's equivalent to seven jobs .
Maybe , you know , the laws of copyright math are weird , but that 's because it 's an area of experts who do research research .
And I 'll talk about that .
And I hope , next time , when I 'm going to get to the end of the United States , it 's a relatively scientific event for the American economy , and you have to hear me told me about it .
Thank you so much .
Thank you .
<unk>
From the rockets to the market , most of the most amazing civilization of human society is in the world , and why the kids will lose mathematics ? So , <unk> <unk> argues that the curriculum is not going to be <unk> , but it 's not only about what we 're looking at . In this talk , he does n't have to do something about it .

<unk> <unk> : How to teach kids real mathematical math
Our math is actually true today .
No one is really happy .
All of the mathematics to learn about mathematics is that the knowledge of learning is not , boring and rare .
And the people who used to think about the mathematics they learned not enough .
Governments know that this is a big problem with our economy , but they 're not going to do it .
The teachers are also frustrated .
But now the mathematics for any time in the history of human history .
One of the things we 've lost about math is , on the other hand , our world is even more mathematical than the mathematics , the <unk> world .
So the question is , why do you do this ? How do we solve this problem ?
I think the answer is in our face , using computers .
And I think it 's a <unk> <unk> that makes math education to work .
In explaining , let me briefly briefly show you the math and our math in the world .
In reality , math is not a mathematician .
<unk> , engineers , biologists tend to use math , <unk> and <unk> .
The use of mathematics is actually quite widespread .
But in the mathematics of teaching , it 's completely different -- it has a lot of stupid problems , lots of <unk> -- mostly <unk> .
A lot of it seems to be very simple , the complexity of the world , in the process of learning .
And the other thing about math is that the math seems to be " mathematical " like this -- but sometimes it 's not like -- " <unk> <unk> ? "
You get a solution to the real world .
A few years ago , you ca n't expect the answer to that .
But now you can understand -- sorry my weight is much better than this , but -- understanding what 's happening .
And we come back and see , why do we get math ?
What does it mean to teach mathematics ?
And especially , why are we going to use math as a railway station ?
Why is math in a important part of education ? Why do you want to think as a <unk> ?
And I think this is probably about three reasons : one of the things that 's done with technology is that it 's really important for the development of our economy , which is what I call my life . Two , two , you have to have more information for a few years , and you 've got to go to the world more than a couple of years .
This is a couple of years of trying to make social work and think about it , and it 's going to be part of the human society .
It needs to be the important tool for the mathematics to make this idea .
Let 's think about another problem .
What is the mathematics ?
And when we say we 're doing math , or are we teaching mathematics ?
In general , I think there are four steps , right ?
What 's the question we want to ask ? What are we thinking about ?
The most easy step in the world is the easiest step on the outside world .
And if people do n't get the problem , there 's no reason they 're going to get wrong , if you 're not wrong .
Next is based on the right questions . Put it from the reality of the world .
This is the second step .
And then we went into the third stage .
<unk> is a answer to a mathematical form .
And of course , math is very useful in this one .
And finally , it 's going to transform the problems of the real world .
How do you solve real social problems ?
And of course , it 's also the beginning .
Now , this crazy thing is crazy .
In the mathematics of mathematics , we 've spent a lot of time teaching people to <unk> the third stage .
Yet , this is a better step of people who are doing a lot better than anyone ever attempted .
<unk> , we should be able to do this with the computer three , and let 's spend a lot more .
Do you see ? The point here is that mathematics is not equivalent to computation .
The mathematics is more <unk> than the computation .
Now we 're going to come up with the reason why we have the calculations and the math for a hundred years .
The only way we do it is to do that .
It 's just a fundamental change in the last few decades .
Computers used to make the biggest change in the old <unk> .
The calculations are usually the <unk> of <unk> , and it 's not uncommon .
So , I think , well , math has come from computational .
But the mathematics is still not introduced to the teaching .
I think , in some way , computation is just <unk> mathematics .
The engine is a <unk> .
That 's what you want to do , and you can do it .
It 's just a way to use purpose , rather than purpose .
Computers allow us to do this , and this is not a problem .
And I think it 's only about the world that we 're going to spend about 20 years of life to teach people to do <unk> <unk> .
This is a huge human labor .
So the best way to be really clear -- in the way , most people do n't feel a lot of fun . So , we can do it very well that we know what this is doing , so it 's a real purpose .
I think we should expect computers to achieve <unk> , just to teach people to <unk> <unk> .
I think some of the situation .
For example , try to do it .
I still use a lot of time in terms of trying to use it , usually .
And when others say , this is true .
And I would say , well , it 's not obvious . I think that 's probably true .
It 's still a quicker way to think about it .
So I think that <unk> is something that teaches <unk> <unk> .
There are also some of the concepts that come from the idea of <unk> <unk> , but it 's almost a little bit smaller .
For example , I 'm often asked to do a analogy for the ancient Greeks .
We 're always teaching students to learn mathematics .
It 's a <unk> .
And what I 've never been talking about is , I have never suggested that if someone 's interested in artificial <unk> or in their own desire , they 're supposed to do it .
Because people develop their own signature , and it 's exactly the right thing .
I personally have a special attitude to the ancient Greeks , but I do n't think we need to force people like the Republican <unk> .
I do n't think that 's worth it .
So I know that we need to differentiate people to learn whether they 're going to be in a certain way , or something like that , and even the <unk> of the subject , or even the <unk> of the subject of that .
So why do people ask this ?
One of the things they say , you have to have a good job .
You do n't use the foundation of the curriculum , before you 're completely <unk> .
And so the question that I normally ask is , what is the origin of what you say ?
What 's the foundation ?
So what do you do about the foundation of the car ?
What is the origin of the writing ?
I do n't think so .
I think you need to be able to understand what you 're going to do to get into two components of how you get outcomes and how to fold it .
In <unk> , if you 're not sure you need to know that some of the cars and the downs of a hundred years of work , it 's a lot of work .
But the purpose of the car is <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , which means that cars are relative to the transportation sector , and the other thing is , the same thing .
That 's what drives it to the <unk> , not only in the case of the car , because I believe that <unk> will be able to do the same work on the future .
<unk> can be able to use more practical people to spread .
Another idea about <unk> .
And I think people <unk> tools to use tools in teaching these tools .
It 's not because they 're invented by the computer , and people need to use paper and use ink to teach the mathematics that math does n't necessarily necessarily represent the mathematical structure .
And the story of my daughter is something that makes a difference .
She loves her " <unk> Laptop Laptop . "
And I asked her one day , and I said , " I 'm not going to do this .
Do you think that 's why ? "
And she was very careful about her , and she said , " No paper ? "
And if you 're born in computer and paper , you learn math , and it 's not really important to learn about the computers , but you just have to use the best tools to study math .
The other point is that the computer makes math . "
And in a certain sense , if you use computers , it 's just the buttons that do n't have to think about it , but you 're not doing artificial <unk> , which is very intellectual .
I 'm going to say , well , this is very tough .
Do we really think that it 's much more important than the mathematics to learn in schools ? They 're still doing a lot of problems that they do n't understand .
At least I think .
Even more serious , what they learned was that knowledge in school was no longer useful .
Maybe 50 years ago , we 're not using it yet .
They use computers to do their computers .
To <unk> , the computers have completely solved this problem , actually , to understand it more easily .
And now , as any great tool they can do , they 're completely <unk> , like anything that 's going to be made into a multimedia hole like this , and the computer is like the <unk> of the teacher -- it 's like a teacher .
It 's really ridiculous .
Why do we need to use the computer to show you how to <unk> <unk> ? Well , computer computing can do it .
It 's all back .
So let me show you how the computer interface works .
And usually in school , you learn <unk> <unk> .
But if you use computers to do it , you just have to do something .
It becomes a four - dimensional equations that are more complex .
Same principles , but it 's just a bit more complex .
In reality , the problem in the world is like this complex and challenging .
Even more <unk> problem .
These are n't simple texts that we teach mathematics .
Let 's think about the world .
Do we really think that engineering and biology , the math of the computer and the mathematics of <unk> , is because it 's clearly <unk> in some way ?
I think it 's opposite .
The real problem in the mathematics of mathematics is not the computers that make math , but we 're teaching the question that our students are stupid .
Well , the other thing that people say is that <unk> <unk> , in some sense , can teach students to understand math .
So if you 've done a lot of <unk> , you can be able to figure out the foundation of the mathematical system .
And I think there 's a little bit of that , and I 'm very sure that I do n't think it 's so important that I think it 's important .
But in modern society we have a great way to do this .
That 's the programming .
Now most of the programming processes that vary in programming , it 's also a good way to encourage students to inspire the students , to test them whether they really understand math .
If you really want to test the mathematics , the math tries to write a program .
So I think programming is what we should do .
Namely , I want to say that programming provides a unique opportunity : the one that makes math more practical , and the other side is more <unk> .
And I think that this new thing about the mathematical curriculum is not yet there .
This is usually the <unk> of a <unk> or an intellectual <unk> .
But I want to use computer computers to do two things .
And we have a lot of possibilities for us .
We can solve more facts .
And I really feel that this kind of educational reform can get a lot of knowledge and experience , much more <unk> than ever before .
And with more complex themes -- the <unk> of mathematics , and the math of math , feeling math .
We want to feel that the students can be <unk> .
And that 's exactly what computers do .
The other thing is that computers make us <unk> to teach our curriculum .
That 's the sequence of the <unk> curriculum , which is the order of <unk> classes , but now we can re - <unk> the idea of ideas , regardless of the urgency .
So calculus is very late to teach .
Why is it that ?
And the problem is that openness is very crucial .
But in fact , a lot of the concepts can be taught to teach more than <unk> .
This is a prototype for my daughter <unk> .
And it 's very simple .
This model is to be able to understand when the <unk> is increasing , and the change changes , the pattern changes .
Of course , Bosch becomes a circle .
And by the way , she 's a particularly important trait that shows her color , and this is a very important feature for this show .
And you can see that this is a very <unk> <unk> and an architect , which allows you to look at the changes of the limits of your limits to the limit .
<unk> examples .
This is a way of looking at the world , usually after a long time , to teach the students .
But it 's a very important and practical observation .
And that 's what we 're going to have to reform that process , right ?
And finally , if we take a step of the <unk> <unk> , it 's not going to be able to make the current economic change in education .
And as important as an important reason to use computers is also important .
And so we can use real problems for example , like , " Which kind of <unk> is more appropriate for us ? "
And you can see that this is not the <unk> problem .
This is actually a real model we can use to optimize .
How many years ?
What do you do about the <unk> ?
And I do n't have a single problem here , which is the only problem that I 'm going to find in the test , but I think at least this is a very important pattern , it 's a completely important thing , and it 's the understanding of the fact that people understand it .
So I believe that we need a change in the developed world as an math .
We 're trying to ensure that making sure that they can feel mathematical , we can transform economic growth and social progress .
That 's not the way that you go through the <unk> .
And I think that the state of the country has to be <unk> , even bigger , more sustainable economic systems , and more glamorous countries .
In fact , I 'm even going to say that we 're all talking about the era of " <unk> " era , which is called " computers ' <unk> , " and it 's a high - tech science for each person .
We can make more students into this reform , allowing them to get this kind of education .
We need to understand that this is not an inclusive reform .
We 're going to try to move through the schools between schools and actual math systems .
And you can see that if we come out of this gap , we 're going to end up <unk> , even better than ever .
That 's not what I want to say , and I think we should skip , we have to accelerate the speed of our <unk> speed , so we 're going to be able to get a little bit higher from it , of course , to calculate it .
So what I want to see here is a whole new , dynamic curriculum curriculum in the form of the computer , and it 's all very common .
<unk> tools , we believe it will be completely covered in every place .
Now I do n't know whether we should still be the name of mathematics , but I 'm sure that the lesson of the class is the dominant mainstream .
Let 's try it . And in learning all of you , most of the students and the TED audience enjoy some fun .
Thank you .
<unk>
In this talk , the <unk> of the film , " <unk> <unk> , John <unk> examines the camera in the movie , and <unk> the lights on the screen , <unk> his eyes , using <unk> to the Web -- and so forth ?
computers , design , interface , invention , technology , visualizations
<unk>
John <unk> demos the user user interface
<unk> is about 25 , 26 years ago , that 's the amazing innovation in <unk> , even on the whole computer .
It fundamentally changed the way people understand the pattern of computing and how to use the computer , to make a difference .
That 's a very completely folded change , actually , in the early days of <unk> , who had had a whole new operating system in ' <unk> .
So now , I want to <unk> a interesting lesson , or a lesson that 's been forgotten from <unk> : the operating system is the Internet itself .
The interface is actually the operating system .
And this is like the interior of " <unk> " and the king , the <unk> , all the other ones .
A new operating system is n't a convenience thing .
It 's not just about changing and changing some patterns that are <unk> and <unk> .
There was no pattern on the process , and there was no mouse .
So that 's the only choice that <unk> the operating system .
But in the <unk> 25 years , we saw all sorts of basic technologies .
So , for example , <unk> and <unk> have reached about one to 10,000 .
<unk> speed .
And the Internet , at the end of the Web , did n't have the network , and now it 's the most <unk> thing we live in in our lives .
And of course , the power of <unk> : now you spend a hundred dollars in the grocery store to buy a million dollars more than 10 years ago , more <unk> <unk> .
Well , our technology has got incredible development .
And then , on the other hand , we have the Internet , and more <unk> service , which is very good , but the things that are <unk> in the <unk> , it 's also an <unk> factor .
<unk> us to create new interfaces .
And of course , in the recent decades , we 've seen a lot of changes that people already start with .
So what 's going to happen next ? What 's the origin of the brain ?
And we think that the challenge of this is to say , " <unk> , space , or a simple <unk> : " The geometric shape . "
Computers and our ability to communicate with communication , when we 're dealing with space , as well as it comes to space .
They ca n't understand the space of reality .
<unk> is a fun thing , because all of us are very upset with it .
And they do n't understand time , but it 's another idea of the other .
So what if you start explaining space ?
You might have a <unk> room like light .
This is a system that looks like a space that takes place as an input and an <unk> system .
This is actually a very simple concept , but it 's not <unk> .
You see , when you 're mouse , your hand is on this place .
And even the same kind of thing that you 're going to talk about , the <unk> display on the <unk> monitor .
So this room , all of the walls , in the floor , and the ceiling , the <unk> , their prey , <unk> plants , does n't just show it , but it can feel .
That means that it 's going to be in the same space , and you can do something like this .
This is a fact that there 's a plate of electric ice .
It will be the same thing as the real world of the world .
No matter what you 're going to get out of it .
This is a little bit of an experiment that 's going to be done with some other interesting things .
If you give it a climb , it will try to figure out what you might expect .
If you look at the wall , these signs are <unk> , and it 's a little bit boring .
And the strategy of this research thinks it 's too bad for it , so we 've done some very serious techniques like this , such as this ceiling , and putting it on a piece of paper .
Using the actual physical <unk> and the lens , this system is moving out of the direction of the laser light path .
So the interface actually says that there 's no interface .
And you 're doing this thing with you in the real world , which means , using your hand directly .
Similarly , this is a digital submarine , and digital winds come from the bottom of the face to the left , which is not glamorous , because we do n't invent this stuff .
But if you put it on stage or <unk> , then you have one thing , a reality , it does n't have any meaning .
And here , the reality of the world is embedded together .
And finally , we put all the elements together , and we made this <unk> system with the towns of town , which provided the architect and the cities of the city .
They have a more friendly interface for them .
And it goes down to the keyhole , like this .
If you get some tools like this , you can simulate the sun .
This is eight in the morning .
At nine o'clock in the morning .
Again , you can start to rotate the sun again .
<unk> , even shorter .
We 've done a whole bunch of tools .
There are kids who are going to interact with the <unk> , and even if they do n't know anything about the city , it 's about to move on a building .
And using a stick to touch this building , it 's like <unk> <unk> buildings .
Would n't it feel like a lot of <unk> on the corner of the corner ?
<unk> tools can be connected to the larger ones .
Take a look at the risk of the <unk> Empire , and so on .
Now if you look at these ideas , or even a little bit <unk> , good , you 've heard about those things .
This job is 15 years ago .
This is the <unk> of the MIT Media Lab in MIT , and he 's also the founder of physical media and <unk> .
The World Peace Organization , <unk> <unk> , saw this job .
But <unk> was going to be a little bit of a very challenging film for <unk> <unk> , called " <unk> articles , " and he came up with the design of the MIT video .
And the great thing about this thing is that <unk> is so good for the <unk> , which is <unk> in the ' <unk> of the film , and he gives us the design of his design .
It turns out that it 's great to leave people with long - term meals .
When you 're talking about new user design , people are also saying that these sequences are in " marble reports . "
And the thing that makes us think about this kind of stuff is that we think that it 's the end of the night , we call that space handling system .
We have a bunch of things , some images .
With a hand - hand hand , we can calculate the power of <unk> , six - <unk> .
Now , the eyes of the <unk> <unk> , a little bit .
From that awful Nick <unk> .
That 's the climb .
Now we 're doing a little bit harder .
We have a whole bunch of <unk> .
We can do it in the middle .
So control is a fundamental problem .
You have to be able to get into three dimensions .
Most of the things we need to have computers to help be the nature of space .
And those are n't the kinds of spaces that allow us to understand that our brain can be easily understood .
And if you look at this , we can do this in many different ways .
It 's just like this . They 're <unk> them .
We can fold it down .
And of course , the interface is n't just answering the same important thing .
So , if you do n't like what we do , or we 're very curious about <unk> <unk> , we can <unk> them .
And if you have to figure out what we 're going to do that , we 're going to zoom in a little bit .
We come up with a little bit of that .
This is another different way of seeing things .
And if you want to get further and further research , you might probably think about this .
So now we 've <unk> these things into color .
Now , if we want to take things from three - dimensional space -- in fact , it 's very important to monitor the motions of the hand , because that 's really important because we 're able to do it in the real three or two degrees of space .
Here 's some options .
And what we 're going to show you now is to actually find the yellow and the green <unk> in the green grass .
Now , we 're going to show some values .
This is a <unk> system where we 're now doing a little project right now .
There are many facets .
One of the most important things about this is to combine the data between traditional forms and three - dimensional <unk> .
This is where we 're familiar .
Let 's zoom out a little bit .
It 's just a little bit about us .
Take this picture .
So what we 're going to do is we can actually go into this .
These are the components of <unk> systems around the U.S.
A three - dimensional interacting with the idea of the architect and the <unk> of computing and <unk> .
That 's the way that <unk> and <unk> , right , one machine , a mouse , an mouse .
Obviously , this is n't true .
Because in reality , we have to cooperate , and we need a lot of different kinds of views .
Now look at these different images .
This process is going to be <unk> .
And the person who came up there was sit there , and I got this thing from here .
These machines are <unk> , you know .
So the calculations here are <unk> with space and networks .
I 'm going to stay there because I have a question to ask Paul .
Paul is this art designer , and maybe let him go here and tell me that it 's the easiest position .
So I 'm going to move these things out .
And now you squeeze it , and keep it up .
<unk> : Are you going to make it work ?
Let me see if you can help find the <unk> .
You know , it looks like a lot of <unk> demos , and we 're always doing that in the lab .
Okay .
So , <unk> is really important , regardless of the same space , and the distance is very different .
Again , these things require to operate in space .
And finally , I want to talk to you about the world .
This system is called " <unk> , " which is a little bit closer to the future , trying to see what the future is doing .
And as a member of the company , we believe that we should be able to use more exquisite and <unk> media .
So there 's a huge film on this .
Now we 're going to take something from inside .
We can actually zoom in the past .
Put it in the top of the box , and there 's a layer where they 're going to get rid of the table , and now it gets into this table .
And then we went to Jacques <unk> here and put this blue friends on the table .
Maybe maybe one .
And honestly , we might need a cow , right .
So , here we go .
And you see the role of the French , the <unk> <unk> , and the system goes out .
So let me final final idea , which is the most great Japanese writer of the last 30 years , the great art of art and meditation is required to be talent .
And what he talked about is not the price of an <unk> dollar $ 700 , or <unk> , and they 're created by the meaning of social importance and existence .
And I think it 's also the same thing that we need to ask about technology .
Technology is the ability to express the power of the <unk> , and actually we should be asked for the technology .
And for some kind of technology , it 's designed by design , this is <unk> .
We do n't have any progress , unless we 're in the beginning , to engineer the design process .
And <unk> and <unk> .
We , as humans , biology , should make sure that machine can help us , and to design the machine and build machines .
So I 'm here today . Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I 'm going to ask you one question -- is actually Bill Gates -- what ?
Chris Anderson : When we 're all going to use it ? Are n't it just in the laboratory ?
And this interface is that every individual can do it with a company or a museum company ?
John <unk> : Of course everybody can use it .
That 's our whole goal .
We 're going to get to the next important step .
I mean we 've studied 25 years .
Is it really a single user interface ? No .
Chris Anderson : But it does n't mean that at the table or home or home , you have to have <unk> ?
Well , how do you <unk> this interface ?
John <unk> : No , that interface will come every monitor .
Talk to <unk> .
There 's no pair of gloves in a couple of months or so on .
That 's certainly true .
Chris Anderson : Well , what do you think about five years later ?
John <unk> : I think five years later , you buy the computer for the next five years .
Chris Anderson : Yeah , that 's good .
And this world is always going to make something that we 're interested in using this stuff .
And what do you think the first most commonly used in your brain is what the interface is going to be ?
John <unk> : This is a good question , we 've asked ourselves this day .
Now , our early <unk> , they 're using this system in the real world , using it to make all kinds of data .
The <unk> of the supply chains , gases and resources , <unk> , military information , biology , and so on , these are the applications that are present now , but it 's not an inclusive force .
I understand what you ask .
Chris Anderson : Yeah , <unk> , play , games .
John , thank you very much for making the truth .
John <unk> : That 's great to do this talk .
Thank you .

In the nearest EG conference , <unk> writers , philosophers , love of <unk> , who live on the experience of a year from the Bible , with the <unk> of his life -- as far as possible .
culture , entertainment , humanity , humor , religion , writing
<unk>
A <unk> is by the year of the Bible .
I 'm going to tell you what I want to write .
I like to support my research .
And I 'm directly going to jump directly into the <unk> of the mouse .
My life is like a series of experiments .
I work for magazine for a few years ago , and I wrote a piece of paper called " My <unk> Life " -- I hired a team of <unk> in the <unk> Bangalore to my own life .
So they helped me back .
They help me hear power .
They went to me and helped me read my story with my son .
This is my favorite month in my life , because I 'm just going to tell you a little bit about the film , and I read the film .
This is a fabulous experience .
And I wrote a articles for magazine , and it 's called <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> / <unk> psychologist , and he says people should n't lie , unless it 's in <unk> or golf .
And even , as any thing happens in your brain , it 's a voice .
I decided to make it possible for a month .
This is the worst month in my life .
I did n't recommend doing that .
And I 'm telling you , you know , this is what you 're doing .
So , that 's hard .
My latest book -- <unk> 's book is called " <unk> , " which is about the year that I 've been looking at when I try to learn how to study the world , or to the end .
It 's exciting to be able to finish the end , like <unk> <unk> , so I do n't want to paste it .
But I love this idea because it 's an experiment about how much information can absorb .
Now , according to the <unk> of 2007 , you 're just going to be able to get to it .
It does n't need to remember it .
So I wasted time on this .
I like to experiment with these experiments , but I think the best thing about life is that I 've spent the last year , and I spent a year trying to work with the principles of life -- " By the <unk> principle of the Bible . "
And I think there are two reasons why this is true .
First , I grew up in a totally secular environment .
And as I said , I 'm a Jewish man , like " <unk> Red , " as a <unk> Republican .
So , of course , that 's not true .
But I have become interested in religion .
And I think , in our lives , this is an estimate of one problem , or a major question .
And I have a son . I want to know what to teach him .
So I decided to participate in the Bible , trying to move through the Bible .
And the second reason I decided to do that , because I 'm passionate about the rise of women , a lot of people who claim that they 're completely autonomous , and it 's about 45 or 50 percent of the American people in the world .
So I decided to look at it , actually , to work with the Bible ?
I decided to accept that the <unk> of it and its logic is <unk> by <unk> , not to choose .
First of all , I 've found a bunch of Bible .
I have compassion .
I have an <unk> Bible .
And one of my sons is , I 'm called " <unk> <unk> , " which is 23 , founder of God , and I know that all of you should be " God " is the " girl . "
And I read a couple of versions , and I wrote that I could find the <unk> .
This is a very long list -- 700 <unk> .
And these <unk> had some famous <unk> , and I 've heard about it -- so I 'm going to die .
And I 'm very excited about this project because <unk> , I was born with twins , so I did really seriously .
But I want to take a picture of hydrogen <unk> in the Bible , <unk> <unk> .
These are the humpback seals in <unk> -- " The week of <unk> is <unk> . "
I do n't know where my neighbors are , so I decided to give you the end .
You know , I 've spent a long time in the police department .
And the last two months , my wife would n't have me .
So , of course , this is a challenge .
And the Bible says , you ca n't wear a clothing . So I thought , " That sounds strange , but I 'm going to try it . "
You just know what you 're trying to do .
I 'm dealing with <unk> <unk> .
And the Bible says , if there are two men in the <unk> , one of the men who get to the other man 's wife , and then her hand is going to hit her hands .
So I want to obey this one .
My approach to <unk> <unk> is -- do n't negotiate with people , if his wife is standing there , and she looks very powerful .
So -- <unk> , this is a picture of me .
I 'm going to say that this is a surprise for a year , because it 's a change of life , and it is a huge challenge .
And there are two types of <unk> .
One is to avoid something that we 're going to make every day .
I could n't do that entire entire year , but a year no longer , no <unk> , not lying -- I lived in <unk> and I was a journalist , so I had 75 to 80 and 80 .
But this is interesting because I can do something that I do n't believe that my actions can change how many things I have .
This is one of the most important lessons that I learned about this year , and I was almost like a good person , but I really had a little bit better .
I always thought , " You change your mind , and then behavioral action changes , but I found that always opposite .
You change it , and you change your mind .
So you know , if you want to become more compassionate , you go to the hospital and look at the risk of chronic people .
To give money to a professional , then you put emotion in .
So , this is cognitive science -- it 's not a <unk> -- that 's what I 've done .
The Bible is essentially about cognitive science , very basics .
And <unk> said that , if you smile , you become happy , like we are .
And the second <unk> of <unk> is that these seals allow us to meet the American 20th century .
One of the obvious examples is : take stone rocks .
But this is a huge chunk of the Bible , so I think I have to get out .
So , I was really <unk> a cow .
And it happened -- I was in the park , and I sat on the <unk> of my Bible -- <unk> and <unk> -- you know , it 's the influence of the influence .
I want to understand that <unk> <unk> , how to influence my heart .
And this man came to me and said , " Why would you like to paste like this ? "
And then I explain my project , and then he says , " Oh , I 'm a beginner , you 're going to take the rocks to <unk> me ? "
And I said , " Wow , that 's great . "
And then I came up with my toes of the <unk> , and I 've taken these rocks for a couple of weeks , hoping that it 's going to happen -- and then you know , these are little <unk> -- but that man <unk> the rocks from my hands .
He 's actually a <unk> , <unk> .
But he 's still <unk> , and it looks very upset .
And he came out of my hand and fell in my face and I felt -- I would say , " <unk> , I can do it with him .
So this is my <unk> experience . It makes me even serious about these important issues .
Why is this <unk> in some part of the Bible ? And in other parts of it , it 's incredible .
How do we think about the Bible ?
We should look at it , and you know , it 's like an <unk> Bible , like a <unk> Bible ?
How do you get the Bible ?
And yet , since it 's a technology of technology , let me say that the Bible makes me think of Wikipedia , because it is written by many people , and it comes from <unk> .
The Bible is an emerging process .
Not a lot of books from <unk> .
So I 'd like to tell you that it 's just a few months , and I 'm going to tell you about the lessons and lessons from which I <unk> <unk> .
The first is -- you understand the Bible 's code .
That 's a beginning .
Because if you do this , you will end up like a cow , and it 's a <unk> , or -- there 's another example .
Okay , this is another -- I spent a lot of time .
This is a very <unk> professional . I 'm very revealing .
But this is one of the things that the Bible told us not to touch the women in every month , more <unk> -- you ca n't sit in the <unk> women .
My wife was <unk> women , so she took me home of every chair in my house , and I had to stand up for a lot of time .
So , you know , I meet some <unk> .
I went to the museum of <unk> .
They are people who are <unk> .
And this is very <unk> , because they 're not glamorous .
And I 'm going to bet that the <unk> of his <unk> is the same .
It 's just a very strong belief that they have on the basis of the Bible , so it 's <unk> the data .
And then they 're doing the magic of fantastic practices .
And I 'm going to say that this museum is very glamorous .
They really have a wonderful job .
If you 've ever been to the United States , this is this -- you 'll see a film about the scale of the big temple , and they 're <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , when it comes to the <unk> waters , when you 're <unk> water .
So , regardless of what you 're thinking about , they 've done a fabulous job .
Another lesson is : thank you for a specific session .
This is a very important <unk> because I do n't want to thank you , and this is the <unk> of <unk> .
But I did n't want to thank you , if I started changing my view , I began changing my view .
And starting to tackle a bunch of little things , those are the things that I do n't notice , and those who are n't aware of , of course -- not to notice these three <unk> things .
So , this is the joy of happiness , for me , to remind me that when I 'm going to let you go here , I do n't have <unk> , and I 'm not going to hit it .
That 's a great thing .
And third , ladies and gentlemen .
This is the experience that happened , because I started a <unk> , but I ended up in this year a year , and my friends call me , I love this statement .
But I tried to try and transform <unk> .
So if anyone who wants to engage , the basic idea is , regardless of God , we have a lot of important and good concepts , and , our ritual is holy .
<unk> is God .
And one of the great things about this year is <unk> <unk> , because I could n't work with this day -- that 's really the change of my life .
So this is a holy concept , no matter whether God .
Thank you very much .
This is a feeling that I 've spent a lot of time in the United States , and I 'm going to show you all the different religions , because I hope that 's not an individual journey .
It 's a experience of experience .
So <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And I 'm proud of it , because , for me , the only person who can say to me is the only person in the United States .
And after three hours , he watched his watch , and he said , " I have to go . "
Oh , thank you very much indeed .
Thank you . Yves <unk> , thank you very much .
But it 's very glamorous , because I have a <unk> idea , for example , <unk> <unk> , and I found that this is a big <unk> of <unk> .
I 've met one community called Red <unk> , and they focused on the <unk> of the Bible .
In the old Greek Greek dictionary .
They said , <unk> did n't hear <unk> .
They had a <unk> , and they said , " That 's Jesus arguing about <unk> . When you beat it , nothing .
So they 're like , " Jesus talked about a lot of help about helping the homeless .
So this is a lot of inspired for me .
I refer to Jim <unk> and <unk> .
They 've been inspired by leaders , even though I do n't think .
And you ca n't delay glass .
This is very glamorous , because , you know , I grew up in a <unk> worldview . But I 'm very surprised , and my life , actually , is driven by <unk> force .
But if this is hostile , it does n't need to be completely <unk> .
Because I learned -- I 'm thinking , I do these rituals , and these guys who are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> . I asked these people , " Why do n't you tell us that it 's <unk> ? "
And they said , " We do n't know , this is just a trick for us . "
I said , " That 's crazy . "
They say , " Oh , that 's what you 're not ? "
You 've got the candle in the day , and this is a ritual .
If one of the guys in Mars saw , he would say , " There 's a guy <unk> cake on the other hand , and it says " Oh , this guy is rational , but it 's really <unk> .
So the key is to choose the right ritual , which is non - <unk> -- rituals are n't supposed to be .
But , most convincingly , I learned : you should have options .
That 's because I want to go to the <unk> Bible all the time .
And I failed <unk> .
Because you do n't .
You have to have options , but anyone who does n't obey the Bible is not glamorous .
The point is : selecting the correct part .
There 's a real <unk> called " <unk> <unk> , " which means that they 're going to say : " Oh , this is n't the <unk> religion .
You just choose to do it with <unk> . "
But <unk> : " What do you do ? "
I had a very happy experience in <unk> .
There 's also a historical experience .
So , this is about selecting the <unk> of the Bible , <unk> , love and love that you do n't choose , " the " <unk> " or whatever , or the violence , it 's also very glamorous .
So what we do is we find significance in this book , we have to really engage it .
But before I ended up saying I was saying <unk> .
This is the picture I 'm reading in the Bible .
This is what I refer to the fall .
It 's effective -- and it 's actually a billboard that 's a rented chicken , so <unk> had to be taken in the morning morning , but it 's pretty good for me .
So , do n't you , thank you very much .

And on top of the <unk> " cognitive anesthesia " -- we 're doing the same amount of sharing , online collaborative engineering . When we edit the editor , we are creating a better , more cooperative world .
collaboration , community , culture , technology , wikipedia

<unk> <unk> : How cognitive <unk> change the world
The story begins in November 2007 , the president of the Japanese elections , <unk> , and this election is just finished .
A lawyers in Nairobi , <unk> <unk> , some of you might recognize her -- she 's in her blog . Her blog called Kenya .
And in the end of the election , it 's a lot of times when you 've done the powerful <unk> for the press .
And the blog is coming from the part of the media Foundation , trying to understand what 's going on in place .
<unk> brings her blog to more information .
There 's a lot of literature coming in . <unk> <unk> is collecting up .
She realized , " <unk> . "
I can work every day a day .
Now , information about Kenya is not just a single person who does n't have a single person anymore .
There is a way to get a <unk> way . "
And two companies read her blog , and she said , " We can help build a <unk> program . "
And the name of this name comes from <unk> <unk> or " <unk> , " and it 's a very simple way of doing it , which is , in the world , from the Internet , to the <unk> reports of the mobile or the text .
That 's it , that 's what it requires , because it 's to sell all of the unseen information -- everyone knows what violence is in place , but nobody 's going to get rid of it -- so that the program is <unk> in the map , and then the end of this project is so <unk> .
That website is called " <unk> <unk> , " in April .
There 's plenty of people looking at this website , and it 's also found that it has enough values , so they 're determined to change it and try to move it into a platform .
It was used in the Japanese elections of the Gulf .
It 's also used to get rid of the <unk> of Washington D.C. .
The most famous thing is it 's used in the next chromosome .
Now , when you see the map of the <unk> on the front page , you 'll notice that <unk> uses the world , right ?
This technology has been in the early ' 80s at the beginning of the decade of East Africa , a <unk> development of a network .
And what <unk> did was to leave digital technology out there .
And what <unk> did was to leave the human shared .
Now , interestingly , social design needs to depend on these two conditions .
This is what I tell you .
I call it the cognitive Revolution .
It 's what it means to be a huge <unk> in the large , global project .
The cognitive bears consists of two components .
And first , obviously , it 's the global world of time and time .
More than half a year in the world , over 50 percent of the time in the world .
That 's the amount of data in the 20th century , but in the 20th century , we did n't have it yet .
Let 's talk about the other half of the cognitive challenges .
The 20th century is really good in helping people do it , so it turns out , we 're very good at consumption .
But now we use the media -- the Internet , mobile phones -- let 's do something more , but we 're seeing that people are not sitting in front of the television , because we tend to do other things .
We used to sit in front of the TV because we had a choice .
Of course , we like to consume .
But we also like to create , and also shared sharing .
<unk> add -- it 's a passion for the human race , modern tools that make this passionate , a new design .
Using cognitive capacities , we 're more likely to see real <unk> , literature art , political art .
design .
We have lots of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is a group of a bunch of cute <unk> at the most sweet times .
They 're part of the larger media landscape .
And this is just one of the things that we 've seen , and we see a lot of <unk> .
I just wanted to say , as a lawyer said , <unk> <unk> is the most stupid art for art .
And of course , there 's other things , but it 's a <unk> example .
But there 's a little bit of art to work with art , even the art of art .
Some people have created something like this , whether it 's <unk> or <unk> , and they 've tried to show the public .
And once they did it , they could do it again again .
There 's a space between <unk> and <unk> , any artist or creator , and this space is all you 've always been trying to achieve .
This is also the gap between <unk> and <unk> .
The people who made <unk> are already crossing this gap .
Now you do n't have <unk> , we want to get a tutor , right from <unk> to serious work .
But the public media never works .
Freedom , which means freedom to try and try anything .
Even in the holy <unk> , <unk> had 150 years earlier .
And before I talk about the importance of <unk> and <unk> , I think they 're sharing their resources .
It 's a resource for sharing .
This is a very curious time in our history , even cognitive anesthesia , as well as the resources we 've designed , and the scientists are starting to explain what we 're dealing with . We 're doing it because we like to do this , not our boss .
This graph comes from the work of <unk> and <unk> , and they test them for 10 years ago , called " <unk> . "
<unk> is the most simple theory of human behavior , if you do n't want people to do something , just to connect .
Very simple , <unk> , really , very important , and also a huge test .
They went to Israel , and they studied <unk> <unk> .
And they studied the most sought of these <unk> centers , which is the return of the kids .
At the end of the day , there 's a teacher that 's going to be the teacher who wants to go back to their children .
At the same time , parents -- maybe work , <unk> -- that might be probably late at the moment .
So <unk> and <unk> said , " How many <unk> kids have <unk> for <unk> ? "
And now they see -- this is the number of times that number eight , which is two - year - olds -- six to 10 children per second .
So they <unk> the <unk> center into two groups .
White pile is the control , no change .
But the <unk> center of the black hole , they say , " Now , we 're doing this change now .
And if you take a kid at the age of 10 , we do n't care about 10 <unk> .
That 's it . There 's nothing if , but it 's <unk> . "
And it 's happening when they make change , and the center is happening .
And then the number of kids around the next week are rising , until they 're going to increase the increase in three three times , and then they get twice about twice .
And you see it immediately .
<unk> <unk> the equation of the <unk> .
Because increase the <unk> , the way they communicate with parents , to bring their teachers to 10 <unk> of the teachers , and the parents do n't want to be <unk> or feel bad about the teacher 's <unk> .
So the parents , they say , " Ten , 10 . "
What about the <unk> ? "
And by the end of the 20th century , it 's that we are <unk> , self - <unk> actors . In this explanation , there 's no <unk> -- no limit .
But no .
They 're in social byproducts , not <unk> .
And the point is that social regulation to create more cultural culture than <unk> .
So at the end of the <unk> and the Grand Canyon -- it 's a couple of weeks , and they say , " Okay , that 's good . All right . "
Really interesting phenomena happened . Nothing changed .
<unk> change is the same thing , and it does n't have to vary in a long way .
It 's not just the economic force and the intrinsic force , the <unk> , the <unk> .
And the key to design this is to understand the economic behaviors of <unk> , what you 're going to do -- as parents pay teachers , when you go through the social values of the teachers and how you serve people .
This is going to be my <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
I think it 's important .
They depend on cognitive bears .
They 're designed to be designed for people and sharing .
And the key to the other : <unk> <unk> is a public value .
It enters the values of the individual .
And the social values on the Internet are all there . Every time you see the amount of <unk> , the <unk> of sharing , whether it 's a video , or a YouTube video , or something .
These are good . I like to talk to you about the other person , and maybe I 'm going to love it . But it 's not a problem .
I could n't imagine the future , as anyone said , " Where are we going to get a cute <unk> ? "
Instead , <unk> is an citizen .
It enters its values , but the whole society is sharing .
The goal of <unk> is not only about the lives of their own life , but every single person in the world has a better life .
The value of civic values is not just about <unk> human motivation .
It 's really a huge effect on us .
It 's a six - year - old boy who 's free for your free values .
<unk> years later .
The people who are involved in these projects are increasing . We also see different organizations in the culture of sharing , even without large contracts , and this is a very , very different <unk> pattern .
What 's different , as an inventor and an entrepreneur called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> said , " free culture makes you glamorous , celebrate . "
We 're facing a choice now .
We have hundreds of two hours per year .
We can use them to make everyone happy .
And we 're free for free .
But we also also have to celebrate and engage and reward people to create the values of civic values .
And in many ways , we 're going to do that , and we can change the society .
Thank you very much .
<unk>
This is a famous cultural phenomenon : India 's <unk> <unk> describes the rise of 20 or 20 times the development of modern India and the modern Indian Indian development , and he 's going to try to understand how India is made out of <unk> , the <unk> of the Indian <unk> and millions of people who have a <unk> .
business , culture , entertainment , productivity
<unk>
Yves <unk> : The rise of India , India
And I 'm going to introduce you to the latest painting of <unk> in India , and it 's possible to be the longest in the world , and it 's the longest time in <unk> , which is the <unk> of the Earth .
And I hope it 's going to stay forever , because there 's a lot of people , like , I 've got a living .
<unk> has all sorts of important things : love , pleasure , happiness , joy , <unk> , with laughter , but there 's still <unk> and <unk> of laughter and the <unk> -- and there are still races associated by laughter .
So , like all of the great <unk> , the change in the audience has been interested in as well as audiences .
This is the experience of <unk> .
It 's in 20 years of the time .
And this is the theme of a little change that I 'm going to talk about today , a little revolution .
<unk> is n't always like today .
It 's not the beginning of a decade , it 's <unk> movement .
And once you have a period of time , when you 're involved in the <unk> movement , you 're participating in an infinite game , and you do n't have time to limit it .
And in 2008 , there was a competition in the three - year - old age , three in <unk> .
And the reason for it to end it is that the British <unk> had to sit down for two days from the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> to the next 17 days , to <unk> on the 17 square <unk> of <unk> .
So , I did n't think they 're going to stop .
And one of the founders of England said , " What do you remember ?
It 's more than half a hour . "
This is about 12 hours after 12 days .
That 's two Sunday nights . But the Sunday month is <unk> , and of course , you ca n't use it as a <unk> . And then you 've got a one - on - one - on - a - one ratio .
But from here , you can see why this Indian love love is because we have the same <unk> .
It 's about the Mahabharata , right ?
You fight a day . And then the sun gets back , everybody goes back home .
And then you go to fight again , and then you go home and go home .
The only difference between <unk> and x - <unk> is that everybody is alive , and everybody 's going to go back home .
And the <unk> of India often looks at the love of this movement , but because it 's a way of <unk> , it 's the way they 're wearing <unk> .
But the Chinese love <unk> , and there 's another reason that you just need a piece of paper , a couple of partners , and you can do it in any place .
You can look at a glass of rocks and you can sing you in a <unk> , you ca n't live in any air , because it 's going to hit the wall .
And you 've got to stand up in the Congo River , and you 've always had that luxury .
Or in a little boat , you could n't even get a coach at the same time , even if you did n't have a competition for you .
As you 've seen earlier , all of you can see .
But slowly , the movement happened , and it was ultimately the end .
You do n't always have to sleep for five days . So we 're going to start playing 50 <unk> .
And then one big icon happened .
In India in India , we do n't have to make a big event , but it has always been documented , in the right time , right .
So we won the Nobel Prize in 1983 .
So all of a sudden , we grew up with 50 percent of the founders of <unk> , and we <unk> 50 meals per day .
There 's more than anywhere else .
Suddenly , another big day arrived .
1983 , we won the year - old year .
And then , in 92 , we found a Prime Minister Minister and a foundation , and they wanted to get the world to know about India that India was n't glamorous at the end of the world .
So we sent <unk> into India .
We took off the <unk> of <unk> , and we asked them to go into a <unk> budget , where they were paying attention , so they had to feel a little bit more optimistic .
And there are two <unk> of <unk> , which is real , a <unk> .
And that 's the true fact that India is true in the real world .
So one of my friends , I was sitting in front of this , from the <unk> of <unk> , who decided to choose the world to do the globalization of globalization .
So Pepsi <unk> , because they start to dominate the <unk> .
So the <unk> movement began to start with <unk> , starting to bring money to India .
The TV is starting to say , a long time ago , television always says , " We do n't talk about it , unless you give us money . "
And now they 're saying , " Well , that 's good for a million dollars per second .
Next million dollars . "
Something like a little bit of curve rises .
So we did this in a important event .
And the U.K. has developed 20 <unk> of chess , and then said , " There are 20 players worldwide . "
It 's been invented by the British Revolution , and they 're not allowed to perform the world .
I do n't believe it .
So , you see , India has to beat 20 <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
We do n't really want to join the <unk> .
But eight percent of the voting doubled of us have to join us .
And then something dramatic happened happened .
We 've got the last year , and this moment is going to be a moment for everybody who will never see .
The <unk> of Pakistan in Pakistan would n't want to go to the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah . India won the ball !
So this is a very exciting <unk> last year .
India is the world .
India is <unk> .
This is the spell of <unk> , and he 's going to get <unk> the air , but it 's the great <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> , India , <unk> the world .
Suddenly , India found 20 <unk> of <unk> .
And of course , this <unk> is actually suggesting that the <unk> of Pakistan still thinks that our <unk> are rapidly fast .
If he really did a quick quick <unk> , it would come out of the way , but they did n't have expectations about it , and we suddenly found that we really were really good at this campaign .
And <unk> gave the camel a little confidence to make sure that India can become the best of the world .
At the time , it was just a little confidence in India that was just more confidence .
And then this hurricane brought us more confidence to success .
That <unk> is a good thing to invent , and we do n't have the same thing about what they 're doing , but they make the world good .
So , in the U.K. , I developed <unk> <unk> , and then let 's have a <unk> champion of India .
This is a different design that we 're designing in the medicine , and we do n't have to take it directly .
And then we launched our own <unk> <unk> .
Six weeks , the competition for cities and cities .
And this is a first time for us , and we just support our country -- in India , only two things that can make the Indian <unk> .
One is the Indian military personnel in the war , and of course we do n't want it .
And then the other thing is that India is broken .
And now all of a sudden , we have to support our cities .
And people get involved in the <unk> of these cities .
This is the <unk> of the United States , and so people say , " Okay , that 's good for us to develop some <unk> in India . "
Is it India ready ?
Because in a long period of time , it 's all about organizing planning in India .
It 's never been seen as a commodity .
Take a look at what they 're doing with these beautiful <unk> and very simple families .
And everything happened .
This is a birthday show of other birthday birthday .
This is the Indian <unk> and the <unk> India .
This country increased the number of people per month per month .
So this is a new one .
But at the same time , it 's also a very scary thing to get into the modern , and they 're willing to expose the idea of what India thinks about this idea .
So when people saw the first time they saw <unk> .
Everyone was <unk> . But nobody would admit they were in <unk> .
The new Prime Minister of the Indian <unk> is not elderly .
And they were n't forced by the <unk> of <unk> , and they 're all <unk> people who are makers of these things .
So they started to start building the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And then you create huge amounts of <unk> .
And I mean , it 's about 23 billion dollars of income in the first round of the sphere , and we 've got 16 million dollars a year , which is the same amount of money that 's going to be sold after , but what they need to do is to attract the city to the West and they have to <unk> the Western , right ?
But they 're particularly good at bringing the West to the West .
So let me give you a example of how they 're doing what they do , their propaganda , but it 's a very Mumbai .
Of course , some of you say they 're okay , they do n't have to win .
But they said , well , that changed the way we look at <unk> .
And then , if you need a young <unk> , you 're going to go to the end of you , and you have to be able to get the system that makes you <unk> .
Now , all of a sudden , if you want to have a hand - hand hand , you do n't need to go to the <unk> , and they 're not going to run into the corner , or you can find a lot of people in the park that they can go directly to <unk> .
It 's been a new Indian , right ? This is an <unk> , and it 's a <unk> you can exploit in any place where you 're trying to figure out what you might find .
And then all of a sudden , all across India realized that you could choose the most <unk> <unk> of <unk> , which , everywhere .
So , in Mumbai , the <unk> of Mumbai could be <unk> , and the next day , if he had to go back to the West , would you ask him , " When are you going to ? "
And he said , " I have to take time . So I have to get out today . "
And we say , " No , no , not asking you , but ask you to get there . "
So he said , " I have to go on X Face . "
And they said , " Okay , you 're <unk> . "
So he was in <unk> , and then he sat directly from the pond to the airport to sit on a private bank , sitting in the face of the temple , in Portugal . And so he could move the West .
That 's the big thing that India does n't think .
I never wanted to say that somebody would say , " I 'm going to give him a coach to my doctor , and I have to send him to another game . "
And sometimes I have a person who thinks , " Wow , we 've got to get a degree .
We <unk> ideas , and we arrived .
And it also makes the most important thing about India : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> movies .
<unk> and India are still there .
But they 're starting to have relationships because some of the Japanese people start to open <unk> , become the boss of <unk> .
So people started to see <unk> in <unk> .
People started to look at <unk> and see the <unk> .
And some interesting things happened .
In India , you can see some of the founders of <unk> in India .
And that allows us to start with the <unk> of India .
Now , of course , if you 're a gamer in the video , you 'll see it in a video clip , when you do good things . You get a <unk> <unk> .
This is a bonus reward . Look at this . Everyone 's looking at the <unk> .
But of course , I have to mention <unk> <unk> in Calcutta .
She 's got a lot of players who have never seen this kind of competition , singing the songs of the <unk> song , <unk> the audience , not for the Indian <unk> , but for Calcutta .
And then look at this .
A Japanese <unk> and a Pakistan <unk> <unk> , because they all support <unk> ; they 're <unk> .
Can you imagine that ?
And you know what <unk> <unk> said ?
I wish I could join the subway team for <unk> .
And I think I have to grab this opportunity to sit in my friends , from Pakistan .
But I 'm happy to you , because I think we can prove that we could be friends .
We can do it together , we can be friends .
So folks in Pakistan , thank you very much today .
And , of course , there 's a voice that 's going to say , " Ha - ha is getting bought ?
They 're oppressed ?
Am cattle alone ? "
They say that because we have <unk> .
How do you give a <unk> ?
There 's a guy who 's going to start with <unk> , and it 's something that 's worth <unk> .
It 's like this .
<unk> : Come on . [ <unk> ] .
[ No " <unk> <unk> .
<unk> spent 50 million dollars a day , so it 's a test for me to get 250 feet of <unk> , and if you 're four days , you 've got 200 <unk> .
Now the best Indian <unk> , the <unk> test , did n't have a lot of <unk> at the same time .
That means they 're working , they do n't work .
This is the <unk> <unk> in England , and he made 150 million dollars a year in the U.K. , saying , " I 'm going to make money around the rest of the world than the Grand Canyon , so I made a lot more than <unk> . "
Where did he get paid ? From India to a small leopard .
Can you imagine this day ?
Six million dollars a day .
Very nice , right ?
Now , what do you know about 23 billion dollars ?
India always had the best to challenge the world 's best world , which is a brand of <unk> logo .
Yves <unk> 's <unk>
<unk> becomes the most <unk> brands in India , because the Japanese is going to move to South Africa to South Africa , and we 're starting three weeks ago .
In the next three weeks , three weeks before the players started to Africa .
Do you know why we do it ?
Because before we start with three weeks before the <unk> , we did n't have a lot of money than we do , but in the last weeks , we did n't have a high pressure .
And our <unk> , in a long period of hours , is the inertia of the rise of our development , and suddenly , <unk> becomes a moral , because there are more people looking at the <unk> -- a large amount of consumption .
We 're almost only the only move - to - one movement in India , and it 's very unfortunate , but in any other way , there 's only a little bit of a <unk> in India that can be a little bit of a <unk> .
So finally , I 'm going to admit that there 's a little bit of negative effects .
In a long period of time , India is a poor bear , and it 's a lot of people who have <unk> the snakes , the <unk> of the New Delhi Medical School -- and people have heard about the New Delhi ward .
And then , immediately , it becomes a big opportunity .
Everywhere around the world saying , " We love India , we love playing . "
You know , it 's really good .
So we said , " It 's really <unk> . "
And you can imagine that no , once you 're independently wealthy in this place , it 's been taken out of the window .
This is no longer true , no <unk> , all of the nuclear people disappeared all the time into the past , and this is the pattern of capitalism .
All right , finally , the theme of the talk today is that India is a movement in India , in the U.K.
Because if you want to <unk> the other country , you have to simplify this movement .
You ca n't teach people to one of the <unk> of China , in the last 14 days , but it 's never going to happen .
So you can do that .
I hope it allows everybody to be wealthy , and also hope that it 's going to take a lot of <unk> into a more sustainable stage .
Thank you very much . Thank you very much .

Dan <unk> demos his research process , sharing a lot of cool experiments with <unk> , and his talk has a question , which we can see in the TED context .
brain , choice , culture , entertainment , happiness , psychology , self , society

Dan <unk> : <unk> our mistakes
You 're doing decisions every day , who wants to figure out how to do the right thing -- whether the finance , or cooking , the career , the love of love , love .
Well , if anyone can replicate it every time we do it .
In fact , there were all sorts of people who had seen this before in <unk> , and he was Daniel Daniel .
This is what we 're going to tell you about why it is , even if you know what 's going on , it does n't work .
This is the idea of <unk> , the original description .
If it looks like a <unk> , because , well , it 's really <unk> .
There 's no way to translate from English -- but it 's basically the main idea of <unk> , which is the <unk> values that we do , or the benefit of the two things , the more powerful things that lead to success .
From a certain way , what happens is that if we can <unk> these two values , we always know how to do it .
And this simple equation , even if you do n't like the equations , is very easy to understand equation .
For example : If I tell you that we 're going to remember the coin , I throw a coin on the head , and you 've got 10 bucks , but you have to do it 10 dollars , you 'll have a hundred dollars to play a lot of people who say , well , it 's about 50 dollars a year , so I 'm talking to you about a $ 50 dollar .
And statisticians are called " <unk> <unk> . "
In the game of <unk> , it 's very simple , but it does n't have to be so simple in life .
They 're very upset about these two things that I want to talk about today .
When people make decisions , two false modes of error , the probability of <unk> success is <unk> .
We asked the first mistake .
And the chance of <unk> success seems to be a bit easier to forget about six <unk> , a coin , two or two dollars per pound .
Who knows the probability of <unk> A or <unk> , or in the face of a coin .
And it turns out that it does n't seem to be that simple , and that 's why Americans spend a lot of money in the United States , but it 's more <unk> than all the other people who spend the rest of the world .
And the reason for that is that probability is not what people calculate .
How do people calculate the probability ? Let 's talk about a question of cows .
And the question is , do you think that a single day , in Oxford , is a little bit more than the dog 's dog ?
And you all would say , of course , the dog is more .
And you come up with this dog , because you 've got to recall the dog 's dog and pigs .
It 's easy to remember to meet the dog as a dog , so therefore I suppose it 's going to be a little faster if you recall your dog should be <unk> .
It 's always true to experience , but you 're wrong .
Let 's take a guess again .
What are the four words of the word " four ? "
And you quickly recall it very easily , and it 's hard to remember <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
But in fact , even more , in English , more third letter is called <unk> .
Think about these words , and some of them are n't important , not uncommon .
It 's because our brains are based on <unk> .
You make a romantic word , and you can recall it .
It 's like <unk> , and three - thirds of the book is always very difficult .
So this is an example of the brain of a brain that describes the size of your probability , and this result is going to take you wrong , but not just crossword news .
So for example , in the Americans , the people who have been doing it , asked them to predict a lot of <unk> , and every two billion people die per year .
These are all people who are <unk> to me , because the reason why you 're dead : the bottom line is voting , <unk> , asthma and <unk> .
And this is what happens to real data .
A very interesting phenomena came up , and first of all , two different types of data : Katrina and <unk> .
And two <unk> of data have become <unk> , and why ? Why ?
When you read it in front of the paper , you 've read " <unk> dead " ?
This news is very boring because it 's too popular .
And it 's very easy to think about the TV , or the news that 's going to be <unk> the city , and there 's a lot of <unk> in the face of the <unk> <unk> .
Because there are more than many articles for <unk> .
In the head of the brain , it 's very <unk> , so we <unk> these things .
In fact , it 's like the " <unk> game " in a different way ? "
You 're more likely to die in the pool , more than three other things .
Buy milk is a great example -- it 's a fabulous example of the ability to calculate the probability of happiness .
The economist -- you buy the winning - winning guy who said that -- at least economists , thinks they 're going to sell lottery tickets , because you 're selling payment for the <unk> , and it 's almost like , you know , it 's like , you know , the damage is to get rid of your mouth , and it does n't have to be <unk> to the store .
How do you do that ?
There 's a lot of explaining , obviously , but there 's one of these winners that we 've seen , right ? There are a couple of libertarians in the door , and you have a huge check in your door -- how do you do this money ?
We saw it in the television , and we saw them .
But when you look at large - scale interviews , you have Parkinson 's won .
In fact , if we asked the camera to interview every winning of every pair of <unk> , a 30 seconds interview , one of the <unk> <unk> was going to go and told you , " I , lose a <unk> . "
If you look at the TV - and - a - half and a half minutes of TV -- you see a <unk> <unk> , and then the last 30 seconds , it 's a 30 minute , I 'm winning the lottery .
Now I 'm going to show you now : there 's a won .
There are 10 .
And those nine people sold to different people .
One of the two dollars , if you won your 20 bucks , how do you get 20 dollars ?
So the <unk> logic .
This is a win - year - old aspiration on two dollars .
And most people say , " Well , I 'm going to buy it . "
Now I 'm just going to change the same way of thinking about the other end of the crime for another nine or nine years .
<unk> had nine .
Are you buying ? Most people do n't buy .
<unk> <unk> did n't change , but it was more easy to see who they would win .
Obviously , yes , right ?
You do n't say , " I have opportunity to dance with other people . ' Obviously your <unk> ca n't .
All of the winning is a fact to change your decisions , even if it does n't make any difference .
<unk> probability may seem to be <unk> , but compared to <unk> values , which is trying to figure out how happy it is to try and give me how happy it is .
I want to talk about <unk> <unk> .
A lot of money . How much money does it cost ?
Your intuition is " <unk> , " you 're not going to lose money .
And yet , decided to make a difference whether it 's about 25 dollars per year , just ask a question , but what can I do with this 25 dollars ?
If you 've been in a long period of time to Australia , and you know that the airplane does n't provide food , when you sit down , you get a McDonald 's box , it 's glamorous , so that you can feel that 16 dollars per gallon in your nose , then you think that 25 percent of the time you feel about it .
I ca n't even get rid of it . I 've got <unk> glasses .
And all of a sudden , for 25 dollars a year , you buy a " <unk> " -- that 's a lot of money .
On the other hand , if you go to a poor country , there 's 25 dollars to buy a meal , and then " <unk> <unk> , " and " <unk> " is <unk> .
Why are you telling me that the answer should be " no " ?
Because you 've got to buy the price of a dollar , not to ask a question , " I can use these money . "
This is really easy to create <unk> mistakes .
And what you 're trying to do is , you 've got three dollars per gallon , and you get 25 dollars per year , and you 're doing it .
This is a mistake , and I can prove that this mistake is called <unk> <unk> .
For example , of course , this is a very common thing to tell you , and it 's so expensive that you 've got a lot of money .
We 've done a trial , where people are doing a job for two jobs , and you 're six million dollars per year -- and then five million , four million years later , is the same job that you 've got to get the second job , even if it 's a little bit more hopeful , but even knowing that this job is less .
Because they feel like they 're bad than <unk> , even though it 's a bad example .
There 's a 2,000 dollar bill . There is <unk> dollars now .
Suppose you want to go to Hawaii , you do n't buy the product ?
Most people are going to be , now , to change 2,000 dollars of Hawaii in America , and now it 's 700 dollars per year .
And then you go to the Grand Canyon , the best one has n't had to be 15 dollars per gallon . Are you going to buy it ? Lots of people would say , " No . "
Why ? Because 700 , I would never spend 15 percent of a week or 700 tribes .
And this is something that makes people give up a lot of good trade , and in other words , there 's still a better amount of money , even if you still have a good deal , it 's a bad thing to do .
Here 's another example , which says , " How to <unk> our eyes .
Suppose you want to go to theater .
Go to the theater .
You have a vote in your <unk> , 20 dollars per gallon .
And you have a poor dog .
When you get to the theater , you find out that clothing .
Would you go to buy a lot of money ?
Many people say , no !
Now , I just changed a situation .
You go to the theater , you have two dollars in your <unk> .
When it came to the theater , it was missing .
Would you do that 20 bucks ?
And of course , I went to the theater , and I went to the theater .
Do n't get 20 dollars for me in my way .
If you do n't know what I mean , it 's a simple explanation .
In the way , you lose something .
In two cases , it 's a piece of paper .
In one case , it 's the American <unk> <unk> , and another piece of paper does n't have .
What 's the difference ?
And the difference is , when you lose your dead , you 're not going to spend two dollars for <unk> .
What you 're going to spend now -- 40 dollars and 20 dollars per year .
It 's going to cause a lot of problems in the past , and economists and psychologists think that these problems affect the values of values .
But even if you do n't have anything else , the other way that we 're still going to do something like this .
Quick example .
" <unk> " is the same thing as things and other things change .
So in <unk> , George Bush , who 's standing on the side of the political community , and he does n't look like a ideal character .
Suddenly , we 're very upset with him .
Change about what we think about him .
And of course , people have already learned that it 's going to make a lot more money to do this .
When you go into a black hole , you have to buy a bottle of wine , and you 've seen the price of red wine : eight or 27 dollars , what do you do ?
Most people do n't buy the cheapest ones .
So they picked money on their own .
If you 're a clever <unk> , you 'll be able to put a lot of money in the mailbox , even if nobody 's ever bought because of the wine wine .
In fact , these are all you already know , " <unk> <unk> . "
But what 's the problem ? The problem with the question is that it 's going to be in the middle of a hundred dollars , and his value for the wine is in front of it .
It 's the same thing that we 're trying to do at the end of the day , and we try to decide how things are like , when we consume , it 's almost impossible to use things .
This is an additional <unk> problem that affects our rational decision .
Quick example .
I 'm going to show you one experiment .
And these experiments ask me that one of the most simple questions about this is you enjoy this bubble ?
And he 's sitting in front of the room , and I 'm sitting in the room .
In some experiments , they 're in the other room , and there 's something else that has <unk> chocolate , which is <unk> <unk> .
In fact , these things change in the corner of the ice , which is expected to enjoy <unk> .
That means that the people who see the <unk> will feel very , very glamorous , and see people like chocolate .
And then , what do they eat ?
It does n't need a furniture to tell you when you 're wearing your mouth , and you do n't have to do anything like your mouth , when you 're in the corner of the room .
But before you eat , people expected the food of food , it 's almost impossible to eat .
And all of you have experienced something like that , even if you did n't have my lab , I have a problem , and I have a question : you want to buy a <unk> .
You sell 200 dollars in your neighborhood , and if you 're driving through the <unk> , you get 100 dollars to buy one .
Would you be going to be able to buy a <unk> that 's worth a hundred dollars per year ?
Most people will .
They ca n't imagine the amount of money they 're going to get to the other side of the city , when it 's a half .
So let me suppose you 're going to buy a car that has a license to sell a hundred dollars on the door .
And the same thing is driving through the <unk> , and it 's just as if it 's <unk> .
Are you going to go ? That 's 100 dollars per year .
And so many people say , " No , I 'm not going to drive across the streets of the helicopter to save 100 dollars .
This is what <unk> economists do , and what should it do ?
Because you 've got 100 dollars : I do n't care about where you 're coming from .
It does n't know what to do .
You go to the supermarket , and it does n't say I come from <unk> , or I 'm an impostor from the car , which is money .
If you drive over 100 dollars a gallon , it 's about 10 dollars , and you 're doing it . But people do n't think so .
So this is why people do n't care about entrepreneurs from their investment , or <unk> <unk> , but they 're going to collect money for a dollar per dollar .
Now you see , it 's a problem , because you 're going to have the relationship between a hundred dollars and you have to buy the amount of money , you do n't do that .
You have this experience .
For example , if you 're a American , to France .
There might be a couple of classes in France , and they come from your home to travel , you want to say , " Oh , these are great questions for me .
Do n't let me try to say that French are more hate , I do n't say French people in the French , so you 're going to go back to the age of French France , and then you go back to the house , invited it to your house ?
And they 're boring than your other friends , right ?
And if you go to the <unk> , you have the same problem .
You go to a <unk> store , you see the <unk> , and then you 've got a big <unk> and a rock , which is <unk> -- and you 're trying to figure out what 's going on .
So <unk> took the money , and she would n't care about it .
The problem is , you 're going to do something about it , and it never happens when you go home .
You do n't go back to that <unk> store , and say , " The big hear is that it 's smaller than those little things that you might not remember .
It 's more complex than <unk> , in some cases .
In different ways , people are making decisions when they 're making decisions .
<unk> and behavioral economists find two simple principles of principles .
Now I 'm going to give you a very simple question , and then it 's the same simplicity problem .
The first simple question is : now you get 60 or 50 , where ?
This is called <unk> <unk> .
You all want more money because we think it 's good .
And the second question is you can get <unk> 60 or six month per month , where do you choose ?
Similarly , very simple decisions , because we know " now " right now . "
When these two rules are , they 're not doing it .
So , for example , 50 million or six month per month , you picked it .
There 's a lot of things that you have to wait for , and you have to wait .
So what do you do ?
Most of the time , people are very <unk> .
That means they 're going to ask very high interest to stop their <unk> , waiting for 10 dollars to get the extra 10 dollars .
Maybe this is a little bit too easy , but it 's a bit easier for people who have patients so easily .
Suppose you 've got 50 dollars a year -- that 's 12 dollars per year or 13 months later .
What 's the result ?
People are starting to wait , because they 've been waiting for 12 months to get to 13 months .
What makes decisions unsatisfactory ?
<unk> : <unk> . I 'll explain that .
This is an image that I just mentioned , and if I give you enough time to judge , what you find is that 50 dollars per year in the middle of the world is more valuable than only 30 bucks , but when we make decisions for a year , they have a very opposite behavior that they 've made .
So why do you see that result ?
Those two people explain us .
What you see here is two guys , one of the two <unk> : <unk> and road .
They do n't want to wait until they 're waiting until I want you to notice .
This is never going to be a little bit better than tagging .
And yet , the gap between them is smaller .
And you start to see the gap , and then three inches and two inches , they disappear from the horizon .
This is what I just showed you .
This is the high estimate that you see in different stages .
Now I want you to see , two things are true .
First , they look at the second end of our way , and it 's always more than a violin .
But what happens when we get something wrong ?
If we look at the <unk> , the violin is more <unk> than the Grand Canyon , but if you get rid of their normal , real relationships come out .
It 's like Jane percent of the impact on the effects of space as well as space .
And this is the answer to the question of <unk> , which is now 50 dollars per month per month ?
These are the behaviors that you can see here , the two <unk> that we 've got .
People tend to feel good about 60 dollars a barrel , and people will still think about it than 50 dollars per year .
Take a look at what happens when you take a few patterns .
Now , a little bit of a sudden , before we 've got a steady <unk> .
We 've seen that people tend to get 50 percent per year instead of waiting for a month , but in a larger amount of time .
We see a funny phenomenon -- that 's what people will change in the future .
And when that 's 12 months later , you say , why are you going to wait for the 60 dollars ?
I want to do this 50 dollars now .
So the question is , ask you a question , if we 're so ugly , how do we get to the moon ?
Because I can talk about two hours here , to show you the <unk> of the probability and values of people .
And the answer to this question , I think , is that you 've heard about it , and I 'm sure you 're going to hear that the brain is evolving in a completely different world -- our brains are evolving completely differently .
In the brain , people who live in the world are very , very short , and people are extremely short in their lives , so people do n't think that the most important thing is , they decide that most importantly , it 's " <unk> . "
The <unk> of the <unk> , the little equation that tells us that we should decide how to think about it .
And it shows why we think so badly , it 's so important to tell us about despair .
Human beings are only the only ones on the planet who are on their own hand .
We do n't have the highest amount of power , and we 've sampled the nature of nature , normally , to make sure that the extinction is <unk> .
Same thing , the only thing to <unk> us is that we decide ourselves .
If you get killed in 10,000 years , because it 's why we do n't use the gift of the world , the Dutch in <unk> is in the <unk> of <unk> because we underestimate the future of pain by losing joy .
Thank you .
There is Yves <unk> .
We have a little bit of time with Dan <unk> , and here 's the second question .
Are n't you saying that this pattern is also a terrorist agent to do a way to get rid of our way ?
In fact , I 'm doing a research project , and I 've been working on a <unk> project and a lot of content , which is about the U.S. forces in the United States where the U.S. forces can be used to make the border safer .
I 'm trying to tell them that terrorists is just a word for a range of events , and if they really worry about terrorists , they should ask a question , how to make a problem , what causes the problem and how they 're going to get us worried about the atrocities that we worry about .
In fact , the fact that the American media reports are in these events , and the amount of these terrorism are very small .
We already know , for example , more people die in the United States because they are afraid they 're afraid of flying in ice , because it 's much more <unk> than 9/11 .
If I tell you that there 's a widespread <unk> last year to death , if you do n't know this is " weak , " you might probably be very <unk> .
These are small events , and we should be able to get these things so that they should get .
There are obviously the effects that people have estimated that the amount of harm that are going to be trying to get rid of us .
Dan , I want to ask you , " Well , what do you mean that we 're going to make a difference ?
Okay ?
This is <unk> . You see it .
If you did n't have the first feeling of <unk> tomorrow , it might be the threat .
So the big country , the good people . But when a bus came up , 30 people died in the same country because of <unk> death .
Do you think that fear is normal ?
What causes this kind of spiritual force ? It 's an intentional effect for people .
Because that 's the International <unk> of <unk> ?
Or is it something else ?
Yeah , lots of factors , you 've misunderstood .
First of all , it 's a human organization trying to kill us rather than the ceiling , and we 're not going to hit us .
Secondly , our enemy may be going to hurt us again .
People are silenced , not the normal reason , but it 's a lot of reasons that sometimes people think they think about it .
So this is a lot of things that are stuck together , and we do n't forget , but we 're not going to forget what the content is to look at what 's going on .
I mean , how do you reduce this emotion ?
Go to Israel , go to Israeli Israel . Everything happened , and all of a sudden , every six hours later , at least when I got out of the <unk> , I went back to the hotel -- and I returned to a project that was good for a <unk> .
And as a husband , she said , we never would have a chance to influence our wedding .
I mean , this is a used society , and there are other societies that have the same social -- learning how to survive in the limits of terrorists , not to worry about the people who are not going to experience terrorists .
But what this fear is , is that we fear , because we 're afraid that the <unk> attacks might be more serious .
And of course , if we know this injury is the worst -- probably more 30 <unk> -- we probably do n't have that fear .
I do n't mean -- I 'm going to quote that someone else 's " terrorism " is not so glamorous .
This is n't what I mean .
And what I 'm going to say is that apathy is the same lessons that we 're dealing with with threat and threats to the size of the threat between what 's going on .
I think it 's not true for terrorists .
We 've heard a lot about how many people wake up saying that poverty ! poverty is giving us what we ! !
People wake up ; they do n't care about poverty .
The poorest wo n't be done by the headlines ; it 's not glamorous .
There is no silent press .
I mean , if you have to address one of those problems , what ? <unk> or terrorists ?
This is a hard problem .
No .
<unk> , from importance to importance , unless people have shown that capitalism has already had nuclear weapons .
I 've read it recently , and I think it 's more difficult to think about terrorists .
If that 's wrong , we 're all very stupid , but it 's almost a little bit more <unk> than poor poverty , and even more people are dead .
We 're very excited about the threat , because we do n't know why disease and other people are killing AIDS , so it does n't have enough energy to worry about this .
People die , normal .
If you 're attacked , you can do something about it .
So we have this reaction .
Is it this reason ?
You know what , those are the most important skepticism of all kinds of problems that evolution is about psychology .
And my suggestion is to never see anything from the world , but , if you go to looking for a evolution of evolution , you might say that most of them have a new " <unk> " -- and they 're afraid , different things .
One of the most important reasons is that you 've never eaten you , right ?
It 's never possible to see animals than animals .
So , when a school <unk> , we 've never seen this kind of fear that this fear is released , it 's released .
And I do n't think that 's a special mechanism in the field , as you 've heard earlier , but maybe it 's more important .
You know , economists love to talk about people who buy milk , but I suspect that when you celebrate these people , you have the same wrong logic , which is the wrong mistakes .
I said that because I 've been interviewing about 1,000 people in the last few decades .
<unk> , the values of theft , not to win .
But that 's what you think values , right ?
A regular <unk> year buy about 150 pounds , which actually does n't know what he would lose every year , and why ?
This is n't because of his brain .
It 's because the aspiration of winning the brain releases a kind of <unk> , allowing people to come up with <unk> .
<unk> a dollar , and a $ 100 dollar can get a lot better than the penguin , if you do n't feel good .
Now , economists tend to have all sorts of economists , and they 're trying to look at this world and see the world .
And a lot of people think economists are more stupid .
Anyway , humans can go to the moon because it does n't hear economists , thank you .
OK , so your vision is very good . But you 've got the joy of <unk> , whether it 's going to die , and remember : remember , <unk> won the next day : " <unk> <unk> . "
I do n't agree with those people .
Maybe they think that the probability is not big , but they 're more willing to buy milk instead of <unk> .
But I 've also seen your opinions : it 's , besides losing winning people to people .
There 's a lot of good news that 's not listening to that .
That 's not one of those , but there 's a lot of other reasons .
Last question .
My name is <unk> de <unk> , CNN .
And what I 've learned is that , more than anything else , I study aging -- it 's very promising to do this in this area .
And I 'm really sure that what you 're doing is that people do n't care about aging because aging is going to face life , it looks like a disease or a heart disease , and what do you recommend ?
What is the advice for you ?
They convince them .
If you convince you to convince them .
It 's a very difficult thing to do .
But there 's one thing that 's going to happen , and it 's a good thing to do , and it 's a good thing to do , and it 's a better way to think about the future .
It 's the future of decisions and decision decision - making problems that people are expected to think about the future .
You can find a lot of detail that helps people imagine a short <unk> and long - term environment , people start using the same way and the future .
Are you going to get more than 10 dollars a year ? This problem is complex , when you look at your age , if you think about what you 're looking at , how much of the chicken and what people live in .
Once we want to see the details of the future , we suddenly feel that we 're going to feel very important , so the retirement age will be rich .
But it does n't work .
And I feel like you 're going to fight with the most basic humanity , which is : I 'm here today to be more important today than today .
Thank you , Daniel , thank you so much for this talk . Thank you .

Michael <unk> on the new <unk>
And in the last year and across the team , I traveled in my church and Charlie <unk> and <unk> media , trying to create the first rapid <unk> literature .
It 's called " Our <unk> . "
It 's the sequel of " Inconvenient Truth , " and it explores all the ways to solve the climate problem .
That 's the beginning . This is the cover .
And then we can see that we 're going to see us . And we open the book to all sorts of titles .
Or we can <unk> the bottom .
If we want to zoom in a page , we can zoom in it .
Any thing you saw in the book , you 've got two <unk> pills that can zoom in .
If you want to go back to <unk> , you 're just going to fold it , and you 're just folding it .
That 's the same way . You pick it up , you <unk> it .

Mark <unk> : <unk> <unk> , Al Gore will tell you all the photos .
In this picture , you can see the pattern .
<unk> the map , and see where it is .
<unk> have a video of 18 hours of photography and interactive animation .
So you can open this up .
<unk> : One of the most modern wind plans .
<unk> : That video will start playing .
And when it 's playing , we can zoom in on the page , put it on a page .
Or we can zoom in in the <unk> , and the video is going to continue .
But one of the cool things about <unk> is interactive photography .
This shows the potential of wind in the States .
But not just show us information , we can use our fingers to explore , and see how many states are in the state .
We also know the information and the solar system .
This is one of my favorite senses .
Like this shows ...
When you start <unk> , anyone from the <unk> is converted into batteries .
And as far as the wind goes smaller , there 's a lot of energy that goes into the house -- and it goes down .
It 's not just in the <unk> .
It can also run in the iPhone .
In the living room , you can start reading and read at the iPhone .
Same deal .
You can choose any page .
<unk> it .
This is the first book of <unk> <unk> , Al Gore 's " Our Choice . "
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : That 's amazing .
You want to become a <unk> , a technology <unk> ?
What business does that business ?
Can anybody do that ?
<unk> : Yeah , we 've created a tool that allows us to be able to build something like this .
So the team of the media community is in the East coast -- we 're building this software to create this software -- using our tools every day , <unk> images and the text .
CA : So you want to send the software to the publisher to <unk> books like this talk ?
Okay , Michael , thank you very much .
<unk> : Thank you .

<unk> <unk> : A new idea of design
And the theme and the <unk> is a form of <unk> , because you 're always going to be <unk> with the theme of your head .
And you might say that the theme is the <unk> of nature and what 's the theme of it .
I think it 's about six years ago , and I 'm invited to create a series of ways to paint a painting of <unk> <unk> .
I 'm hard to imagine how to do it based on <unk> , and then I realized that I can take him as natural <unk> to look at the window , like <unk> <unk> .
And this is a huge amount of ownership .
Maybe it 's not a very nice observation , but it really makes me start to create some theme themes and <unk> , which is the great painting of <unk> -- " The <unk> <unk> " in <unk> .
And since I realized that there was a whole range of paintings that I did , I finished a series of photos on the bottom .
This is <unk> Ritchie , <unk> <unk> , one of the great <unk> of human history .
And I would n't do anything about this .
It 's just a series of <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> on the screen , which is a fabulous character , and it 's probably a very impressive movie of " <unk> . "
And he lost a eyes in the war , and it was why he always was on the side .
This is <unk> .
And then I thought I could move them a little bit , and that was the first time they did the same way .
<unk> ! They miss .
This is from the other painting from <unk> , and he comes from " Love , " like they 're going to start talking .
Now it 's <unk> . This is in the upper left corner . On top of the corner , there 's one side . On top .
By the way , I never understood the conflict between <unk> and <unk> .
Because all of the paintings are all derived from abstraction unseen .
And then one day , I was in my wife and I saw a logo , and she said , " That 's good design . "
And she said , " What are you talking about ? "
And I said , " Well , that 's really tough , because the purpose of this statement is to make you go to garage , and because most people are n't going to be the streets , so they can say that they 're really reliable . But everyone can tell them .
But , reliable , good news .
Because once you hear that word -- that 's a non - <unk> <unk> called " The ancient Times , " when you listen to this word , you think you have a child who 's going to get the finger to fall out of the <unk> and fall in the Netherlands .
So <unk> is more clear because of the use of <unk> .
If you think I 'm in a fool , it 's going to try to give the Indian <unk> to the other words .
Even the French .
Of course , but you know a lot of money .
I 'm going to take you very quickly through the real real process of making chaos .
And I did a lot of work for me for the arts of my art , a very glamorous called <unk> <unk> , which is often a little bit of a text that says , " Use it to do something . "
And he did .
This is a little bit of <unk> -- that 's exactly the same thing , whether it 's too glamorous , or <unk> , and do n't become the first ones who try to get to the end of the <unk> . "
I did n't have any idea .
And I was really trying to create it .
And the first thing I did was I had a lot of creativity , and I was able to tell you that I could n't write it and put some words in the background , but I expected , as people often want to do what they normally want .
And so I created another painting , and I <unk> it into a few , you have to go and try and print these words on a bad plate .
I think some of the things that are going to happen , like , " The Laws of words magic for the <unk> , <unk> <unk> " " Because it 's Alexander , but I 'll make it a little bit of it , and then I thought to it .
So , I fell into it .
Sometimes I was dealing with the problem , I would release what I knew about it .
And you can see a few thoughts from the beginning because you find the word " <unk> " from " old ' 80s . "
That 's the truth .
There 's a relationship between " <unk> " between <unk> and <unk> , " from the old age .
And then I did something about it , but it was still a good thing to do .
I have one more interesting version of it , and it allows all of the notes to the form of your mind .
The creator here is obviously the " <unk> , " which shows " even though they 're not very glamorous .
And so I 've got the word " self " and " <unk> " , " now I 'm going to go back to a certain point .
I was <unk> .
So I did something that really was quite embarrassing , and I found two other paintings that worked together .
And it says " dreams . "
And what I 'm going to do is , I 'll say , " Well , change this copy .
It 's a dream of the dreams , and you 're going to come up with your dreams . "
But what I 'm going to do is I feel so sorry about this , so I never <unk> this reputation .
I ended up using the next solution .
It does n't look like a lot of fun , but it has a different kind of thing .
For example , it 's cruel to <unk> , which is what should be seen and understand and understood .
