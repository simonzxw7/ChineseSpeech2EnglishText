I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts -- " If you have to explain it , it ai n't working . " 
And one day I woke up and I said , " Well , suppose that 's not true ? " 
So here 's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left . 
It says , " Thoughts : This poem is impossible . 
Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations . 
This one generates no imagery at all . " 
I am now exposing myself to my audience , right ? 
Which is something you never want to do professionally . 
" Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening . 
What 's the heart of this poem ? 
Do n't be trendy if you want to be serious . 
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself ? 
I guess one could reduce the idea further by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old , like this . " 
And then I show you a little drawing -- you see , you remember that old thing I discarded ? 
Well , I found a way to use it . 
So , there 's that little alternative over there , and I say , " Not bad , " -- criticizing myself -- " but more didactic than visual . 
Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace , a kind of dance where each defines the other . " 
And then more self - questioning -- " Am I being simple - minded ? 
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious , or the kind that looks profound ? 
There 's a significant difference . 
This could be embarrassing . 
Actually , I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition . 
Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school ? " 
Well , I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things . 
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience , and not to suggest that I am confident about what I 'm doing . 
And as you know , you have to have a front . 
I mean -- you 've got to be confident ; if you do n't believe in your work , who else is going to believe in it ? 
So that 's one thing , to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics . 
That can be a big contribution . 
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one ; you get the big one and if you do n't like that , how about the little one ? 
And that too is a relatively new idea . 
And here 's just a series of experiments where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square ? 
Now , this is a little illusion . 
That poster is not folded . 
It 's not folded , that 's a photograph and it 's cut on the diagonal . 
Same cheap trick in the upper left - hand corner . 
And here , a very peculiar poster because , simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer , it wo n't sit still in the space . 
At times , it seems to be wider at the back than the front , and then it shifts . 
And if you sit here long enough , it 'll float off the page into the audience . 
But , we do n't have time . 
And then an experiment -- a little bit about the nature of perspective , where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective , but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape -- is seen frontally . 
And another piece for the art directors ' club is " Anna Rees " casting long shadows . 
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts . 
There were 10 artists invited to participate in it , and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive and I did n't want to be embarrassed , so I worked very hard on this . 
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea -- was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city 's subway system so every time you got on the subway you 'd be passing a different poster , all of which had a different idea of what art is . 
But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of " art is " and trying to determine what art was . 
But then I gave up and I said , " Well , art is whatever . " 
And as soon as I said that , I discovered that the word " hat " was hidden in the word " whatever , " and that led me to the inevitable conclusion . 
But then again , it 's on my list of didactic posters . 
My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster , in case you do n't get it . 
Now this says , " Note to the viewer : I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte 's everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery , continuity and history . 
I 'm also convinced that , in an age of computer manipulation , surrealism has become banal , a shadow of its former self . 
The phrase ' Art is whatever ' expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art - making -- a sort of ' it ai n't what you do , it 's the way that you do it ' notion . 
The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word ' hat , ' hidden in the word ' whatever . ' The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined : as a thing itself , the worth of the thing , the shadow of the thing , and the shape of the thing . 
Whatever . " 
OK . 
And the one that I did not submit , which I still like , I wanted to use the same phrase . 
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari on letterforms some years ago -- sort of , see how far you could go and still be able to read them . 
And that idea stuck in my head . 
But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom . 
And , of course those are the remains , and they 're so labeled . 
But what really happens is that you read it as : " Art is whatever remains . " 
Thank you .

Newton Aduaka tells the story of Ezra 
This is very strange for me , because I ’m not used to doing this : I usually stand on the other side of the light , and now I 'm feeling the pressure I put other people into . And it 's hard ... 
The previous speaker has , I think , really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me , and my sense of loss , and trying to find the answer to the big questions . 
But this , for me , I mean , coming here to do this , feels like -- there ’s this sculptor that I like very much , Giacometti , who after many years of living in France -- and learning , you know , studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked , what did you produce ? 
What have you done with so many years of being away ? 
And he sort of , he showed a handful of figurines . 
And obviously they were , " Is this what you spent years doing ? 
And we expected huge masterpieces ! " 
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces was the culmination of a man ’s life , search , thought , everything -- just in a reduced , small version . 
In a way , I feel like that . 
I feel like I ’m coming home to talk about what I ’ve been away doing for 20 years . 
And I will start with a brief taster of what I ’ve been about : a handful of films -- nothing much , two feature films and a handful of short films . 
So , we ’ll go with the first piece . 
Woman : " I destroy lives , " mum said . 
I love her , you know . 
She ’s not even my real mum . 
My real mum and dad dumped me and fucked off back to Nigeria . 
The devil is in me , Court . 
Court : Sleep . 
Woman : Have you ever been ? 
Court : Where ? 
Woman : Nigeria . 
Court : Never . 
My mum wanted to , could n’t afford it . 
Woman : Wish I could . 
I have this feeling I ’d be happy there . 
Why does everyone get rid of me ? 
Court : I do n't want to get rid of you . 
Woman : You do n't need me . 
You ’re just too blind to see it now . 
Boy : What do you do all day ? 
Marcus : Read . 
Boy : Do n't you get bored ? 
And how come you ai n't got a job anyway ? 
Marcus : I am retired . 
Boy : So ? 
Marcus : So I 've done my bit for Queen and country , now I work for myself . 
Boy : No , now you sit around like a bum all day . 
Marcus : Because I do what I like ? 
Boy : Look man , reading do n't feed no one . 
And it particularly do n't feed your spliff habit . 
Marcus : It feeds my mind and my soul . 
Boy : Arguing with you is a waste of time , Marcus . 
Marcus : You ’re a rapper , am I right ? 
Boy : Yeah . 
Marcus : A modern day poet . 
Boy : Yeah , you could say that . 
Marcus : So what do you talk about ? 
Boy : What 's that supposed to mean ? 
Marcus : Simple . What do you rap about ? 
Boy : Reality , man . 
Marcus : Whose reality ? 
Boy : My fuckin ' reality . 
Marcus : Tell me about your reality . 
Boy : Racism , oppression , people like me not getting a break in life . 
Marcus : So what solutions do you offer ? I mean , the job of a poet is not just -- Boy : Man , fight the power ! Simple : blow the motherfuckers out of the sky . 
Marcus : With an AK-47 ? 
Boy : Man , if I had one , too fuckin ' right . 
Marcus : And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you ? 
Boy : Oh , Marcus , you know what I mean . 
Marcus : When a man resorts to profanities , it ’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself . 
Boy : See man , you ’re just taking the piss out of me now . 
Marcus : The Panthers . 
Boy : Panthers ? 
Ass kickin ' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist , powers - that - be bullshit , and just went in there and kicked everybody 's arse . 
Fuckin ’ wicked , man . I saw the movie . Bad ! What ? 
Director 1 : I saw his last film . 
Épuise , right ? 
Woman 1 : Yes . 
D1 : Not to make a bad joke , but it was really épuisé . 
Epuisé -- tired , exhausted , fed up . 
Director 2 : Can you not shut up ? 
Now , you talk straight to me , what ’s wrong with my films ? 
Let ’s go . 
W1 : They suck . 
Woman 2 : They suck ? What about yours ? 
What , what , what , what about , what ? 
What do you think about your movie ? 
D1 : My movies , they are OK , fine . 
They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees . 
What the fuck are you talking about ? 
Did you ever move your fuckin ' ass from Hollywood to go and film something real ? 
You make people fuckin ' sleep . 
Dream about bullshit . 
Newton Aduaka : Thank you . The first clip , really , is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me , and where I 'm coming from in terms of cinema . 
The first piece was , really , there 's a young woman talking about Nigeria , that she has a feeling she 'll be happy there . 
These are the sentiments of someone that 's been away from home . 
And that was something that I went through , you know , and I 'm still going through . 
I 've not been home for quite a while , for about five years now . 
I 've been away 20 years in total . 
And so it ’s really -- it 's really how suddenly , you know , this was made in 1997 , which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship , the worst part of Nigerian history , this post - colonial history . 
So , for this girl to have these dreams is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is . 
How -- and it 's sort of , perhaps romantic , but I think beautiful , because you just need something to hold on to , especially in a society where you feel alienated . 
Which takes us to the next piece , where the young man talks about lack of opportunity : living as a black person in Europe , the glass ceiling that we all know about , that we all talk about , and his reality . 
Again , this was my -- this was me talking about -- this was , again , the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom , and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say , what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people ? 
And what would a child -- what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think , I mean , with all this anger that 's built up inside of him ? 
What happens with that ? 
What , of course , happens with that is violence , which we see when we talk about the ghettos and we talk about , you know , South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff , and which eventually , when channeled , becomes , you know , evolves and manifests itself as riots -- like the one in France two years ago , where I live , which shocked everybody , because everyone thought , " Oh well , France is a liberal society . " 
But I lived in England for 18 years . 
I 've lived in France for about four , and I feel actually thrown back 20 years , living in France . 
And then , the third piece . The third piece for me is the question : What is cinema to you ? What do you do with cinema ? 
There 's a young director , Hollywood director , with his friends -- fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means . 
I suppose that will take me to my last piece -- what cinema means for me . 
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966 , a few months before the Biafran , which lasted for three years and it was three years of war . 
So that whole thing , that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece . 
Voice : Onicha , off to school with your brother . 
Onicha : Yes , mama . 
Commander : Soldiers , you are going to fight a battle , so you must get ready and willing to die . 
You must get -- ? 
Child Soldiers : Ready and willing to die . 
C : Success , the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun . 
CS : The barrel of the gun ! 
C : This is the gun . 
CS : This is the gun . 
C : This is an AK-47 rifle . This is your life . 
This is your life . This is ... this is ... this is your life . 
Ezra : They give us the special drugs . We call it bubbles . 
Amphetamines . 
Soldiers : Rain come , sun come , soldier man dey go . 
I say rain come , sun come , soldier man dey go . 
We went from one village to another -- three villages . 
I do n’t remember how we got there . 
Witness : We walked and walked for two days . 
We did n't eat . 
There was no food , just little rice . 
Without food -- I was sick . 
The injection made us not to have mind . 
God will forgive us . 
He knows we did not know . We did not know ! 
Committee Chairman : Do you remember January 6th , 1999 ? 
Ezra : I do n’t remember . 
Various Voices : You will die ! You will die ! 
Onicha : Ezra ! 
Various Voices : ♫ We do n't need no more trouble ♫ ♫ No more trouble ♫ They killed my mother . 
The Mende sons of bastards . 
Who is she ? 
Me . 
Why you giving these to me ? 
So you can stop staring at me . 
My story is a little bit complicated . 
I ’m interested . 
Mariam is pregnant . 
You know what you are ? A crocodile . 
Big mouth . Short legs . 
In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward . 
He ’s not taking care of his troops . 
Troop , pay your last honor . Salute . 
Open your eyes , Ezra . 
A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket . 
♫ We do n't need no more trouble ♫ Get that idiot out ! 
I take you are preparing a major attack ? 
This must be the mine . 
Your girl is here . 
Well done , well done . 
That is what you are here for , no ? 
You are planning to go back to fight are you ? 
♫ We do n't need no more trouble ♫ ♫ No more trouble ♫ ♫ We do n't need no more trouble ♫ ♫ No more trouble . ♫ Wake up ! Everybody wake up . Road block ! 
♫ We do n't need no more ... ♫ Committee Chairman : We hope that , with your help and the help of others , that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war . 
More than that , begin a healing process and finally to -- as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country ’s history . 
The beginning of hope . 
Mr. Ezra Gelehun , please stand . 
State your name and age for the commission . 
Ezra : My name is Ezra Gelehun . 
I am 15 or 16 . I do n’t remember . 
Ask my sister , she is the witch , she knows everything . 
CC : Mr. Gelehun , I ’d like to remind you you ’re not on trial here for any crimes you committed . 
E : We were fighting for our freedom . 
If killing in a war is a crime , then you have to charge every soldier in the world . 
War is a crime , yes , but I did not start it . 
You too are a retired General , not so ? 
CC : Yes , correct . 
E : So you too must stand trial then . 
Our government was corrupt . 
Lack of education was their way to control power . 
If I may ask , do you pay for school in your country ? 
CC : No , we do n’t . 
E : You are richer than us . 
But we pay for school . 
Your country talks about democracy , but you support corrupt governments like my own . 
Why ? Because you want our diamond . 
Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before ? 
No . 
CC : Mr. Gelehun , I 'd like to remind you , you 're not on trial here today . 
You are not on trial . 
E : Then let me go . 
CC : I ca n't do that , son . 
E : So you are a liar . 
NA : Thank you . Just very quickly to say that my point really here , is that while we ’re making all these huge advancements , what we 're doing , which for me , you know , I think we should -- Africa should move forward , but we should remember , so we do not go back here again . 
Thank you . 
Emeka Okafor : Thank you , Newton . 
One of the themes that comes through very strongly in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young that have to play this role of being child soldiers . 
And considering where you are coming from , and when we consider the extent to which it ’s not taken as seriously as it should be , what would you have to say about that ? 
NA : In the process of my research , I actually spent a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this . 
And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers -- ex - combatants , as they like to be called . 
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them . 
I met psychiatrists who spent time with them , aid workers , NGOs , the whole lot . 
But I remember on the flight back on my last trip , I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself , if any kid in the West , in the western world , went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through , they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives . 
So for me , the thought that we have all these children -- it ’s a generation , we have a whole generation of children -- who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage , and Africa has to live with that . 
But I ’m just saying to factor that in , factor that in with all this great advancement , all this pronouncement of great achievement . 
That ’s really my thinking . 
EO : Well , we thank you again for coming to the TED stage . 
That was a very moving piece . 
NA : Thank you . 
EO : Thank you .

In a wildly entertaining discussion with Richard Saul Wurman , architect Frank Gehry gives TEDsters his take on the power of failure , his recent buildings , and the all - important “ Then what ? ” factor . 
architecture , arts , business , creativity , culture , design , interview , invention 
13 
Frank Gehry asks " Then what ? " 
Frank Gehry : I listened to this scientist this morning . 
Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments , and I realized that I almost became a scientist . 
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and I decided to make water . 
So , I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator , and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker and I threw a match in . 
And the glass -- luckily I turned around -- I had it all in my back and I was about 15 feet away . 
The wall was covered with ... 
I had an explosion . 
Richard Saul Wurman : Really ? 
FG : People on the street came and knocked on the door to see if I was okay . 
RSW : ... huh . 
I 'd like to start this session again . 
The gentleman to my left is the very famous , perhaps overly famous , Frank Gehry . 
And Frank , you 've come to a place in your life , which is astonishing . 
I mean it is astonishing for an artist , for an architect , to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time . 
I mean you have become , whether you can giggle at it because it 's a funny ... you know , it 's a strange thought , but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building , it can be used in ads -- and you 've had not rock star status , but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life . 
And I know the road was extremely difficult . 
And it did n't seem , at least , that your sell outs , whatever they were , were very big . 
You kept moving ahead in a life where you 're dependent on working for somebody . 
But that 's an interesting thing for a creative person . 
A lot of us work for people ; we 're in the hands of other people . 
And that 's one of the great dilemmas -- we 're in a creativity session -- it 's one of the great dilemmas in creativity : how to do work that 's big enough and not sell out . 
And you 've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big , triply big . 
It 's not quite a question but you can comment on it . 
It 's a big issue . 
FG : Well , I 've always just ... 
I 've never really gone out looking for work . 
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head . 
And when I started out , I thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff . 
And I realized when I 'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff , and people would just look at me like I 'd just landed from Mars . 
But I could n't do anything else . 
That was my response to the people in the time . 
And actually , it was responding to clients that I had who did n't have very much money , so they could n't afford very much . 
I think it was circumstantial . 
Until I got to my house , where the client was my wife . 
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica and for like 50 grand I built a house around it . 
And a few people got excited about it . 
I was visiting with an artist , Michael Heizer , out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere . 
He 's building this huge concrete place . 
And it was late in the evening . We 'd had a lot to drink . 
We were standing out in the desert all alone and , thinking about my house , he said , " Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent , somewhere in 2000 years somebody 's going to like it ? " 
So , I thought , " Yeah , that 's probably a good idea . " 
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money , so the stuff was a little more permanent . 
But I just found out the world ai n't going to last that long , this guy was telling us the other day . 
So where do we go now ? 
Back to -- everything 's so temporary . 
I do n't see it the way you characterized it . 
For me , every day is a new thing . 
I approach each project with a new insecurity , almost like the first project I ever did , and I get the sweats , I go in and start working , I 'm not sure where I 'm going -- if I knew where I was going , I would n't do it . 
When I can predict or plan it , I do n't do it . 
I discard it . 
So I approach it with the same trepidation . 
Obviously , over time I have a lot more confidence that it 's going to be OK . 
I do run a kind of a business -- I 've got 120 people and you 've got to pay them , so there 's a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with , I think , a healthy insecurity . 
And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him : you 're not sure . 
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it , I saw all the mistakes , I saw ... 
They were n't mistakes ; I saw everything that I would have changed and I was embarrassed by it . 
I felt an embarrassment -- " How could I have done that ? 
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that ? " 
It 's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street , and it appears to have a relationship -- that I started to like it . 
RSW : What 's the status of the New York project ? 
FG : I do n't really know . 
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me , and I thought he was nuts . 
I did n't think he knew what he was doing , and he pulled it off . 
So , I think he 's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy . 
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up . 
They 're still talking about it . 
September 11 generated some interest in moving it over to Ground Zero , and I 'm totally against that . 
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero I think for a long time . 
RSW : The picture on the screen , is that Disney ? 
FG : Yeah . 
RSW : How much further along is it than that , and when will that be finished ? 
FG : That will be finished in 2003 -- September , October -- and I 'm hoping Kyu , and Herbie , and Yo - Yo and all those guys come play with us at that place . 
Luckily , today most of the people I 'm working with are people I really like . 
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that Disney Hall came to me . 
He 's been a cheerleader for quite a long time . 
There are n't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients . 
If you think about the world , and even just in this audience , most of us are involved with buildings . 
Nothing that you would call architecture , right ? 
And so to find one , a guy like that , you hang on to him . 
He 's become the head of Art Center , and there 's a building by Craig Ellwood there . 
I knew Craig and respected him . 
They want to add to it and it 's hard to add to a building like that -- it 's a beautiful , minimalist , black steel building -- and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it 's a lot of acreage . 
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect from Portugal : Alvaro Siza . 
RSW : Why did you want that ? 
FG : I knew you 'd ask that question . 
It was intuitive . 
Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture . 
I visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work , and his early work had a resemblance to my early work . 
When I came out of college , I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California , and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that . 
I tried to understand that language as a beginning , as a place to jump off , and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it was n't ... 
I just stopped . 
I mean , Charlie Moore did a bunch of it , but it did n't feel good to me . 
Siza , on the other hand , continued in Portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language . 
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California and do a building . 
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they did n't pan out . 
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you . 
I 've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra , who does n't think architecture is art . 
Did you see that thing ? 
RSW : No . What did he say ? 
FG : He calls architecture " plumbing . " 
FG : Anyway , the Siza thing . 
It 's a richer experience . 
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians -- it 's similar to that I would imagine -- where you ... huh ? 
Audience : Liquid architecture . 
FG : Liquid architecture . 
Where you ... It 's like jazz : you improvise , you work together , you play off each other , you make something , they make something . 
And I think for me , it 's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city . 
RSW : Is it going to be near the current campus ? 
Or is it going to be down near ... 
FG : No , it 's near the current campus . 
Anyway , he 's that kind of patron . 
It 's not his money , of course . 
RSW : What 's his schedule on that ? 
FG : I do n't know . 
What 's the schedule , Richard ? 
Richard Koshalek : [ Unclear ] starts from 2004 . 
FG : 2004 . 
You can come to the opening . I 'll invite you . 
No , but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos , right ? 
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment , and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other 's work and play off each other , you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect . 
Like the Rockefeller Center model , which is kind of from another era . 
RSW : I found the most remarkable thing . 
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building , you go inside and there 'd be extraordinary spaces . 
I 'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED . 
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city . 
That was the surprise of going across the river , of going on the highway around it , of walking down the street and finding it . 
That was the real surprise of Bilbao . 
FG : But you know , Richard , most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know , you get up and you talk about your work , and it 's almost like you tell everybody you 're a good guy by saying , " Look , I 'm worried about the context , I 'm worried about the city , I 'm worried about my client , I worry about budget , that I 'm on time . " 
Blah , blah , blah and all that stuff . 
And it 's like cleansing yourself so that you can ... 
by saying all that , it means your work is good somehow . 
And I think everybody -- I mean that should be a matter of fact , like gravity . 
You 're not going to defy gravity . 
You 've got to work with the building department . 
If you do n't meet the budgets , you 're not going to get much work . 
If it leaks -- Bilbao did not leak . 
I was so proud . 
The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao . 
I met them in Bilbao . 
They came for three days . 
RSW : This is the computer building ? 
FG : Yeah , the computer building . 
They were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- I noticed they were looking under things and looking for things , and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden , you know ? 
People put buckets out ... 
I was clean . There was n't a bloody leak in the place , it was just fantastic . 
But you 've got to -- yeah , well up until then every building leaked , so this ... 
RSW : Frank had a sort of ... 
FG : Ask Miriam ! 
RW : ... sort of had a fame . His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while . 
FG : You 've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story , when the woman called and said , " Mr. Wright , I 'm sitting on the couch and the water 's pouring in on my head . " 
And he said , " Madam , move your chair . " 
So , some years later I was doing a building , a little house on the beach for Norton Simon , and his secretary , who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady , called me and said , " Mr. Simon 's sitting at his desk and the water 's coming in on his head . " 
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story . 
RSW : Did n't get a laugh . 
FG : No . Not now either . 
But my point is that ... and I call it the " then what ? " 
OK , you solved all the problems , you did all the stuff , you made nice , you loved your clients , you loved the city , you 're a good guy , you 're a good person ... 
and then what ? 
What do you bring to it ? 
And I think that 's what I 've always been interested in , is that -- which is a personal kind of expression . 
Bilbao , I think , shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city . 
That 's what reminded me of it . 
And I think that 's the issue , you know ; it 's the " then what " that most clients who hire architects -- most clients are n't hiring architects for that . 
They 're hiring them to get it done , get it on budget , be polite , and they 're missing out on the real value of an architect . 
RSW : At a certain point a number of years ago , people -- when Michael Graves was a fashion , before teapots ... 
FG : I did a teapot and nobody bought it . 
RSW : Did it leak ? 
FG : No . 
RSW : ... people wanted a Michael Graves building . 
Is that a curse , that people want a Bilbao building ? 
FG : Yeah . 
Since Bilbao opened , which is now four , five years , both Krens and I have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- China , Brazil , other parts of Spain -- to come in and do the Bilbao effect . 
And I 've met with some of these people . 
Usually I say no right away , but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well - intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings . 
In one case , I flew all the way to Malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city , and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port . 
I asked them what kind of building it was . 
" When you get here we 'll explain it . " Blah , blah , blah . 
So four of us went . 
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay , and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor . 
Each one was more beautiful than the other . 
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in Malaga . 
Just before going to lunch with the mayor , we went to the harbor commissioner . 
It was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here , and I was here , and my guys . 
We sat down , and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet . 
And the guy looked at me and said , " Now what can I do for you , Mr. Gehry ? " 
RSW : Oh , my God . 
FG : So , I got up . 
I said to my team , " Let 's get out of here . " 
We stood up , we walked out . 
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said , " You mean you 're not going to have lunch with the mayor ? " 
I said , " Nope . " 
" You 're not going to have dinner at all ? " 
They just brought us there to hustle this group , you know , to create a project . 
And we get a lot of that . 
Luckily , I 'm old enough that I can complain I ca n't travel . 
I do n't have my own plane yet . 
RSW : Well , I 'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it 's been very long . 
But let me just say a couple words . 
FG : Can I say something ? 
Are you going to talk about me or you ? 
RSW : Once a shit , always a shit ! 
FG : Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody , so ... 
RSW : You 're going to get one ! You 're going to get one ! 
I 'm going to make it for you ! 
FG : No , no . Wait a minute !

Laurie Santos : A monkey economy as irrational as ours 
I want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species . 
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious , and that 's that our species , Homo sapiens , is actually really , really smart -- like , ridiculously smart -- like you 're all doing things that no other species on the planet does right now . 
And this is , of course , not the first time you 've probably recognized this . 
Of course , in addition to being smart , we 're also an extremely vain species . 
So we like pointing out the fact that we 're smart . 
You know , so I could turn to pretty much any sage from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert to point out things like the fact that we 're noble in reason and infinite in faculties and just kind of awesome - er than anything else on the planet when it comes to all things cerebral . 
But of course , there 's a second observation about the human species that I want to focus on a little bit more , and that 's the fact that even though we 're actually really smart , sometimes uniquely smart , we can also be incredibly , incredibly dumb when it comes to some aspects of our decision making . 
Now I 'm seeing lots of smirks out there . 
Do n't worry , I 'm not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes . 
But of course , just in the last two years we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude . 
And we 've watched as the tools we uniquely make to pull the resources out of our environment kind of just blow up in our face . 
We 've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create -- these markets that were supposed to be foolproof -- we 've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes . 
But both of these two embarrassing examples , I think , do n't highlight what I think is most embarrassing about the mistakes that humans make , which is that we 'd like to think that the mistakes we make are really just the result of a couple bad apples or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog - worthy decisions . 
But it turns out , what social scientists are actually learning is that most of us , when put in certain contexts , will actually make very specific mistakes . 
The errors we make are actually predictable . 
We make them again and again . 
And they 're actually immune to lots of evidence . 
When we get negative feedback , we still , the next time we 're face with a certain context , tend to make the same errors . 
And so this has been a real puzzle to me as a sort of scholar of human nature . 
What I 'm most curious about is , how is a species that 's as smart as we are capable of such bad and such consistent errors all the time ? 
You know , we 're the smartest thing out there , why ca n't we figure this out ? 
In some sense , where do our mistakes really come from ? 
And having thought about this a little bit , I see a couple different possibilities . 
One possibility is , in some sense , it 's not really our fault . 
Because we 're a smart species , we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super , super complicated , sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand , even though we 've actually created them . 
We create financial markets that are super complex . 
We create mortgage terms that we ca n't actually deal with . 
And of course , if we are put in environments where we ca n't deal with it , in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up . 
If this was the case , we 'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error . 
We 'd actually just say , okay , let 's figure out the kinds of technologies we ca n't deal with , the kinds of environments that are bad -- get rid of those , design things better , and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be . 
But there 's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying , which is , maybe it 's not our environments that are messed up . 
Maybe it 's actually us that 's designed badly . 
This is a hint that I 've gotten from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors . 
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors exactly the same way , over and over again . 
It feels like we might almost just be built to make errors in certain ways . 
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about , because , if it 's us that 's messed up , it 's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it . 
We might just have to accept the fact that we 're error prone and try to design things around it . 
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at . 
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two ? 
What we need is a population that 's basically smart , can make lots of decisions , but does n't have access to any of the systems we have , any of the things that might mess us up -- no human technology , human culture , maybe even not human language . 
And so this is why we turned to these guys here . 
These are one of the guys I work with . This is a brown capuchin monkey . 
These guys are New World primates , which means they broke off from the human branch about 35 million years ago . 
This means that your great , great , great great , great , great -- with about five million " greats " in there -- grandmother was probably the same great , great , great , great grandmother with five million " greats " in there as Holly up here . 
You know , so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant , but albeit evolutionary , relative . 
The good news about Holly though is that she does n't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do . 
You know , she 's a smart , very cut creature , a primate as well , but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up . 
So she 's the perfect test case . 
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans ? 
Does she make the same mistakes as us ? 
Does she not learn from them ? And so on . 
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do . 
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago . 
We said , all right , let 's , you know , throw so problems at Holly , see if she messes these things up . 
First problem is just , well , where should we start ? 
Because , you know , it 's great for us , but bad for humans . 
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts . 
You know , where are we actually going to start with this ? 
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse , around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news , we said , hhmm , maybe we should actually start in the financial domain . 
Maybe we should look at monkey 's economic decisions and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do . 
Of course , that 's when we hit a sort second problem -- a little bit more methodological -- which is that , maybe you guys do n't know , but monkeys do n't actually use money . I know , you have n't met them . 
But this is why , you know , they 're not in the queue behind you at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know , they do n't do this stuff . 
So now we faced , you know , a little bit of a problem here . 
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money if they do n't actually use it ? 
So we said , well , maybe we should just , actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money . 
So that 's just what we did . 
What you 're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of of non - human currency . 
We were n't very creative at the time we started these studies , so we just called it a token . 
But this is the unit of currency that we 've taught our monkeys at Yale to actually use with humans , to actually buy different pieces of food . 
It does n't look like much -- in fact , it is n't like much . 
Like most of our money , it 's just a piece of metal . 
As those of you who 've taken currencies home from your trip know , once you get home , it 's actually pretty useless . 
It was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it . 
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures , they actually kind of picked them up , looked at them . 
They were these kind of weird things . 
But very quickly , the monkeys realized that they could actually hand these tokens over to different humans in the lab for some food . 
And so you see one of our monkeys , Mayday , up here doing this . 
This is A and B are kind of the points where she 's sort of a little bit curious about these things -- does n't know . 
There 's this waiting hand from a human experimenter , and Mayday quickly figures out , apparently the human wants this . 
Hands it over , and then gets some food . 
It turns out not just Mayday , all of our monkeys get good at trading tokens with human salesman . 
So here 's just a quick video of what this looks like . 
Here 's Mayday . She 's going to be trading a token for some food and waiting happily and getting her food . 
Here 's Felix , I think . He 's our alpha male ; he 's a kind of big guy . 
But he too waits patiently , gets his food and goes on . 
So the monkeys get really good at this . 
They 're surprisingly good at this with very little training . 
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own . 
The question is : is this anything like human money ? 
Is this a market at all , or did we just do a weird psychologist 's trick by getting monkeys to do something , looking smart , but not really being smart . 
And so we said , well , what would the monkeys spontaneously do if this was really their currency , if they were really using it like money ? 
Well , you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other . 
You might have them start paying attention to price , paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey token , as it were . 
Do the monkeys do anything like this ? 
And so our monkey marketplace was born . 
The way this works is that our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure . 
When they get a hankering for some treats , we actually allowed them a way out into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market . 
Upon entering the market -- it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because , as the monkeys entered the door of the market , a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here -- two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from . 
The salesmen were students from my lab . 
They dressed differently ; they were different people . 
And over time , they did basically the same thing so the monkeys could learn , you know , who sold what at what price -- you know , who was reliable , who was n't , and so on . 
And you can see that each of the experimenters is actually holding up a little , yellow food dish . 
and that 's what the monkey can for a single token . 
So everything costs one token , but as you can see , sometimes tokens buy more than others , sometimes more grapes than others . 
So I 'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like . 
Here 's a monkey - eye - view . Monkeys are shorter , so it 's a little short . 
But here 's Honey . 
She 's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently . 
All of a sudden the market opens . Here 's her choice : one grapes or two grapes . 
You can see Honey , very good market economist , goes with the guy who gives more . 
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two . 
So not just Honey , most of the monkeys went with guys who had more . 
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food . 
When we introduced sales , we saw the monkeys paid attention to that . 
They really cared about their monkey token dollar . 
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys ' data using economic tools , they basically matched , not just qualitatively , but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market . 
So much so that , if you saw the monkeys ' numbers , you could n't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market . 
And what we 'd really thought we 'd done is like we 'd actually introduced something that , at least for the monkeys and us , works like a real financial currency . 
Question is : do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do ? 
Well , we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might . 
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace was any evidence of saving -- you know , just like our own species . 
The monkeys entered the market , spent their entire budget and then went back to everyone else . 
The other thing we also spontaneously saw , embarrassingly enough , is spontaneous evidence of larceny . 
The monkeys would rip - off the tokens at every available opportunity -- from each other , often from us -- you know , things we did n't necessarily think we were introducing , but things we spontaneously saw . 
So we said , this looks bad . 
Can we actually see if the monkeys are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do ? 
One possibility is just kind of let the monkey financial system play out , you know , see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years . 
We were a little impatient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit . 
So we said , let 's actually give the monkeys the same kinds of problems that humans tend to get wrong in certain kinds of economic challenges , or certain kinds of economic experiments . 
And so , since the best way to see how people go wrong is to actually do it yourself , I 'm going to give you guys a quick experiment to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action . 
So imagine that right now I handed each and every one of you a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills . 
Take these , put it in your wallet and spend a second thinking about what you 're going to do with it . 
Because it 's yours now ; you can buy whatever you want . 
Donate it , take it , and so on . 
Sounds great , but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money . 
And here 's your choice : you can either be risky , in which case I 'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens . 
If it comes up heads , you 're going to get a thousand dollars more . 
If it comes up tails , you get nothing . 
So it 's a chance to get more , but it 's pretty risky . 
Your other option is a bit safe . Your just going to get some money for sure . 
I 'm just going to give you 500 bucks . 
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately . 
So see what your intuition is here . 
Most people actually go with the play - it - safe option . 
Most people say , why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure ? 
This seems like a good bet . I 'm going to go with that . 
You might say , eh , that 's not really irrational . 
People are a little risk - averse . So what ? 
Well , the " so what ? " comes when start thinking about the same problem set up just a little bit differently . 
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you 2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills . 
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before . 
Think about how you 'd feel sticking it in your wallet . 
And now imagine that I have you make another choice But this time , it 's a little bit worse . 
Now , you 're going to be deciding how you 're going to lose money , but you 're going to get the same choice . 
You can either take a risky loss -- so I 'll flip a coin . If it comes up heads , you 're going to actually lose a lot . 
If it comes up tails , you lose nothing , you 're fine , get to keep the whole thing -- or you could play it safe , which means you have to reach back into your wallet and give me five of those $ 100 bills , for certain . 
And I 'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there . 
So maybe you 're having the same intuitions as the subjects that were actually tested in this , which is when presented with these options , people do n't choose to play it safe . 
They actually tend to go a little risky . 
The reason this is irrational is that we 've given people in both situations the same choice . 
It 's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000 , or just 1,500 dollars with certainty . 
But people 's intuitions about how much risk to take varies depending on where they started with . 
So what 's going on ? 
Well , it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level . 
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms . 
You really have to do work to figure out , well , one option 's a thousand , 2,000 ; one is 1,500 . 
Instead , we find it very easy to think in very relative terms as options change from one time to another . 
So we think of things as , " Oh , I 'm going to get more , " or " Oh , I 'm going to get less . " 
This is all well and good , except that changes in different directions actually effect whether or not we think options are good or not . 
And this leads to the second bias , which economists have called loss aversion . 
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red . 
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money . 
And this means that sometimes we 'll actually switch our preferences to avoid this . 
What you saw in that last scenario is that subjects get risky because they want the small shot that there wo n't be any loss . 
That means when we 're in a risk mindset -- excuse me , when we 're in a loss mindset , we actually become more risky , which can actually be really worrying . 
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans . 
They 're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer -- because they 're evaluating them in relative terms . 
They 're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house -- because they do n't want to sell at a loss . 
The question we were interested in is whether the monkeys show the same biases . 
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market , would they do the same thing as people ? 
And so this is what we did , we gave the monkeys choices between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time -- or guys who were risky -- they did things differently half the time . 
And then we gave them options that were bonuses -- like you guys did in the first scenario -- so they actually have a chance more , or pieces where they were experiencing losses -- they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got . 
And so this is what this looks like . 
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen . 
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape , so it looks pretty good . 
But they 're going to give the monkeys bonuses . 
The guy on the left is a safe bonus . 
All the time , he adds one , to give the monkeys two . 
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus . 
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero . 
Sometimes the monkeys get two extra . 
For a big bonus , now they get three . 
But this is the same choice you guys just faced . 
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who 's going to do the same thing on every trial , or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky , but big , bonus , but risk the possibility of getting no bonus . 
People here played it safe . 
Turns out , the monkeys play it safe too . 
Qualitatively and quantitatively , they choose exactly the same way as people , when tested in the same thing . 
You might say , well , maybe the monkeys just do n't like risk . 
Maybe we should see how they do with losses . 
And so we ran a second version of this . 
Now , the monkeys meet two guys who are n't giving them bonuses ; they 're actually giving them less than they expect . 
So they look like they 're starting out with a big amount . 
These are three grapes ; the monkey 's really psyched for this . 
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect . 
They guy on the left is a safe loss . 
Every single time , he 's going to take one of these away and give the monkeys just two . 
the guy on the right is the risky loss . 
Sometimes he gives no loss , so the monkeys are really psyched , but sometimes he actually gives a big loss , taking away two to give the monkeys only one . 
And so what do the monkeys do ? 
Again , same choice ; they can play it safe for always getting two grapes every single time , or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three . 
The remarkable thing to us is that , when you give monkeys this choice , they do the same irrational thing that people do . 
They actually become more risky depending on how the experimenters started . 
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too are evaluating things in relative terms and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains . 
So what does all of this mean ? 
Well , what we 've shown is that , first of all , we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency , and they do very similar things with it . 
They do some of the smart things we do , some of the kind of not so nice things we do , like steal it and so on . 
But they also do some of the irrational things we do . 
They systematically get things wrong and in the same ways that we do . 
This is the first take - home message of the Talk , which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought , oh , I 'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser . 
They 're way cuter than the one at ... you know -- Do n't do that ; they 're probably going to be just as dumb as the human one you already have . 
So , you know , a little bad -- Sorry , sorry , sorry . 
A little bad for monkey investors . 
But of course , you know , the reason you 're laughing is bad for humans too . 
Because we 've answered the question we started out with . 
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from . 
And we started with the hope that maybe we can sort of tweak our financial institutions , tweak our technologies to make ourselves better . 
But what we 've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that . 
In fact , they might be due to the very nature of our evolutionary history . 
You know , maybe it 's not just humans at the right side of this chain that 's duncey . 
Maybe it 's sort of duncey all the way back . 
And this , if we believe the capuchin monkey results , means that these duncey strategies might be 35 million years old . 
That 's a long time for a strategy to potentially get changed around -- really , really old . 
What do we know about other old strategies like this ? 
Well , one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome . 
You know , think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things , fatty things like cheesecake . 
You ca n't just shut that off . 
You ca n't just look at the dessert cart as say , " No , no , no . That looks disgusting to me . " 
We 're just built differently . 
We 're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after . 
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions . 
When you 're watching your stocks plummet into the red , when you 're watching your house price go down , you 're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms . 
This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly , that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome . 
So that 's the bad news . The question is : is there any good news ? 
I 'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news . 
Well , the good news , I think , is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk , which is that humans are not only smart ; we 're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom . 
We 're so good at overcoming our biological limitations -- you know , I flew over here in an airplane . 
I did n't have to try to flap my wings . 
I 'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you . 
I do n't have to rely on my own near - sightedness . 
We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means , seemingly pretty easily . 
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations . 
And here 's the rub . 
It was Camus who once said that , " Man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is . " 
But the irony is that it might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them . 
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations , not necessarily as unovercomable , but to recognize them , accept them and then use the world of design to actually figure them out . 
That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be . 
Thank you .

Mike Biddle : We can recycle plastic 
I 'm a garbage man . 
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man , because I absolutely hate waste . 
I hope , within the next 10 minutes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life . 
And I 'd like to start at the very beginning . 
Think back when you were just a kid . 
How did look at the stuff in your life ? 
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules : It 's my stuff if I saw it first . 
The entire pile is my stuff if I 'm building something . 
The more stuff that 's mine , the better . 
And of course , it 's your stuff if it 's broken . 
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry , it 's become pretty clear to me that we do n't necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults . 
And let me tell you why I have that perspective . 
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people 's discarded stuff . 
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff , but it 's a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent . 
In fact , the United Nations estimates that there 's about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that 's one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream . 
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth , that number well more than doubles . 
And of course , the more developed the country , the bigger these mountains . 
Now when you see these mountains , most people think of garbage . 
We see above - ground mines . 
And the reason we see mines is because there 's a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place . 
And it 's becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams . 
Because as we 've heard all week at TED , the world 's getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff . 
And of course , they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted . 
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ? 
It 's mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals . 
And the metals , we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world . 
And the plastics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract . 
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we 're already starting to see today . 
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end - of - life stuff and starting to recycle our end - of - life stuff , particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner . 
Most of what 's extracted from our end - of - life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals . 
To put that in perspective -- and I 'm using steel as a proxy here for metals , because it 's the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler , probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose . 
Plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered . 
In fact , it 's more like five percent . 
Most of it 's incinerated or landfilled . 
Now most people think that 's because plastics are a throw - away material , have very little value . 
But actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel . 
And there 's more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel . 
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ? 
Well it 's predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another . 
They have very different densities . 
They have different electrical and magnetic properties . 
And they even have different colors . 
So it 's very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials . 
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range . 
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties . 
And any plastic can be any color , as you probably well know . 
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply do n't work for plastics . 
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say , particularly from the United States , where we do n't have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low - cost recycling . 
People , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff . 
They extract what they can , which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they ca n't recover , which is , again , mostly the plastics . 
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here . 
And they extract the metals by hand . 
Now while this may be the low - economic - cost solution , this is certainly not the low - environmental or human health - and - safety solution . 
I call this environmental arbitrage . 
And it 's not fair , it 's not safe and it 's not sustainable . 
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way , those other methods do n't lead to the recovery of plastics , obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics . 
This is just one example . 
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai , India . 
They store the plastics on the roofs . 
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these , and people try very hard to separate the plastics , by color , by shape , by feel , by any technique they can . 
And sometimes they 'll resort to what 's known as the " burn and sniff " technique where they 'll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic . 
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way . 
And by the way , please do n't try this technique at home . 
So what are we to do about this space - age material , at least what we used to call a space - aged material , these plastics ? 
Well I certainly believe that it 's far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke . 
So about 20 years ago , I literally started in my garage tinkering around , trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other , and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends , in the mining world actually , and in the plastics world , and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world . 
Because after all , we 're doing above - ground mining . 
And we eventually broke the code . 
This is the last frontier of recycling . 
It 's the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth . 
And we finally figured out how to do it . 
And in the process , we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics . 
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals . 
You breakdown the molecules , you recombine them in very specific ways , to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day . 
We said , there 's got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics . 
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well . 
Well a good place to start is with waste . 
It certainly does n't cost as much as oil , and it 's plentiful , as I hope that you 've been able to see from the photographs . 
And because we 're not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them , we 're using a mining approach to extract the materials . 
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment . 
We have enormous energy savings . 
I do n't know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way . 
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life , our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them . 
And we make a drop - in replacement for that plastic that 's made from petrochemicals . 
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings . 
They get to close the loop with their products . 
And they get to make more sustainable products . 
In the short time period I have , I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this . 
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits . 
They recover the metals and leave behind what 's called shredder residue -- it 's their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials , but predominantly plastics . 
We take out the things that are n't plastics , such as the metals they missed , carpeting , foam , rubber , wood , glass , paper , you name it . 
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately . 
And it goes in the first part of our process here , which is more like traditional recycling . 
We 're sieving the material , we 're using magnets , we 're using air classification . 
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point . 
At the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics . 
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi - step separation process begins . 
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail . 
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics , not only by type , but by grade . 
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic : one type , one grade . 
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material . 
We blend it in 50,000-lb . blending silos . 
We push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti - like plastic strands . 
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets . 
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry . 
This is the same material that you would get from oil . 
And today , we 're producing it from your old stuff , and it 's going right back into your new stuff . 
So now , instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke , you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products , in your office , or back at work in your home . 
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic , replacing virgin plastic , to make their new products . 
So I hope I 've changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life . 
We took our clues from mother nature . 
Mother nature wastes very little , reuses practically everything . 
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that 's a label I 've always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form , until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time . 
And finally , I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to : " If it 's broken , it 's my stuff . " 
Thank you for your time .

Edward Burtynsky on manufactured landscapes 
Walk around for four months with three wishes , and all the ideas will start to percolate up . 
I think everybody should do it -- think that you 've got three wishes . 
And what would you do ? It 's actually a great exercise to really drill down to the things that you feel are important , and really reflect on the world around us . 
And thinking that , can an individual actually do something , or come up with something , that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference ? 
Inspired by nature -- that 's the theme here . 
And I think , quite frankly , that 's where I started . 
I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian . 
We have this Great North . And there was a pretty small population , and my father was an avid outdoorsman . 
So I really had a chance to experience that . 
And I could never really understand exactly what it was , or how it was informing me . 
But what I think it was telling me is that we are this transient thing that 's happening , and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines , the untouched forest that I was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that geological time , that this has gone on for a long time , and we 're experiencing it in a different way . 
And that , to me , was a reference point that I think I needed to have to be able to make the work that I did . 
And I did go out , and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring , along a roadside . 
This rebirth of grass . And then I went out for years trying to photograph the pristine landscape . 
But as a fine - art photographer I somehow felt that it would n't catch on out there , that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine - art career . 
And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture , or something of that nature , and I could n't get away from it . 
So I started to think of , how can I rethink the landscape ? 
I decided to rethink the landscape as the landscape that we 've transformed . 
I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania , and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway . 
And I ended up in a town called Frackville . 
I got out of the car , and I stood up , and it was a coal - mining town . I did a 360 turnaround , and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I 've ever seen . 
Totally transformed by man . 
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this , and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that I could find . 
And that became the baseline of what I was doing . 
And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto , and not have to re - invent myself -- that this theme was large enough to become a life 's work , to become something that I could sink my teeth into and just research and find out where these industries are . 
And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks , which I kind of missed , was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in . 
Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs -- to get into that place to make those photographs , and if it was n't for those people letting me in at the heads of those corporations , I would have never made this body of work . 
So in that respect , to me , I 'm not against the corporation . 
I own a corporation . I work with them , and I feel that we all need them and they 're important . 
But I am also for sustainability . 
So there 's this thing that is pulling me in both directions . 
And I 'm not making an indictment towards what 's happening here , but it is a slow progression . 
So I started thinking , well , we live in all these ages of man : the Stone Age , and the Iron Age , and the Copper Age . 
And these ages of man are still at work today . 
But we 've become totally disconnected from them . 
There 's something that we 're not seeing there . 
And it 's a scary thing as well . Because when we start looking at the collective appetite for our lifestyles , and what we 're doing to that landscape -- that , to me , is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate . 
And through my photographs , I 'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work , and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image . 
Not to say , " Oh my God , what is it ? " but to be challenged by it -- to say , " Wow , this is beautiful , " on one level , but on the other level , " This is scary . I should n't be enjoying it . " 
Like a forbidden pleasure . And it 's that forbidden pleasure that I think is what resonates out there , and it gets people to look at these things , and it gets people to enter it . And it also , in a way , defines kind of what I feel , too -- that I 'm drawn to have a good life . 
I want a house , and I want a car . 
But there 's this consequence out there . 
And how do I begin to have that attraction , repulsion ? 
It 's even in my own conscience I 'm having it , and here in my work , I 'm trying to build that same toggle . 
These things that I photographed -- this tire pile here had 45 million tires in it . It was the largest one . 
It was only about an hour - and - a - half away from me , and it caught fire about four years ago . It 's around Westley , California , around Modesto . 
And I decided to start looking at something that , to me , had -- if the earlier work of looking at the landscape had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature , in the recycling work that you 're seeing here was starting to point to a direction . To me , it was our redemption . 
That in the recycling work that I was doing , I 'm looking for a practice , a human activity that is sustainable . 
That if we keep putting things , through industrial and urban existence , back into the system -- if we keep doing that -- we can continue on . 
Of course , listening at the conference , there 's many , many things that are coming . Bio - mimicry , and there 's many other things that are coming on stream -- nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having to go into that landscape and tear it apart . 
And we all look forward to those things . 
But in the meantime , these things are scaling up . 
These things are continuing to happen . 
What you 're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh , so I started to move away from North America ; I started to look at our world globally . 
These images of Bangladesh came out of a radio program I was listening to . 
They were talking about Exxon Valdez , and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers because of the insurance industries . 
And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned , and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle . 
And I thought , " My God , would n't that be something ? " 
To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand , literally , in third - world countries . 
So originally I was going to go to India . 
And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there , and then I was able to get into Bangladesh , and saw for the first time a third world , a view of it , that I had never actually thought was possible . 
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin -- people everywhere -- the pollution was intense , and the working conditions were horrible . 
Here you 're looking at some oil fields in California , some of the biggest oil fields . And again , I started to think that -- there was another epiphany -- that the whole world I was living in was a result of having plentiful oil . 
And that , to me , was again something that I started building on , and I continued to build on . 
So this is a series I 'm hoping to have ready in about two or three years , under the heading of " The Oil Party . " 
Because I think everything that we 're involved in -- our clothing , our cars , our roads , and everything -- are directly a result . 
I 'm going to move to some pictures of China . 
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago , and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind , not to mention that China , as well , has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around . 
I came out of a blue - collar town , a GM town , and my father worked at GM , so I was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work . But you know , to see China and the scale at which it 's evolving , is quite something . 
So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam , and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man . 
Most of the engineers around the world left the project because they said , " It 's just too big . " 
In fact , when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago , they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning . 
It took fifteen days to fill it . 
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long , one of the largest reservoirs ever created . 
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full - size cities up out of the reservoir , and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships . 
This is a " before and after . " So that was before . 
And this is like 10 weeks later , demolished by hand . 
I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite , everything else was by hand . That was 10 weeks later . 
And this gives you an idea . 
And it was all the people who lived in those homes , were the ones that were actually taking it apart and working , and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart . 
And these are some of the images from that . 
So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam , looking at that massive transformation of a landscape . 
And it looks like a bombed - out landscape , but it is n't . 
What it is , it 's a landscape that is an intentional one . 
This is a need for power , and they 're willing to go through this massive transformation , on this scale , to get that power . 
And again , it 's actually a relief for what 's going on in China because I think on the table right now , there 's 27 nuclear power stations to be built . 
There has n't been one built in North America for 20 years because of the " NIMBY " problem -- " Not In My BackYard . " 
But in China they 're saying , " No , we 're putting in 27 in the next 10 years . " 
And coal - burning furnaces are going in there for hydroelectric power literally weekly . 
So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems . 
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges -- a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost ; some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that . 
And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated , depending on whose statistics you 're looking at . 
And this is what they were building . 
This is Wushan , one of the largest cities that was relocated . 
This is the town hall for the city . 
And again , the rebuilding of the city -- to me , it was sad to see that they did n't really grab a lot of , I guess , what we know here , in terms of urban planning . 
There were no parks ; there were no green spaces . 
Very high - density living on the side of a hill . 
And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up , but somehow were not connecting with them . 
Here is a sign that , translated , says , " Obey the birth control law . 
Build our science , civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth . " 
So here , if you look at this poster , it has all the trappings of Western culture . 
You 're seeing the tuxedos , the bouquets . 
But what 's really , to me , frightening about the picture and about this billboard is the refinery in the background . 
So it 's like marrying up all the things that we have and it 's an adaptation of our way of life , full stop . 
And again , when you start seeing that kind of embrace , and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle with a very , very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle with a much higher footprint , it starts to become very sobering . 
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong -- and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country . 
And there 's about 130 million people in migration trying to get into urban centers at all times , and in the next 10 to 15 years , are expecting another 400 to 500 million people to migrate into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers . 
The manufacturers are -- the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact that they all use the same color uniforms . 
So this is a pink uniform at this factory . It 's a shoe factory . 
And they have dorms for the workers . 
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms . 
This is one of the biggest shoe factories , the Yuyuan shoe factory near Shenzhen . It has 90,000 employees making shoes . 
This is a shift change , one of three . 
There 's two factories of this scale in the same town . 
This is one with 45,000 , so every lunch , there 's about 12,000 coming through for lunch . 
They sit down ; they have about 20 minutes . 
The next round comes in . It 's an incredible workforce that 's building there . Shanghai -- I 'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai , and this is a whole area that will be flattened and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years . 
What 's also happening in Shanghai is -- China is changing because this would n't have happened five years ago , for instance . This is a holdout . 
They 're called dengzahoos -- they 're like pin tacks to the ground . 
They wo n't move . They 're not negotiating . 
They 're not getting enough , so they 're not going to move . 
And so they 're holding off until they get a deal with them . 
And they 've been actually quite successful in getting better deals because most of them are getting a raw deal . 
They 're being put out about two hours -- the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years , or maybe even thousands of years , are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas outside of Shanghai . But these are a whole series of guys holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai . 
Probably the largest urban - renewal project , I think , ever attempted on the planet . 
And then the embrace of the things that they 're replacing it with -- again , one of my wishes , and I never ended up going there , was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house . 
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something , and these are called the villas . 
And also , like right now , they 're just moving . 
The scaffolding is still on , and this is an e - waste area , and if you looked in the foreground on the big print , you 'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they 're all recycling . 
So the industry 's already growing around these new developments . 
This is a five - level bridge in Shanghai . 
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it 's exploding on a level that I do n't think any city has experienced . 
In fact , even Shenzhen , the economic zone -- one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people , and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million . 
So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which -- this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen . 
There 's 9,000 of them here , and they 're being built for most of the big cities , Beijing and Shanghai , Shenzhen . 
And this is n't even the domestic car market ; this is the taxi market . 
And what we would see here as a suburban development -- a similar thing , but they 're all high - rises . 
So they 'll put 20 or 40 up at a time , and they just go up in the same way as a single - family dwelling would go up here in an area . 
And the density is quite incredible . 
And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out is that when I saw these kinds of buildings , I was shocked to see that they 're not using a central air - conditioning system ; every window has an air conditioner in it . 
And I 'm sure there are people here who probably know better than I do about efficiencies , but I ca n't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale . 
And when you start looking at that , and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai , it 's literally a forest of skyscrapers . 
It 's breathtaking , in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming . 
And you can see in the foreground of this picture , it 's still one of the last areas that was being held up . 
Right now that 's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago -- and high - rises are now going up into that central spot . 
So a skyscraper is built , literally , overnight in Shanghai . 
Most recently I went in , and I started looking at some of the biggest industries in China . 
And this is Baosteel , right outside of Shanghai . 
This is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers . 
It 's an incredibly massive operation , I think 15,000 workers , five cupolas , and the sixth one 's coming in here . 
So they 're building very large blast furnaces to try to deal with the demand for steel in China . 
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot . 
And again , looking at these images , there 's this constant , like , haze that you 're seeing . 
This is going to show you , real time , an assembler . It 's a circuit breaker . 
10 hours a day at this speed . 
I think one of the issues that we here are facing with China , is that they 're using a lot of the latest production technology . 
In that one , there were 400 people that worked on the floor . 
And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers , and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes , and picked this one woman . 
And it was just lightning fast ; the way she was working was almost unbelievable . 
But that is the trick that they 've got right now , that they 're winning with , is that they 're using all the latest technologies and extrusion machines , and bringing all the components into play , but the assembly is where they 're actually bringing in -- the country workers are very willing to work . They want to work . 
There 's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs . 
That condition 's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years if they realize what they want , which is , you know , 400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities . 
In this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw ; this is a shot of it . 
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field . 
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot . 
It took me five fake tries because they were just going . To slow them down was literally impossible . 
They were just wound up doing these things all day long , until the manager had to , with a stern voice , say , " Okay , everybody freeze . " 
It was n't too bad , but they 're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate . 
This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk , an oil byproduct . 
And what you 're seeing here is , again , one of the most state - of - the - art textile mills . 
There are 500 of these machines ; they 're worth about 200,000 dollars each . 
So you have about 12 people running this , and they 're just inspecting it -- and they 're just walking the lines . 
The machines are all running , absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are . 
And I started getting in further and further into the factories . 
And that 's a diptych . I do a lot of pairings to try and get the sense of scale in these places . 
This is a line where they get the threads and they wind the threads together , pre - going into the textile mills . 
Here 's something that 's far more labor - intensive , which is the making of shoes . 
This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor . 
The company itself had about 10,000 employees , and they 're doing domestic shoes . 
It was very hard to get into the international companies because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas , and that 's very hard to get . 
And they do n't want to let me in . 
But the domestic was much easier to do . 
It just gives you a sense of , again -- and that 's where , really , the whole migration of jobs started going over to China and making the shoes . Nike was one of the early ones . 
It was such a high labor component to it that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market . 
This is a high - tech mobile phone : Bird mobile phone , one of the largest mobile makers in China . 
I think mobile phone companies are popping up , literally , on a weekly basis , and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones . 
This is a textile where they 're doing shirts -- Youngor , the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China . 
And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms . 
Everything is very efficient . 
While setting up this shot , people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch . 
This was one of the biggest factories I 've ever seen . 
They make coffeemakers here , the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers -- they make 20 million of them in the world . 
There 's 21,000 employees . This one factory -- and they had several of them -- is half a kilometer long . 
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago , so you 're the first ones to be seeing these , these new factory pictures I 've taken . 
So it 's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places . 
The other aspect of what 's happening in China is that there 's a real need for materials there . 
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here are being recycled and taken to China by ships . 
That 's cubed metal . This is armatures , electrical armatures , where they 're getting the copper and the high - end steel from electrical motors out , and recycling them . 
This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley . 
But this is what happens to most of the computers . 
Fifty percent of the world 's computers end up in China to be recycled . 
It 's referred to as " e - waste " there . 
And it is a bit of a problem . The way they recycle the boards is that they actually use the coal briquettes , which are used all through China , but they heat up the boards , and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components . 
They 're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components . 
But the toxic smells -- when you come into a town that 's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards , you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there . 
Here 's another operation . It 's all cottage industries , so it 's not big places -- it 's all in people 's front porches , in their backyards , even in their homes they 're burning boards , if there 's a concern for somebody coming by -- because it is considered in China to be illegal , doing it , but they ca n't stop the product from coming in . 
This portrait -- I 'm not usually known for portraits , but I could n't resist this one , where she 's been through Mao , and she 's been through the Great Leap Forward , and the Cultural Revolution , and now she 's sitting on her porch with this e - waste beside her . It 's quite something . 
This is a road where it 's been shored up by computer boards in one of the biggest towns where they 're recycling . 
So that 's the photographs that I wanted to show you . 
I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls . 
They 've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I 've been thinking . 
One 's Megan , the one of the right , and Katja there . 
And to me the whole notion -- the things I 'm photographing are out of a great concern about the scale of our progress and what we call progress . 
And as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it 's palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems , I 'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect . 
And it is n't something that is n't just affecting our world , but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there 's a growing footprint that 's happening in Asia , and is growing at a rapid , rapid rate , and so I do n't think we can equalize it . So ultimately the strategy , I think , here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution , because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well . 
So part of my thinking , and part of my wishes , is sitting with these thoughts in mind , and thinking about , " How is their life going to be when they want to have children , or when they 're ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever , 15 years from now ? " 
And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking -- in my work , and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes . 
Wish one : world - changing . I want to use my images to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability . 
And it is through communications today that I believe that that is not an unreal idea . 
Oh , and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind , hitch it onto something . I did n't want a wish just to start from nowhere . 
One of them I 'm starting from almost nothing , but the other one , I wanted to find out what 's going on that 's working right now . 
And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog , and that blog is now being visited by close to half - a - million people a month . 
And it just started about 14 months ago . 
And the beauty of what 's going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like . 
What they 're doing there is that they 're not -- I think the environmental movement has failed in that it 's used the stick too much ; it 's used the apocalyptic tone too much ; it has n't sold the positive aspects of being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out . 
Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog is about positive movements , about how to change our world in a better way , quickly . 
And it 's looking at technology , and it 's looking at new energy - saving devices , and it 's looking at how to rethink and how to re - strategize the movement towards sustainability . 
And so for me , one of the things that I thought would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting the Worldchanging.com website . 
Some of you might know , he 's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I are working on some layouts . And this is still in preliminary stages ; these are n't the finals . But these images , with Worldchanging.com , can be placed into any kind of media . 
They could be posted through the Web ; they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter , or anything of that nature . 
So we 're looking at this as trying to build out . 
And what we ended up discussing was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text , and the text is blasted all over . 
What was unusual , according to Stephen , is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image . 
And so in this case , because it 's about a lot of these images and what they represent , and the kinds of questions they bring up , that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say , " Well , what 's Worldchanging.com , with these images , have to do ? " 
And hopefully inspire people to go to that website . 
So Worldchanging.com , and building that blog , and it is a blog , and I 'm hoping that it is n't -- I do n't see it as the kind of blog where we 're all going to follow each other to death . 
This one is one that will spoke out , and will go out , and to start reaching . Because right now there 's conversations in India , in China , in South America -- there 's entries coming from all around the world . 
I think there 's a chance to have a dialogue , a conversation about sustainability at Worldchanging.com . 
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic . 
Wish two is more of the bottom - up , ground - up one that I 'm trying to work with . 
And this one is : I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on , and invent ideas on , sustainability . 
And one of the things that came out -- Allison , who actually nominated me , said something earlier on in a brainstorming . She said that recycling in Canada had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six . 
And you think about it , you know , grade four -- my wife and I , we say age seven is the age of reason , so they 're into the age of reason . And they 're pre - puberty . 
So it 's this great window where they actually are -- you can influence them . You know what happens at puberty ? 
You know , we know that from earlier presentations . 
So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids to start driving home ideas . Let them understand what sustainability is , and that they have a vested interest in it to happen . 
And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize , so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings , and the rest is going to be to manage this project , but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands . 
But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic was to create these -- call them " prize targets . " 
And so one could be for the best sustainable idea for an in - school project , the best one for a household project , or it could be the best community project for sustainability . 
And I also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for " In My World . " And what would happen -- it 's a scalable thing . And if we can get people to put in things -- whether it 's equipment , like a media lab , or money to make the prize significant enough -- and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools , or schools that are with kids that age , and make it a wide - open competition for them to go after those prizes and to submit them . 
And the prize has to be a verifiable thing , so it 's not about just ideas . 
The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them , but the actual things have to be verifiable . 
In that way , what 's happening is that we 're motivating a certain age group to start thinking . 
And they 're going to push that up , from the bottom -- up into , I believe , into the households . And parents will be reacting to it , and trying to help them with the projects . 
And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability in a very positive way , and starts to teach them . They know about recycling now , but they do n't really , I think , get sustainability in all the things , and the energy footprint , and how that matters . 
And to teach them , to me , would be a fantastic wish , and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into . 
And again , in " In My World , " the competition -- we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it . 
And I like the words , " in my world , " because it gives possession of the world to the person who 's doing it . 
It is my world ; it 's not someone else 's . I want to help it ; I want to do something with it . So I think it has a great opportunity to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas , I think , come from kids -- and engage their imagination into a project , and do something for schools . 
I think all schools could use extra equipment , extra cash -- it 's going to be an incentive for them to do that . 
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where we could possibly put in some promotion for " In My World . " 
And wish three is : Imax film . So I was told I should do one for myself , and I 've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something . 
And the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas I 'm playing with -- when I first saw an Imax film , I almost immediately thought , " There 's a real resonance between what I 'm trying to do and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer . " 
And I think there 's a real possibility to reach new audiences if I had a chance . 
So I 'm looking , really , for a mentor , because I just had my birthday . 
I 'm 50 , and I do n't have time to go back to school right now -- I 'm too busy . So I need somebody who can put me on a quick catch - up course on how to do something like that , and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this . 
That would be fantastic . So those are my three wishes .

Join Rev. James Forbes at the dinner table of his Southern childhood , where his mother and father taught him what compassion really means day to day -- sharing with those who need love .

Rev. James Forbes : Compassion at the dinner table 
Compassion : what does it look like ? 
Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street in Raleigh , North Carolina , where I grew up . 
If you come in you will see us : evening time , at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled -- at the point when dinner is ready to be served . 
Since mom had eight kids , sometimes she said she could n't tell who was who and where they were . 
Before we could eat , she would ask , " Are all the children in ? " 
And if someone happened to be missing , we would have to , we say , " Fix a plate " for that person , put it in the oven , then we could say grace , and we could eat . 
Also , while we were at the table , there was a ritual in our family : when something significant had happened for any one of us -- whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA , or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination , or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent -- the ritual at the family was , once the announcement is made , we must take five , ten minutes to do what we call " make over " that person -- that is , to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way . 
For when one is honored , all are honored . 
Also , we had to make a report on our extended " visited " members , that is , extended members of the family , sick and elderly , shut in . 
My task was , at least once a week , to visit Mother Lassiter who lived on East Street , Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue , and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road . 
Why ? Because they were old and infirm , and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything . 
For mom said , " To be family , is to care and share and to look out for one another . 
They are our family . " 
And , of course , sometimes there was a bonus for going . 
They would offer sweets or money . 
Mom says , " If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them , you must always say , ' Nothing . ' And if they insist , say , ' Whatever you mind to give me . ' " This was the nature of being at that table . 
In fact , she indicated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family , but she said , " Even God will smile , and when God smiles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . " 
So , at the table at 915 , I learned something about compassion . 
Of course , it was a minister 's family , so we had to add God into it . 
And so , I came to think that mama eternal , mama eternal , is always wondering : Are all the children in ? 
And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing , we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world . 
Now , it was not always wonderful at that table . 
Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion . 
It was Christmas , and at our family , oh , what a morning . 
Christmas morning , where we open up our gifts , where we have special prayers , and where we get to the old upright piano and we would sing carols . It was a very intimate moment . 
In fact , you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing , and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed , except that daddy messed it up . 
There was a member of his staff who did not have any place on that particular Christmas to celebrate . 
And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration . 
We thought he must be out of his mind . 
This is our time . This is intimate time . 
This is when we can just be who we are , and now we have this stuffy brother with his shirt and tie on , while we are still in our PJs . 
Why would daddy bring Elder Revels ? 
Any other time , but not to the Christmas celebration . 
And mom overheard us and said , " Well , you know what ? If you really understand the nature of this celebration , it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love . 
That 's what the celebration is all about . 
It 's time to make space , to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community . " 
So , we sucked up . 
But growing up at 915 , compassion was not a word to be debated ; it was a sensibility to how we are together . 
We are sisters and brothers united together . 
And , like Chief Seattle said , " We did not spin the web of life . 
We 're all strands in it . 
And whatever we do to the web , we do to ourselves . " 
Now that 's compassion . 
So , let me tell you , I kind of look at the world this way . 
I see pictures , and something says , " Now , that 's compassion . " 
A harvested field of grain , with some grain in the corners , reminding me of the Hebrew tradition that you may indeed harvest , but you must always leave some on the edges , just in case there 's someone who has not had the share necessary for good nurture . 
Talk about a picture of compassion . 
I see -- always , it stirs my heart -- a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. 
walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled , walking across the bridge and going into Selma . 
Just a photograph . 
Arm in arm for struggle . 
Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being . 
So , there 's another picture . Here , this one . I really do like this picture . 
When Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. was assassinated , that day , everybody in my community was upset . 
You heard about riots all across the land . 
Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis . 
This is the picture . They said , " It 's going to be too volatile for you to go . " 
He insisted , " I must go . " 
So , sitting on a flatbed truck , the elders of the community are there , and Bobby stands up and says to the people , " I have bad news for you . 
Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated . 
I know that you are angry , and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity to enter now into activities of revenge . But , " he said , " what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel . 
Because I had someone dear to me snatched away . 
I know how you feel . " 
And he said , " I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did . 
I allowed my anger , my bitterness , my grief to simmer a while , and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world , and we can do that together . " 
That 's a picture . Compassion ? I think I see it . 
I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor , and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world . 
He asked them to give a message , and they each read in their own language a central affirmation , and that was some version of the golden rule : " As you would that others would do unto you , do also unto them . " 
Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message . 
We are so connected that we must treat each other as if an action toward you is an action toward myself . 
One more picture while I 'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church : 9/11 . Last night at Chagrin Fall , a newspaperman and a television guy said , " That evening , when a service was held at the Riverside Church , we carried it on our station in this city . 
It was , " he said , " one of the most powerful moments of life together . 
We were all suffering . 
But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come , and you invited them . 
' Find out what it is in your tradition that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated , when we have been despised and rejected . ' And they all spoke out of their own traditions , a word about the healing power of solidarity , one with the other . " 
I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature , but I became a preacher . 
Now , as a preacher , I got a job . I got to preach the stuff , but I got to do it too . 
Or , as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks , " Some people preach the Gospel . 
I have to tangibilitate the Gospel . " 
So , the real issue is : How do you tangibilitate compassion ? 
How do you make it real ? 
My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal , and challenged me when I fell beneath it . 
In my tradition , there is a gift that we have made to other traditions -- to everybody around the world who knows the story of the " Good Samaritan . " 
Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity , random acts of kindness . 
But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly , you will discover that a question has been raised that leads to this parable . 
The question was : " What is the greatest commandment ? " 
And , according to Jesus , the word comes forth , " You must love yourself , you must love the Lord your God with all your heart , mind and soul , and your neighbor as yourself . " 
And then the person asked , " Well , what do you mean , ' neighbor ? ' " And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves , and how religious authorities went the other way , and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way ; but an unsuspecting , despised person came along , saw the man in need , provided oil and wine for his wounds , put him on his own transportation , and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper , " Take care of him . " 
And he said , " Here , this is the initial investment , but if needs continue , make sure that you provide them . 
And whatever else is needed , I will provide it and pay for it when I return . " 
This always seemed to me to be a deepening of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan . 
A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity , but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that , ' a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn , take care . 
I think maybe it 's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system and a commitment to do whatever is necessary -- that all God 's children would have their needs cared for , so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks , " In regards to health , are all the children in ? " And we could say yes . 
Oh , what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion . 
I recall that my work as a pastor has always involved caring for their spiritual needs ; being concerned for housing , for healthcare , for the prisoners , for the infirm , for children -- even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record where they started off , where they are going . 
To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs . 
But now , to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say , and to be a good American -- for me , is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care . 
Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic . 
I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street must be done around tables and rituals of faith until we become that family , that family together that understands the nature of our unity . 
We are one people together . 
So , let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion , and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history . 
We would decide to establish this charter of compassion . 
The reason it 's important is because this is a very special time in history . 
It is the time that , biblically , we would speak of as the day , or the year , of God 's favor . 
This is a season of grace . 
Unusual things are beginning to happen . 
Please pardon me , as a black man , for celebrating that the election of Obama was an unusual sign of the fact that it is a year of favor . 
And yet , there is so much more that needs to be done . 
We need to bring health and food and education and respect for all God 's citizens , all God 's children , remembering mama eternal . 
Now , let me close my comments by telling you that whenever I feel something very deeply , it usually takes the form of verse . 
And so I want to close with a little song . 
I close with this song -- it 's a children 's song -- because we are all children at the table of mama eternal . 
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly , this song will make sense , not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering , but to all who sign the charter for compassion . 
And this is why we do it . 
The song says , ♫ " I made heaven so happy today , ♫ ♫ Receiving God 's love and giving it away ♫ ♫ When I looked up , heaven smiled at me ♫ ♫ Now , I 'm so happy . Ca n't you see ? ♫ ♫ I 'm happy . Look at me . I 'm happy . Ca n't you see ? ♫ ♫ Sharing makes me happy , makes heaven happy too ♫ ♫ I 'm happy . Look at me . I 'm happy . Ca n't you see ? ♫ ♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you . ♫ That 's compassion .

Emmanuel Jal : The music of a war child 
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal . 
And I come from a long way . 
I 've been telling a story that has been so painful for me . 
It 's been a tough journey for me , traveling the world , telling my story in form of a book . 
And also telling it like now . 
And also , the easiest one was when I was doing it in form of a music . 
So I have branded myself as a war child . 
I 'm doing this because of an old lady in my village now , who have lost her children . 
There is no newspaper to cover her pain , and what she wants to change in this society . 
And I 'm doing it for a young man who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice because he ca n't write . 
Or there is no Internet , like Facebook , MySpace , YouTube , for them to talk . 
Also one thing that kept me pushing this story , this painful stories out , the dreams I have , sometimes , is like the voices of the dead , that I have seen would tell me , " Do n't give up . Keep on going . " 
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it , because I did n't know what I was putting myself into . 
Well I was born in the most difficult time , when my country was at war . 
I saw my village burned down . 
The world that meant a lot to me , I saw it vanish in my face . 
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five . 
My mother was claimed by the war . 
My brothers and sisters were scattered . 
And up to now , me and my father were detached and I still have issues with him . 
Seeing people die every day , my mother crying , it 's like I was raised in a violence . 
And that made me call myself a war child . 
And not only that , when I was eight I became a child soldier . 
I did n't know what was the war for . 
But one thing I knew was an image that I saw that stuck in my head . 
When I went to the training camp I say , " I want to kill as many Muslims , and as many Arabs , as possible . " 
The training was n't easy , but that was the driving force , because I wanted to revenge for my family . 
I wanted to revenge for my village . 
Luckily now things have changed because I came to discover the truth . 
What was actually killing us was n't the Muslims , was n't the Arabs . 
It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system , and using religion to get what they want to get out of us , which is the oil , the diamond , the gold and the land . 
So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose : should I continue to hate , or let it go ? 
So I happened to forgive . Now I sing music with the Muslims . I dance with them . 
I even had a movie out called " War Child , " funded by Muslim people . 
So that pain has gone out . 
But my story is huge . 
So I 'm just going to go into a different step now , which is easier for me . 
I 'm going to give you poem called " Forced to Sin , " which is from my album " War Child . " 
I talk about my story . 
One of the journey that I tread when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food and we were like around 400 . 
And only 16 people survived that journey . 
So I hope you 're going to hear this . 
My dreams are like torment . 
My every moment . 
Voices in my brain , of friends that was slain . 
Friends like Lual who died by my side , of starvation . 
In the burning jungle , and the desert plain . 
Next was I , but Jesus heard my cry . 
As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh of my comrade , he gave me comfort . 
We used to raid villages , stealing chickens , goats and sheeps , anything we could eat . 
I knew it was rude , but we needed food . 
And therefore I was forced to sin , forced to sin to make a living , forced to sin to make a living . 
Sometimes you got ta lose to win . 
Never give up . Never give in . 
Left home at the age of seven . 
One year later , live with an AK-47 by my side . 
Slept with one eye open wide . 
Run , duck , play dead and hide . 
I 've seen my people die like flies . 
But I 've never seen a dead body , at least one that I 've killed . 
But still as I wonder , I wo n't go under . 
Guns barking like lightning and thunder . 
As a child so young and tender , Words I ca n't forget I still remember . 
I saw sergeant command raising his hand , no retreat , no surrender . 
I carry the banner of the trauma . 
War child , child without a mama , still fighting in the saga . 
Yet as I wage this new war I 'm not alone in this drama . 
No sit or stop , as I reach for the top I 'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop . 
I 'm on a fight , day and night . 
Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right . 
It 's like I 'm living a dream . 
First time I 'm feeling like a human being . 
Ah ! The children of Darfur . 
Your empty bellies on the telly and now it 's you that I 'm fighting for . 
Left home . 
Do n't even know the day I 'll ever return . 
My country is war - torn . 
Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns . 
So many people die that I do n't even cry no more . 
Ask God question , what am I here for . 
And why are my people poor . 
And why , why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write , I was learning how to fight . 
I ate snails , vultures , rabbits , snakes , and anything that had life . 
I was ready to eat . 
I know it 's a shame . But who is to be blamed ? 
That 's my story shared in the form of a lesson . 
Thank you . 
What energized me and kept me going is the music I do . 
I never saw anybody to tell my story to them so they could advise me or do therapy . 
So the music had been my therapy for me . 
It 's been where I actually see heaven , where I can be happy , where I can be a child again , in dances , through music . 
So one thing I know about music : music is the only thing that has power to enter your cell system , your mind , your heart , influence your soul and your spirit , and can even influence the way you live without even you knowing . 
Music is the only thing that can make you want to wake up your bed and shake your leg , without even wanting to do it . 
And so the power music has I normally compare to the power love when love does n't see a color . 
You know , if you fall in love with a frog , that 's it . 
One testimony about how I find music is powerful is when I was still a soldier back then . 
I hated the people in the north . 
But I do n't know why I do n't hate their music . 
So we party and dance to their music . 
And one thing that shocked me is one day they brought an Arab musician to come and entertain the soldiers . 
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music . 
But I had this question . 
So now I 'm doing music so I know what the power of music is . 
So what 's happening here ? 
I 've been in a painful journey . 
Today is day number 233 in which I only eat dinner . 
I do n't eat breakfast . No lunch . 
And I 've done a campaign called Lose to Win . 
Where I 'm losing so that I could win the battle that I 'm fighting now . 
So my breakfast , my lunch , I donate it to a charity that I founded because we want to build a school in Sudan . 
And I 'm doing this because also it 's a normal thing in my home , people eat one meal a day . 
Here I am in the West . I choose not to . 
So in my village now , kids there , they normally listen to BBC , or any radio , and they are waiting to know , the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast it means he got the money to build our school . 
And so I made a commitment . I say , " I 'm gon na not eat my breakfast . " 
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month , but I 've been humbled . 
So it 's taken me 232 days . 
And I said , " No stop until we get it . " 
And like it 's been done on Facebook , MySpace . 
The people are giving three dollars . 
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents . 
Somebody donated 20 cents online . 
I do n't know how they did it . 
But that moved me . 
And so , the importance of education to me is what I 'm willing to die for . 
I 'm willing to die for this , because I know what it can do to my people . 
Education enlighten your brain , give you so many chances , and you 're able to survive . 
As a nation we have been crippled . 
For so many years we have fed on aid . 
You see a 20-years - old , 30-years - old families in a refugee camps . 
They only get the food that drops from the sky , from the U.N. 
So these people , you 're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid . 
If anybody want to help us this is what we need . 
Give us tools . Give the farmers tools . 
It 's rain . Africa is fertile . They can grow the crops . 
Invest in education . 
Education so that we have strong institution that can create a revolution to change everything . 
Because we have all those old men that are creating wars in Africa . They will die soon . 
But if you invest in education then we 'll be able to change Africa . 
That 's what I 'm asking . 
So in order to do that , I founded a charter called Gua Africa , where we put kids in school . 
And now we have a couple in university . 
We have like 40 kids , ex - child soldiers mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support . 
And I said " I 'm going to put it in practice . " 
And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things . 
That 's what I want to do to change , to make a difference in the world . 
Well now , my time is going , so I want to sing a song . 
But I 'll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker called Emma McCune that made it possible for me to be here . 
I 'm gon na sing this song , just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference . 
She came to my country and saw the importance of education . 
She said the only way to help Sudan is to invest in the women , educating them , educating the children , so that they could come and create a revolution in this complex society . 
So she even ended up marrying a commander from the SPLA . 
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers . 
One of them happened to be me now . 
And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me . 
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma ? 
Audience : Yes ! 
Emmanuel Jal : All right .

Julia Sweeney on letting go of God 
On September 10 , the morning of my seventh birthday , I came downstairs to the kitchen , where my mother was washing the dishes and my father was reading the paper or something , and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway , and they said , " Hey , happy birthday ! " And I said , " I 'm seven . " 
And my father smiled and said , " Well , you know what that means , do n't you ? " 
And I said , " Yeah , that I 'm going to have a party and a cake and get a lot of presents ? " And my dad said , " Well , yes . 
But , more importantly , being seven means that you 've reached the age of reason , and you 're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man . " 
Now , I had heard this phrase , " age of reason , " before . 
Sister Mary Kevin had been bandying it about my second - grade class at school . But when she said it , the phrase seemed all caught up in the excitement of preparations for our first communion and our first confession , and everybody knew that was really all about the white dress and the white veil , and anyway , I had n't really paid all that much attention to that phrase , " age of reason . " 
So , I said , " Yeah , yeah , age of reason . What does that mean again ? " 
And my dad said , " Well , we believe in the Catholic Church that God knows that little kids do n't know the difference between right and wrong , but when you 're seven , you 're old enough to know better . 
So , you 've grown up , and reached the age of reason , and now God will start keeping notes on you and begin your permanent record . " 
And I said , " Oh . Wait a minute . You mean all that time , up till today , all that time I was so good , God did n't notice it ? " 
And my mom said , " Well , I noticed it . " 
And I thought , " How could I not have known this before ? 
How could it not have sunk in when they 'd been telling me ? 
All that being good and no real credit for it . 
And , worst of all , how could I not have realized this very important information until the very day that it was basically useless to me ? " 
So I said , " Well , Mom and Dad , what about Santa Claus ? 
I mean , Santa Claus knows if you 're naughty or nice , right ? " 
And my dad said , " Yeah , but , honey , I think that 's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas . " 
And my mother said , " Oh , Bob , stop it . Let 's just tell her . 
I mean , she 's seven . Julie , there is no Santa Claus . " 
Now , this was actually not that upsetting to me . 
My parents had this whole elaborate story about Santa Claus : how they had talked to Santa Claus himself and agreed that instead of Santa delivering our presents over the night of Christmas Eve , like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing Christmas morning , our family would give Santa more time . 
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass on Christmas morning , but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss . 
Which made me very suspicious . 
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents . 
I mean , my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style , and my mother 's handwriting was so close to Santa 's . 
Plus , why would Santa save time by having to loop back to our house after he 'd gone to everybody else 's ? 
There 's only one obvious conclusion to reach from this mountain of evidence : our family was too strange and weird for even Santa Claus to come visit , and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment , this humiliation of rejection by Santa , who was jolly -- but , let 's face it , he was also very judgmental . 
So , to find out that there was no Santa Claus at all was actually sort of a relief . 
I left the kitchen not really in shock about Santa , but rather I was just dumbfounded about how I could have missed this whole age of reason thing . 
It was too late for me , but maybe I could help someone else , someone who could use the information . 
They had to fit two criteria : they had to be old enough to be able to understand the whole concept of the age of reason , and not yet seven . 
The answer was clear : my brother Bill . He was six . 
Well , I finally found Bill about a block away from our house at this public school playground . It was a Saturday , and he was all by himself , just kicking a ball against the side of a wall . 
I ran up to him and said , " Bill ! 
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven , and then you 're capable of committing any and all sins against God and man . " And Bill said , " So ? " And then I said , " So , you 're six . You have a whole year to do anything you want to and God wo n't notice it . " And he said , " So ? " And I said , " So ? So everything ! " And I turned to run . I was so angry with him . 
But when I got to the top of the steps , I turned around dramatically and said , " Oh , by the way , Bill , there is no Santa Claus . " 
Now , I did n't know it at the time , but I really was n't turning seven on September 10 . 
For my 13th birthday , I planned a slumber party with all of my girlfriends , but a couple of weeks beforehand my mother took me aside and said , " I need to speak to you privately . 
September 10 is not your birthday . It 's October 10 . " And I said , " What ? " 
And she said , " Listen . The cut - off date to start kindergarten was September 15 . " 
" So , I told them that your birthday was on September 10 , and then I was n't sure that you were n't just going to go blab it all over the place , so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10 . 
But , Julie , you were so ready to start school , honey . You were so ready . " 
I thought about it , and when I was four , I was already the oldest of four children , and my mother even had another child to come , so what I think she understandably really meant was that she was so ready , she was so ready . Then she said , " Do n't worry , Julie , every year on October 10 when it was your birthday but you did n't realize it , I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day . " 
Which was comforting , but troubling . 
My mother had been celebrating my birthday with me , without me . 
What was so upsetting about this new piece of information was not that I was going to have to change the date of my slumber party with all of my girlfriends , what was most upsetting was that this meant that I was not a Virgo . 
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom , and I read my horoscope every single day , and it was so totally me . 
And this meant that I was a Libra ? 
So , I took the bus downtown to get the new Libra poster . 
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair , sort of lounging by some water , but the Libra poster is just a huge scale . 
This was around the time that I started filling out physically , and I was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls , and , frankly , the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing . 
But I got the new Libra poster , and I started to read my new Libra horoscope , and I was astonished to find that it was also totally me . 
It was n't until years later , looking back on this whole age - of - reason / change - of - birthday thing , that it dawned on me : I was n't turning seven when I thought I turned seven . I had a whole other month to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me . 
Oh , life can be so cruel . 
One day , two Mormon missionaries came to my door . 
Now , I just live off a main thoroughfare in Los Angeles , and my block is -- well , it 's a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door . 
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven . 
And sometimes I get teenagers who promise me that they wo n't join a gang and just start robbing people if I only buy some magazine subscriptions from them . 
So , normally I just ignore the doorbell , but on this day I answered . 
And there stood two boys , each about 19 , in white starched short - sleeved shirts , and they had little name tags that identified them as official representatives of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , and they said they had a message for me from God . 
I said , " A message for me ? From God ? " And they said , " Yes . " 
Now , I was raised in the Pacific Northwest , around a lot of Church of Latter - day Saints people and , you know , I 've worked with them and even dated them , but I never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission , and I guess I was , sort of , curious , so I said , " Well , please , come in . " And they looked really happy , because I do n't think this happens to them all that often . 
And I sat them down , and I got them glasses of water -- OK , I got it . I got them glasses of water . 
Do n't touch my hair , that 's the thing . 
You ca n't put a video of myself in front of me and expect me not to fix my hair . 
OK . So I sat them down and I got them glasses of water , and after niceties they said , " Do you believe that God loves you with all his heart ? " 
And I thought , " Well , of course I believe in God , but , you know , I do n't like that word , heart , because it anthropomorphizes God , and I do n't like the word , ' his , ' either , because that sexualizes God . " 
But I did n't want to argue semantics with these boys , so after a very long , uncomfortable pause , I said " Yes , yes , I do . I feel very loved . " 
And they looked at each other and smiled , like that was the right answer . And then they said , " Do you believe that we 're all brothers and sisters on this planet ? " 
And I said , " Yes , I do . Yes , I do . " And I was so relieved that it was a question I could answer so quickly . 
And they said , " Well , then we have a story to tell you . " 
And they told me this story all about this guy named Lehi , who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC . 
Now , apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC , everyone was completely bad and evil . Every single one of them : man , woman , child , infant , fetus . 
And God came to Lehi and said to him , " Put your family on a boat and I will lead you out of here . " And God did lead them . 
He led them to America . 
I said , " America ? From Jerusalem to America by boat in 600 BC ? " 
And they said , " Yes . " 
Then they told me how Lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced , and over the course of 600 years there were two great races of them , the Nephites and the Lamanites , and the Nephites were totally , totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the Lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone . 
Then , after Jesus died on the cross for our sins , on his way up to heaven he stopped by America and visited the Nephites . 
And he told them that if they all remained totally , totally good -- each and every one of them -- they would win the war against the evil Lamanites . 
But apparently somebody blew it , because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites . 
All but one guy , this guy named Mormon , who managed to survive by hiding in the woods . 
And he made sure this whole story was written down in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics chiseled onto gold plates , which he then buried near Palmyra , New York . 
Well , I was just on the edge of my seat . 
I said , " What happened to the Lamanites ? " 
And they said , " Well , they became our Native Americans here in the U.S. " 
And I said , " So , you believe the Native Americans are descended from a people who were totally evil ? " And they said , " Yes . " 
Then they told me how this guy named Joseph Smith found those buried gold plates right in his backyard , and he also found this magic stone back there that he put into his hat and then buried his face into , and this allowed him to translate the gold plates from the reformed Egyptian into English . 
Well , at this point I just wanted to give these two boys some advice about their pitch . 
I wanted to say , " OK , do n't start with this story . " 
I mean , even the Scientologists know to start with a personality test before they start -- -- telling people all about Xenu , the evil intergalactic overlord . 
Well , then they said , " Do you believe that God speaks to us through his righteous prophets ? " And I said , " No , I do n't . " 
Because I was , sort of , upset about this Lamanite story and this crazy gold plate story , but the truth was , I had n't really thought this through , so I backpedaled a little and I said , " Well , what exactly do you mean by righteous ? 
And what do you mean by prophets ? Like , could the prophets be women ? " 
And they said , " No . " And I said , " Why ? " And they said , " Well , it 's because God gave women a gift that is so spectacular , it is so wonderful , that the only gift he had left over to give men was the gift of prophecy . " 
What is this wonderful gift God gave women , I wondered ? 
Maybe their greater ability to cooperate and adapt ? 
Women 's longer lifespan ? The fact that women tend to be much less violent than men ? But , no , it was n't any of these gifts . 
They said , " Well , it 's her ability to bear children . " 
I said , " Oh , come on . I mean , even if women tried to have a baby every single year from the time they were 15 to the time they were 45 , assuming they did n't die from exhaustion , it still seems like some women would have some time left over to hear the word of God . " And they said , " No . " 
Well , then they did n't look so fresh - faced and cute to me any more , but they had more to say . 
They said , " Well , we also believe that if you 're a Mormon and if you 're in good standing with the church , when you die you get to go to heaven and be with your family for all eternity . " 
And I said , " Oh , dear -- -- that would n't be such a good incentive for me . " 
And they said , " Oh -- hey , well , we also believe that when you go to heaven you get your body restored to you in its best original state . 
Like , if you 'd lost a leg , well , you get it back . 
Or , if you 'd gone blind , you could see . " 
I said , " Oh -- now , I do n't have a uterus because I had cancer a few years ago . So , does this mean that if I went to heaven I would get my old uterus back ? " And they said , " Sure . " 
And I said , " I do n't want it back . I 'm happy without it . " Gosh . 
What if you had a nose job and you liked it ? 
Would God force you to get your old nose back ? 
Well , then they gave me this Book of Mormon , and they told me to read this chapter and that chapter , and they said they 'd come back some day and check in on me , and I think I said something like , " Please do n't hurry , " or maybe it was just , " Please do n't , " and they were gone . 
OK , so , I initially felt really superior to these boys , and smug in my more conventional faith . But then , the more I thought about it , the more I had to be honest with myself . 
If someone came to my door and I was hearing Catholic theology and dogma for the very first time , and they said , " We believe that God impregnated a very young girl without the use of intercourse , and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us -- -- and she had a baby , and that 's the son of God , " I mean , I would think that 's equally ridiculous . 
I 'm just so used to that story . 
So , I could n't let myself feel condescending towards these boys . 
But the question they asked me when they first arrived really stuck in my head : Did I believe that God loved me with all his heart ? 
Because I was n't exactly sure how I felt about that question . 
Now , if they 'd asked me , Do you feel that God loves you with all his heart ? 
Well , that would have been much different , I think I would have instantly answered , " Yes , yes , I feel it all the time . I feel God 's love when I 'm hurt and confused , and I feel consoled and cared for . I take shelter in God 's love when I do n't understand why tragedy hits , and I feel God 's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see . " 
But since they asked me that question with the word believe in it , somehow it was all different , because I was n't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt .

Statistician Nic Marks asks why we measure a nation 's success by its productivity -- instead of by the happiness and well - being of its people . He introduces the Happy Planet Index , which tracks national well - being against resource use . Which countries rank highest in the HPI ? You might be surprised .

Nic Marks : The Happy Planet Index 
Martin Luther King did not say , " I have a nightmare , " when he inspired the civil rights movements . 
He said , " I have a dream . " 
And I have a dream . 
I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times , nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic . 
I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , " The Road . " 
It 's a beautiful piece of filmmaking , but everything is desolate , everything is dead . 
And just a father and son trying to survive , walking along the road . 
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future . 
For too long , we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what 's going to happen . 
We have focused on the worst - case scenario . 
We have focused on the problems . 
And we have not thought enough about the solutions . 
We 've used fear , if you like , to grab people 's attention . 
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism . 
It 's part of the fight and flight mechanism , that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer . 
A deer freezes very , very still , poised to run away . 
And I think that 's what we 're doing when we 're asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change . 
People are freezing and running away because we 're using fear . 
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is . 
What would it be like to be improving the human lot ? 
And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is , an economic definition of what progress is -- that somehow , if we get the right numbers to go up , we 're going to be better off , whether that 's on the stock market , whether that 's with GDP and economic growth , that somehow life is going to get better . 
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better . 
Come on . In the Western world , we have enough . 
Maybe some parts of the world do n't , but we have enough . 
And we 've know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations . 
In fact , the architect of our national accounting system , Simon Kuznets , in the 1930s , said that , " A nation 's welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income . " 
But we 've created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff . 
And indeed , this is probably historical , and it had its time . 
In the second World War , we needed to produce a lot of stuff . 
And indeed , we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe , and we had to rebuild it afterwards . 
And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce . 
But as early as 1968 , this visionary man , Robert Kennedy , at the start of his ill - fated presidential campaign , gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been . 
And he finished his talk with the phrase , that , " The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile . " 
How crazy is that ? That our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ? 
I believe , if Kennedy was alive today , he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile . 
He 'd be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustainability and people 's well - being . 
And actually , social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world . 
This is from a global survey . 
It 's asking people , what do they want . 
And unsurprisingly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their families , their children , their communities . 
Okay , they think money is slightly important . 
It 's there , but it 's not nearly as important as happiness , and it 's not nearly as important as love . 
We all need to love and be loved in life . 
It 's not nearly as important as health . 
We want to be healthy and live a full life . 
These seem to be natural human aspirations . 
Why are statisticians not measuring these ? 
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ? 
And really , this is what I 've done with my adult life -- is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well - being , how can we do that within environmental limits . 
And we created , at the organization that I work for , the New Economics Foundation , something we call the Happy Planet Index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy . 
Why do n't we create a measure of progress that shows that ? 
And what we do , is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens . 
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet . 
But we have to remember that there 's a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet 's resources we use . 
We all have one planet . We all have to share it . 
It is the ultimate scarce resource , the one planet that we share . 
And economics is very interested in scarcity . 
When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency . 
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck . 
And this is a measure of how much well - being we get for our planetary resource use . 
It is an efficiency measure . 
And probably the easiest way to show you that , is to show you this graph . 
Running horizontally along the graph , is " ecological footprint , " which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet . 
More is bad . 
Running vertically upwards , is a measure called " happy life years . " 
It 's about the well - being of nations . 
It 's like a happiness adjusted life - expectancy . 
It 's like quality and quantity of life in nations . 
And the yellow dot there you see , is the global average . 
Now , there 's a huge array of nations around that global average . 
To the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well - being , but they 're using a lot of planet to get there . 
They are the U.S.A. , other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually . 
Conversely , at the bottom left of the graph , are countries that are not producing much well - being -- typically , sub - Saharan Africa . 
In Hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there . 
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years . 
Malaria , HIV / AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world . 
But now for the good news ! 
There are some countries up there , yellow triangles , that are doing better than global average , that are heading up towards the top left of the graph . 
This is an aspirational graph . 
We want to be top left , where good lives do n't cost the earth . 
They 're Latin American . 
The country on its own up at the top is a place I have n't been to . 
Maybe some of you have . 
Costa Rica . 
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and - a - half years . 
That is longer than in the USA . 
They are , according to the latest Gallup world poll , the happiest nation on the planet -- than anybody ; more than Switzerland and Denmark . 
They are the happiest place . 
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in [ the ] Western world -- a quarter of the resources . 
What 's going on there ? 
What 's happening in Costa Rica ? 
We can look at some of the data . 
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources . 
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021 . 
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949 . 
And they invested in social programs -- health and education . 
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world . 
And they have that Latin vibe , do n't they . 
They have the social connectedness . 
The challenge is , that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American , might not be Western European . 
It might be Latin American . 
And the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here . 
That 's what we need to do . 
And if we 're going to do that , we need to pull countries from the bottom , and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph . 
And then we 're starting to create a happy planet . 
That 's one way of looking at it . 
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends . 
We do n't have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the richest countries , the OECD group , we do . 
And this is the trend in well - being over that time , a small increase , but this is the trend in ecological footprint . 
And so in strict happy - planet methodology , we 've become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to . 
And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening . 
It 's actually not very long away . 
It 's half a human lifetime away . 
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 . 
This is not the very distant future . 
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like . 
And I put it to you , that is not business as usual . 
That is changing our business . 
That is changing the way we create our organizations , we do our government policy and we live our lives . 
And the point is , we need to carry on increasing well - being . 
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce . 
None of us , I think , want human progress to stop . 
I think we want it to carry on . 
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing . 
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in . 
I think this is what they want . They want quality of life to keep increasing . 
They want to hold on to what they 've got . 
And if we 're going to engage them , I think that 's what we 've got to do . 
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more . 
Now that 's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those curves . 
And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time . 
Human beings are very motivated by the " now . " 
You put a smart meter in your home , and you see how much electricity you 're using right now , how much it 's costing you , your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly . 
What would that look like for society ? 
Why is it , on the radio news every evening , I hear the FTSE 100 , the Dow Jones , the dollar pound ratio -- I do n't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news . 
And why do I hear that ? 
Why do n't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday , or American used yesterday ? 
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions ? 
That 's how you create a collective goal . 
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it . 
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well - being At a government level , they might create national accounts of well - being . 
At a business level , you might look at the well - being of your employees , which we know is really linked to creativity , which is linked to innovation , and we 're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues . 
At a personal level , we need these nudges too . 
Maybe we do n't quite need the data , but we need reminders . 
In the U.K. , we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing . 
What are these for happiness ? 
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier ? 
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago , a big program called the Foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome . 
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive actions can you do to improve well - being in your life ? 
And the point of these is they are , not quite , the secrets of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from . 
And the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life . 
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ? 
Keep building them . 
The second one is be active . 
The fastest way out of a bad mood : step outside , go for a walk , turn the radio on and dance . 
Being active is great for our positive mood . 
The third one is take notice . 
How aware are you of things going on around the world , the seasons changing , people around you ? 
Do you notice what 's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge ? 
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness , cognitive behavioral therapy , [ very ] strong for our well being . 
The fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course . 
Older people who keep learning and are curious , they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down . 
But it does n't have to be formal learning ; it 's not knowledge based . 
It 's more curiosity . 
It can be learning to cook a new dish , picking up an instrument you forgot as a child . 
Keep learning . 
And the final one is that most anti - economic of activities , but give . 
Our generosity , our altruism , our compassion , are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain . 
We feel good if we give . 
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning . 
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people . 
You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves . 
And these five ways , which we put onto these handy postcards , I would say , do n't have to cost the earth . 
They do n't have any carbon content . 
They do n't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied . 
And so I think it 's really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth . 
Now , Martin Luther King , on the eve of his death , gave an incredible speech . 
He said , " I know there are challenges ahead , there may be trouble ahead , but I fear no one . I do n't care . 
I have been to the mountain top , and I have seen the Promised Land . " 
Now , he was a preacher , but I believe the environmental movement and , in fact , the business community , government , needs to go to the top of the mountain top , and it needs to look out , and it needs to see the Promised Land , or the land of promise , and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want . 
And not only that , we need to create a Great Transition to get there , and we need to pave that great transition with good things . 
Human beings want to be happy . 
Pave them with the five ways . 
And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the Happy Planet Index . 
And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the earth . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/ananda_shankar_jayant_fights_cancer_with_a_dance.html 
Renowned classical Indian dancer Ananda Shankar Jayant was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 . She tells her personal story of not only facing the disease but dancing through it , and gives a performance revealing the metaphor of strength that helped her do it .

Ananda Shankar Jayant fights cancer with dance 
[ Sanskrit ] This is an ode to the mother goddess , that most of us in India learn when we are children . 
I learned it when I was four at my mother 's knee . 
That year she introduced me to dance , and thus began my tryst with classical dance . 
Since then -- it 's been four decades now -- I 've trained with the best in the field , performed across the globe , taught young and old alike , created , collaborated , choreographed , and wove a rich tapestry of artistry , achievement and awards . 
The crowning glory was in 2007 , when I received this country 's fourth highest civilian award , the Padma Shri , for my contribution to art . 
But nothing , nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008 . 
I heard the word " carcinoma . " 
Yes , breast cancer . 
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor 's office , I heard other words : " cancer , " " stage , " " grade . " 
Until then , Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend , stage was what I performed on , and grades were what I got in school . 
That day , I realized I had an unwelcome , uninvited , new life partner . 
As a dancer , I know the nine rasas or the navarasas : anger , valor , disgust , humor and fear . 
I thought I knew what fear was . 
That day , I learned what fear was . 
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control , I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband , Jayant . 
I said , " Is this it ? Is this the end of the road ? 
Is this the end of my dance ? " 
And he , the positive soul that he is , said , " No , this is just a hiatus , a hiatus during the treatment , and you 'll get back to doing what you do best . " 
I realized then that I , who thought I had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : My thought , my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it . 
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enormity of the situation , wanting to go to a place of healing , health and happiness . 
I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be , for which I needed something . 
I needed something that would pull me out of all this . 
So I dried my tears , and I declared to the world at large ... 
I said , " Cancer 's only one page in my life , and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life . " 
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out , and I would not allow cancer to ride me . 
But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be , I needed something . 
I needed an anchor , an image , a peg to peg this process on , so that I could go from there . 
And I found that in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my very life breath . 
But it was n't easy . 
Believe me , it definitely was n't easy . 
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ? 
How do you not despair when , with the body ravaged by chemotherapy , climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture , that to someone like me who could dance for three hours ? 
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all ? 
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep . 
But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have . 
So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body , mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio , and learn everything I learned when I was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped . 
It was excruciatingly painful , but I did it . 
Difficult . 
I focused on my mudras , on the imagery of my dance , on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself . 
And slowly , I moved out of that miserable state of mind . 
But I needed something else . 
I needed something to go that extra mile , and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four . 
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini , of Durga . 
Durga , the mother goddess , the fearless one , created by the pantheon of Hindu gods . 
Durga , resplendent , bedecked , beautiful , her 18 arms ready for warfare , as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur . 
Durga , the epitome of creative feminine energy , or shakti . 
Durga , the fearless one . 
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute , her every nuance , my very own . 
Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training , I brought laser - sharp focus into my dance , laser - sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery . 
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles , much to the dismay of my oncologist . 
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule . 
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance . 
Yes , cancer has just been one page in my life . 
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks , obstacles and challenges that life throws at you . 
My story is the power of thought . 
My story is the power of choice . 
It 's the power of focus . 
It 's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you , so moves you , that something even like cancer becomes insignificant . 
My story is the power of a metaphor . 
It 's the power of an image . 
Mine was that of Durga , Durga the fearless one . 
She was also called Simhanandini , the one who rode the lion . 
As I ride out , as I ride my own inner strength , my own inner resilience , armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment , as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer , asking my rogue cells to behave , I want to be known not as a cancer survivor , but as a cancer conqueror . 
I present to you an excerpt of that work " Simhanandini . " 
http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html 
20 years ago , Tim Berners - Lee invented the World Wide Web . For his next project , he 's building a web for open , linked data that could do for numbers what the Web did for words , pictures , video : unlock our data and reframe the way we use it together .

Tim Berners - Lee on the next Web 
Time flies . 
It 's actually almost 20 years ago when I wanted to reframe the way we use information , the way we work together : I invented the World Wide Web . 
Now , 20 years on , at TED , I want to ask your help in a new reframing . 
So going back to 1989 , I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system . 
Nobody really did anything with it , pretty much . 
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens -- 18 months later , my boss said I could do it on the side , as a sort of a play project , kick the tires of a new computer we 'd got . 
And so he gave me the time to code it up . 
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like : hypertext protocol , HTTP ; the idea of URLs , these names for things which started with HTTP . 
I wrote the code and put it out there . 
Why did I do it ? 
Well , it was basically frustration . 
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer in this huge , very exciting lab , lots of people coming from all over the world . 
They brought all sorts of different computers with them . 
They had all sorts of different data formats , all sorts , all kinds of documentation systems . 
So that , in all that diversity , if I wanted to figure out how to build something out of a bit of this and a bit of this , everything I looked into , I had to connect to some new machine , I had to learn to run some new program , I would find the information I wanted in some new data format . 
And these were all incompatible . 
It was just very frustrating . 
The frustration was all this unlocked potential . 
In fact , on all these discs there were documents . 
So if you just imagined them all being part of some big , virtual documentation system in the sky , say on the Internet , then life would be so much easier . 
Well , once you 've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin and even if people do n't read your memo -- actually he did , it was found after he died , his copy . 
He had written , " Vague , but exciting , " in pencil , in the corner . 
But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like . 
It 's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then . 
But then -- OK , when TED started , there was no web so things like " click " did n't have the same meaning . 
I can show somebody a piece of hypertext , a page which has got links , and we click on the link and bing -- there 'll be another hypertext page . 
Not impressive . 
You know , we 've seen that -- we 've got things on hypertext on CD - ROMs . 
What was difficult was to get them to imagine : so , imagine that that link could have gone to virtually any document you could imagine . 
Alright , that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make . 
Well , some people did . 
So yeah , it was difficult to explain , but there was a grassroots movement . 
And that is what has made it most fun . 
That has been the most exciting thing , not the technology , not the things people have done with it , but actually the community , the spirit of all these people getting together , sending the emails . 
That 's what it was like then . 
Do you know what ? It 's funny , but right now it 's kind of like that again . 
I asked everybody , more or less , to put their documents -- I said , " Could you put your documents on this web thing ? " 
And you did . 
Thanks . 
It 's been a blast , has n't it ? 
I mean , it has been quite interesting because we 've found out that the things that happen with the web really sort of blow us away . 
They 're much more than we 'd originally imagined when we put together the little , initial website that we started off with . 
Now , I want you to put your data on the web . 
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential . 
There is still a huge frustration that people have because we have n't got data on the web as data . 
What do you mean , " data " ? What 's the difference -- documents , data ? 
Well , documents you read , OK ? 
More or less , you read them , you can follow links from them , and that 's it . 
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer . 
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling 's talk ? 
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it -- one of the great TED Talks . 
Hans put up this presentation in which he showed , for various different countries , in various different colors -- he showed income levels on one axis and he showed infant mortality , and he shot this thing animated through time . 
So , he 'd taken this data and made a presentation which just shattered a lot of myths that people had about the economics in the developing world . 
He put up a slide a little bit like this . 
It had underground all the data OK , data is brown and boxy and boring , and that 's how we think of it , is n't it ? 
Because data you ca n't naturally use by itself But in fact , data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it . 
In this case , Hans had put the data together he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things . 
He had put it together , combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he 'd put it into this software , which I think his son developed , originally , and produces this wonderful presentation . 
And Hans made a point of saying , " Look , it 's really important to have a lot of data . " 
And I was happy to see that at the party last night that he was still saying , very forcibly , " It 's really important to have a lot of data . " 
So I want us now to think about not just two pieces of data being connected , or six like he did , but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web and then calling that linked data . 
The technology is linked data , and it 's extremely simple . 
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules : first thing is that those HTTP names -- those things that start with " http : " -- we 're using them not just for documents now , we 're using them for things that the documents are about . 
We 're using them for people , we 're using them for places , we 're using them for your products , we 're using them for events . 
All kinds of conceptual things , they have names now that start with HTTP . 
Second rule , if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data using the HTTP protocol from the web , I will get back some data in a standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know about that thing , about that event . 
Who 's at the event ? Whatever it is about that person , where they were born , things like that . 
So the second rule is I get important information back . 
Third rule is that when I get back that information it 's not just got somebody 's height and weight and when they were born , it 's got relationships . 
Data is relationships . 
Interestingly , data is relationships . 
This person was born in Berlin ; Berlin is in Germany . 
And when it has relationships , whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that it 's related to is given one of those names that starts HTTP . 
So , I can go ahead and look that thing up . 
So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born ; then I can look up the region it 's in , and the town it 's in , and the population of it , and so on . 
So I can browse this stuff . 
So that 's it , really . 
That is linked data . 
I wrote an article entitled " Linked Data " a couple of years ago and soon after that , things started to happen . 
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots of these boxes that Hans had , and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting . 
It 's not just a whole lot of other plants . 
It 's not just a root supplying a plant , but for each of those plants , whatever it is -- a presentation , an analysis , somebody 's looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together , and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together , the more powerful it is . 
So , linked data . 
The meme went out there . 
And , pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin who was one of the first people to put interesting things up , he noticed that Wikipedia -- you know Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia with lots and lots of interesting documents in it . 
Well , in those documents , there are little squares , little boxes . 
And in most information boxes , there 's data . 
So he wrote a program to take the data , extract it from Wikipedia , and put it into a blob of linked data on the web , which he called dbpedia . 
Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide and if you actually go and look up Berlin , you 'll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about Berlin , and they 're linked together . 
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin , you 'll end up pulling up these other things as well . 
And the exciting thing is it 's starting to grow . 
This is just the grassroots stuff again , OK ? 
Let 's think about data for a bit . 
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms Think of the diversity of the web . It 's a really important thing that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there . 
So it is with data . I could talk about all kinds of data . 
We could talk about government data , enterprise data is really important , there 's scientific data , there 's personal data , there 's weather data , there 's data about events , there 's data about talks , and there 's news and there 's all kinds of stuff . 
I 'm just going to mention a few of them so that you get the idea of the diversity of it , so that you also see how much unlocked potential . 
Let 's start with government data . 
Barack Obama said in a speech , that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet in accessible formats . 
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data . 
That 's important . Why is it important ? 
Not just for transparency , yeah transparency in government is important , but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America . 
It 's actual useful . It 's got value . 
I can use it in my company . 
I could use it as a kid to do my homework . 
So we 're talking about making the place , making the world run better by making this data available . 
In fact if you 're responsible -- if you know about some data in a government department , often you find that these people , they 're very tempted to keep it -- Hans calls it database hugging . 
You hug your database , you do n't want to let it go until you 've made a beautiful website for it . 
Well , I 'd like to suggest that rather -- yes , make a beautiful website , who am I to say do n't make a beautiful website ? 
Make a beautiful website , but first give us the unadulterated data , we want the data . 
We want unadulterated data . 
OK , we have to ask for raw data now . 
And I 'm going to ask you to practice that , OK ? 
Can you say " raw " ? 
Audience : Raw . 
Tim Berners - Lee : Can you say " data " ? 
Audience : Data . 
TBL : Can you say " now " ? 
Audience : Now ! 
TBL : Alright , " raw data now " ! 
Audience : Raw data now ! 
Practice that . It 's important because you have no idea the number of excuses people come up with to hang onto their data and not give it to you , even though you 've paid for it as a taxpayer . 
And it 's not just America . It 's all over the world . 
And it 's not just governments , of course -- it 's enterprises as well . 
So I 'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data . 
Here we are at TED , and all the time we are very conscious of the huge challenges that human society has right now -- curing cancer , understanding the brain for Alzheimer 's , understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable , understanding how the world works . 
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists -- they have half - formed ideas in their head , they try to communicate those over the web . 
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on databases , often sitting in their computers , and actually , currently not shared . 
In fact , I 'll just go into one area -- if you 're looking at Alzheimer 's , for example , drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out because scientists in that field realize this is a great way of getting out of those silos , because they had their genomics data in one database in one building , and they had their protein data in another . 
Now , they are sticking it onto -- linked data -- and now they can ask the sort of question , that you probably would n't ask , I would n't ask -- they would . 
What proteins are involved in signal transduction and also related to pyramidal neurons ? 
Well , you take that mouthful and you put it into Google . 
Of course , there 's no page on the web which has answered that question because nobody has asked that question before . 
You get 223,000 hits -- no results you can use . 
You ask the linked data -- which they 've now put together -- 32 hits , each of which is a protein which has those properties and you can look at . 
The power of being able to ask those questions , as a scientist -- questions which actually bridge across different disciplines -- is really a complete sea change . 
It 's very very important . 
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment -- the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems . 
Now if I go on like this , you 'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you . 
But , that 's not true . 
In fact , data is about our lives . 
You just -- you log on to your social networking site , your favorite one , you say , " This is my friend . " 
Bing ! Relationship . Data . 
You say , " This photograph , it 's about -- it depicts this person . " Bing ! That 's data . Data , data , data . 
Every time you do things on the social networking site , the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re - purposing it -- and using it to make other people 's lives more interesting on the site . 
But , when you go to another linked data site -- and let 's say this is one about travel , and you say , " I want to send this photo to all the people in that group , " you ca n't get over the walls . 
The Economist wrote an article about it , and lots of people have blogged about it -- tremendous frustration . 
The way to break down the silos is to get inter - operability between social networking sites . 
We need to do that with linked data . 
One last type of data I 'll talk about , maybe it 's the most exciting . 
Before I came down here , I looked it up on OpenStreetMap The OpenStreetMap 's a map , but it 's also a Wiki . 
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we 're in right now -- The Terrace Theater . It did n't have a name on it . 
So I could go into edit mode , I could select the theater , I could add down at the bottom the name , and I could save it back . 
And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap . org , and you find this place , you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name . 
I did that . Me ! 
I did that to the map . I just did that ! 
I put that up on there . Hey , you know what ? 
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit and it creates an incredible resource because everybody else does theirs . 
And that is what linked data is all about . 
It 's about people doing their bit to produce a little bit , and it all connecting . 
That 's how linked data works . 
You do your bit . Everybody else does theirs . 
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it . 
And we 've practiced that . 
So , linked data -- it 's huge . 
I 've only told you a very small number of things There are data in every aspect of our lives , every aspect of work and pleasure , and it 's not just about the number of places where data comes , it 's about connecting it together . 
And when you connect data together , you get power in a way that does n't happen just with the web , with documents . 
You get this really huge power out of it . 
So , we 're at the stage now where we have to do this -- the people who think it 's a great idea . 
And all the people -- and I think there 's a lot of people at TED who do things because -- even though there 's not an immediate return on the investment because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it -- they 'll do it because they 're the sort of person who just does things which would be good if everybody else did them . 
OK , so it 's called linked data . 
I want you to make it . 
I want you to demand it . 
And I think it 's an idea worth spreading . 
Thanks .

Daniel Goleman on compassion 
You know , I 'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED is compassion , these very moving demonstrations we 've just seen : HIV in Africa , President Clinton last night . 
And I 'd like to do a little collateral thinking , if you will , about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal . 
I 'm a psychologist , but rest assured , I will not bring it to the scrotal . 
There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help , we do sometimes , and we do n't other times . 
A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic . 
Half of those students were given , as a topic , the parable of the Good Samaritan : the man who stopped the stranger in -- to help the stranger in need by the side of the road . 
Half were given random Bible topics . 
Then one by one , they were told they had to go to another building and give their sermon . 
As they went from the first building to the second , each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning , clearly in need . The question is : Did they stop to help ? 
The more interesting question is : Did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the Good Samaritan ? Answer : No , not at all . 
What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late , or were they absorbed in what they were going to talk about . 
And this is , I think , the predicament of our lives : that we do n't take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction . 
There 's a new field in brain science , social neuroscience . 
This studies the circuitry in two people 's brains that activates while they interact . 
And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help . 
That is to say , if we attend to the other person , we automatically empathize , we automatically feel with them . 
There are these newly identified neurons , mirror neurons , that act like a neuro Wi - Fi , activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs . We feel " with " automatically . 
And if that person is in need , if that person is suffering , we 're automatically prepared to help . At least that 's the argument . 
But then the question is : Why do n't we ? 
And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self - absorption , to noticing , to empathy and to compassion . 
And the simple fact is , if we are focused on ourselves , if we 're preoccupied , as we so often are throughout the day , we do n't really fully notice the other . 
And this difference between the self and the other focus can be very subtle . 
I was doing my taxes the other day , and I got to the point where I was listing all of the donations I gave , and I had an epiphany , it was -- I came to my check to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought , boy , my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy that I gave money to Seva . 
Then I realized that what I was getting from giving was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself . 
Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas whose cataracts would be helped , and I realized that I went from this kind of narcissistic self - focus to altruistic joy , to feeling good for the people that were being helped . I think that 's a motivator . 
But this distinction between focusing on ourselves and focusing on others is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to . 
You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating . 
I was at a sushi restaurant a while back and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman , who was in the singles scene . And this woman says , " My brother is having trouble getting dates , so he 's trying speed dating . " I do n't know if you know speed dating ? 
Women sit at tables and men go from table to table , and there 's a clock and a bell , and at five minutes , bingo , the conversation ends and the woman can decide whether to give her card or her email address to the man for follow up . And this woman says , " My brother 's never gotten a card , and I know exactly why . 
The moment he sits down , he starts talking non - stop about himself ; he never asks about the woman . " 
And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section of The New York Times , looking at the back stories of marriages -- because they 're very interesting -- and I came to the marriage of Alice Charney Epstein . And she said that when she was in the dating scene , she had a simple test she put people to . 
The test was : from the moment they got together , how long it would take the guy to ask her a question with the word " you " in it . 
And apparently Epstein aced the test , therefore the article . 
Now this is a -- it 's a little test I encourage you to try out at a party . 
Here at TED there are great opportunities . 
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called " The Human Moment , " about how to make real contact with a person at work . And they said , well , the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry , close your laptop , end your daydream and pay full attention to the person . 
There is a newly coined word in the English language for the moment when the person we 're with whips out their BlackBerry or answers that cell phone , and all of a sudden we do n't exist . 
The word is " pizzled " : it 's a combination of puzzled and pissed off . 
I think it 's quite apt . It 's our empathy , it 's our tuning in which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths . 
I have a brother - in - law who 's an expert on horror and terror -- he wrote the Annotated Dracula , the Essential Frankenstein -- he was trained as a Chaucer scholar , but he was born in Transylvania and I think it affected him a little bit . 
At any rate , at one point my brother - in - law , Leonard , decided to write a book about a serial killer . 
This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we 're in many years ago . He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler . 
And before he was arrested , he had murdered his grandparents , his mother and five co - eds at UC Santa Cruz . 
So my brother - in - law goes to interview this killer and he realizes when he meets him that this guy is absolutely terrifying . 
For one thing , he 's almost seven feet tall . 
But that 's not the most terrifying thing about him . 
The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160 : a certified genius . 
But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy , feeling with the other person . 
They 're controlled by different parts of the brain . 
So at one point , my brother - in - law gets up the courage to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to , and that is : how could you have done it ? 
Did n't you feel any pity for your victims ? 
These were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims . 
And the strangler says very matter - of - factly , " Oh no . If I 'd felt the distress , I could not have done it . 
I had to turn that part of me off . I had to turn that part of me off . " 
And I think that that is very troubling , and in a sense , I 've been reflecting on turning that part of us off . 
When we focus on ourselves in any activity , we do turn that part of ourselves off if there 's another person . 
Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities of a compassionate consumerism . 
Right now , as Bill McDonough has pointed out , the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences . 
We 're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot . 
We do n't notice and do n't notice that we do n't notice the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats . 
Or we do n't know if that fabric is a technological or manufacturing nutrient ; it can be reused or does it just end up at landfill ? In other words , we 're oblivious to the ecological and public health and social and economic justice consequences of the things we buy and use . 
In a sense , the room itself is the elephant in the room , but we do n't see it . And we 've become victims of a system that points us elsewhere . Consider this . 
There 's a wonderful book called Stuff : The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects . 
And it talks about the back story of something like a t - shirt . 
And it talks about where the cotton was grown and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences for soil of that fertilizer . And it mentions , for instance , that cotton is very resistant to textile dye ; about 60 percent washes off into wastewater . 
And it 's well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia . 
There 's a company , Bennett and Company , that supplies Polo.com , Victoria 's Secret -- they , because of their CEO , who 's aware of this , in China formed a joint venture with their dye works to make sure that the wastewater would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater . 
Right now , we do n't have the option to choose the virtuous t - shirt over the non - virtuous one . So what would it take to do that ? 
Well , I 've been thinking . For one thing , there 's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store . 
You can track it back to the factory . Once you can track it back to the factory , you can look at the manufacturing processes that were used to make it , and if it 's virtuous , you can label it that way . Or if it 's not so virtuous , you can go into -- today , go into any store , put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode , which will take you to a website . 
They have it for people with allergies to peanuts . 
That website could tell you things about that object . 
In other words , at point of purchase , we might be able to make a compassionate choice . 
There 's a saying in the world of information science : ultimately everybody will know everything . 
And the question is : will it make a difference ? 
Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times , it was in the ' 80s , I did an article on what was then a new problem in New York -- it was homeless people on the streets . 
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless . And I realized seeing the homeless through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients that had nowhere to go . They had a diagnosis . It made me -- what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where , when we see , when we 're passing someone who 's homeless in the periphery of our vision , it stays on the periphery . 
We do n't notice and therefore we do n't act . 
One day soon after that -- it was a Friday -- at the end of the day , I went down -- I was going down to the subway . It was rush hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs . 
And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side , shirtless , not moving , and people were just stepping over him -- hundreds and hundreds of people . 
And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened , I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong . 
The moment I stopped , half a dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy . 
And we found out that he was Hispanic , he did n't speak any English , he had no money , he 'd been wandering the streets for days , starving , and he 'd fainted from hunger . 
Immediately someone went to get orange juice , someone brought a hotdog , someone brought a subway cop . 
This guy was back on his feet immediately . 
But all it took was that simple act of noticing , and so I 'm optimistic . 
Thank you very much .

Richard Branson 's life at 30,000 feet 
Chris Anderson : Welcome to TED . 
Richard Branson : Thank you very much . The first TED has been great . 
CA : Have you met anyone interesting ? 
RB : Well , the nice thing about TED is everybody 's interesting . 
I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn , because I had an apology to make to her . 
I 'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I 'd -- she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I could n't get it off . 
And I went home to my wife that night and she wanted to know why I had another woman 's big , massive , big wedding ring on my finger . 
And , anyway , the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler and get it cut off . 
So -- -- so apologies to Goldie . 
CA : That 's pretty good . 
So , we 're going to put up some slides of some of your companies here . 
You 've started one or two in your time . 
So , you know , Virgin Atlantic , Virgin Records -- I guess it all started with a magazine called Student . 
And then , yes , all these other ones as well . I mean , how do you do this ? 
RB : I read all these sort of TED instructions : you must not talk about your own business , and this , and now you ask me . 
So I suppose you 're not going to be able to kick me off the stage , since you asked the question . 
CA : It depends what the answer is though . 
RB : No , I mean , I think I learned early on that if you can run one company , you can really run any companies . 
I mean , companies are all about finding the right people , inspiring those people , you know , drawing out the best in people . 
And I just love learning and I 'm incredibly inquisitive and I love taking on , you know , the status quo and trying to turn it upside down . 
So I 've seen life as one long learning process . 
And if I see -- you know , if I fly on somebody else 's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one , which it was n't , 21 years ago , then I 'd think , well , you know , maybe I can create the kind of airline that I 'd like to fly on . 
And so , you know , so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go . 
CA : Well , that was a bizarre thing , because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy . 
And in fact , in a way , it almost took down your empire at one point . 
I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who , at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic , and his view was that you were trading , you know , the world 's fourth biggest record company for the twenty - fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind . 
Why did you do that ? 
RB : Well , I think that there 's a very thin dividing line between success and failure . 
And I think if you start a business without financial backing , you 're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line . 
We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways . 
They were trying to put our airline out of business , and they launched what 's become known as the dirty tricks campaign . 
And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down unless I chipped in a chip . 
And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline , and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company , I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline . 
CA : Post - Napster , you 're looking like a bit of a genius , actually , for that as well . 
RB : Yeah , as it turned out , it proved to be the right move . 
But , yeah , it was sad at the time , but we moved on . 
CA : Now , you use the Virgin brand a lot and it seems like you 're getting synergy from one thing to the other . 
What does the brand stand for in your head ? 
RB : Well , I like to think it stands for quality , that you know , if somebody comes across a Virgin company , they -- CA : They are quality , Richard . Come on now , everyone says quality . Spirit ? 
RB : No , but I was going to move on this . 
We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it . 
As I say , we go in and shake up other industries , and I think , you know , we do it differently and I think that industries are not quite the same as a result of Virgin attacking the market . 
CA : I mean , there are a few launches you 've done where the brand maybe has n't worked quite as well . 
I mean , Virgin Brides -- what happened there ? 
RB : We could n't find any customers . 
CA : I was actually also curious why -- I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch . You called it Mates . 
I mean , could n't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well ? 
Ai n't virgin no longer , or something . 
RB : Again , we may have had problems finding customers . 
I mean , we had -- often , when you launch a company and you get customer complaints , you know , you can deal with them . 
But about three months after the launch of the condom company , I had a letter , a complaint , and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely . 
But obviously , there was n't a lot I could do about it . 
And then six months later , or nine months after the problem had taken , I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby asking if I 'd be godfather , which I became . 
So , it all worked out well . 
CA : Really ? You should have brought a picture . That 's wonderful . 
RB : I should have . 
CA : So , just help us with some of the numbers . 
I mean , what are the numbers on this ? 
I mean , how big is the group overall ? 
How much -- what 's the total revenue ? 
RB : It 's about 25 billion dollars now , in total . 
CA : And how many employees ? 
RB : About 55,000 . 
CA : So , you 've been photographed in various ways at various times and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that . 
What was that ? Was that real ? 
RB : Yeah . We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles , I think . 
No , I mean , I think -- CA : But is that your hair ? 
RB : No . 
CA : What was that one ? 
RB : Dropping in for tea . 
CA : OK . 
RB : Ah , that was quite fun . That was a wonderful car - boat in which -- CA : Oh , that car that we -- actually we -- it was a TEDster event there , I think . 
Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually , for a minute ? 
RB : It 's a tough job , is n't it ? 
CA : I mean , it is a tough job . 
When I first came to America , I used to try this with employees as well and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here , it 's very strange . 
RB : I know , I have -- the lawyers say you must n't do things like that , but -- CA : I mean , speaking of which , tell us about -- RB : " Pammy " we launched , you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on Coca - Cola , and we launched a cola bottle called " The Pammy " and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson . 
But the trouble is , it kept on tipping over , but -- CA : Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps ? 
RB : Of course . 
CA : So , we 'll just run a couple more pictures here . Virgin Brides . Very nice . 
And , OK , so stop there . This was -- you had some award I think ? 
RB : Yeah , well , 25 years earlier , we 'd launched the Sex Pistols ' " God Save The Queen , " and I 'd certainly never expected that 25 years later -- that she 'd actually knight us . 
But somehow , she must have had a forgetful memory , I think . 
CA : Well , God saved her and you got your just reward . 
Do you like to be called Sir Richard , or how ? 
RB : Nobody 's ever called me Sir Richard . 
Occasionally in America , I hear people saying Sir Richard and think there 's some Shakespearean play taking place . 
But nowhere else anyway . 
CA : OK . So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ... 
RB : No . I suppose if you 're having problems getting a booking in a restaurant or something , that might be worth using it . 
CA : You know , it 's not Richard Branson . It 's Sir Richard Branson . 
RB : I 'll go get the secretary to use it . 
CA : OK . So let 's look at the space thing . 
I think , with us , we 've got a video that shows what you 're up to , and Virgin Galactic up in the air . 
So that 's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship ? 
RB : Yeah , it 'll be ready in -- well , ready in 12 months and then we do 12 months extensive testing . 
And then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space . 
CA : So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed ? 
RB : Philippe has done the -- yeah , quite a bit of it : the logos and he 's building the space station in New Mexico . 
And basically , he 's just taken an eye and the space station will be one giant eye , so when you 're in space , you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you . 
And when you land , you 'll be able to go back into this giant eye . 
But he 's an absolute genius when it comes to design . 
CA : But you did n't have him design the engine ? 
RB : Philippe is quite erratic , so I think that he would n't be the best person to design the engine , no . 
CA : He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago . 
RB : Yeah ? No , he is a -- CA : Well , some people found it wonderful , some people found it completely bizarre . 
But , I personally found it wonderful . 
RB : He 's a wonderful enthusiast , which is why I love him . But ... 
CA : So , now , you 've always had this exploration bug in you . 
Have you ever regretted that ? 
RB : Many times . 
I mean , I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we 've done in the past . 
Well , I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters , so -- and each time , I did n't expect to come home to tell the tale . 
So in those moments , you certainly wonder what you 're doing up there or -- CA : What was the closest you got to -- when did you think , this is it , I might be on my way out ? 
RB : Well , I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was , each one , actually , I think we came close . 
And , I mean , first of all we -- nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before , so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream , and we were n't quite sure , when a balloon actually got into the jet stream , whether it would actually survive the 200 , 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there . 
And so , just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic , as we were pushing into the jet stream , this enormous balloon -- the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour , the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour , and it just took off . 
And it was like holding onto a thousand horses . 
And we were just crossing every finger , praying that the balloon would hold together , which , fortunately , it did . 
But the ends of all those balloon trips were , you know -- something seemed to go wrong every time , and on that particular occasion , the more experienced balloonist who was with me jumped , and left me holding on for dear life . 
CA : Did he tell you to jump , or he just said , " I 'm out of here ! " and ... 
RB : No , he told me jump , but once his weight had gone , the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ... 
CA : And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that . 
RB : Yeah . No , I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon , with my parachute , looking at the swirling clouds below , trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea , which -- and it was a very , very , very lonely few moments . 
But , anyway , we managed to survive it . 
CA : Did you jump ? Or it came down in the end ? 
RB : Well , I knew I had about half an hour 's fuel left , and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped , I would only have a couple of minutes of life left . 
So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried to make sure that I was making the right decision . 
And wrote some notes to my family . And then climbed back up again , looked down at those clouds again , climbed back into the capsule again . 
And then finally , just thought , there 's a better way . 
I 've got , you know , this enormous balloon above me , it 's the biggest parachute ever , why not use it ? 
And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds , and about 50 feet , before I hit the sea , threw myself over . 
And the balloon hit the sea and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me . 
But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and -- CA : What did you write to your family ? 
RB : Just what you would do in a situation like that : just I love you very much . And I 'd already written them a letter before going on this trip , which -- just in case anything had happened . 
But fortunately , they never had to use it . 
CA : Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics . 
The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls , you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere . 
And cynics might say , you know , this is just a smart business guy doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing . 
How much was the PR value part of this ? 
RB : Well , of course , the PR experts said that as an airline owner , the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats , and crashing into the seas . 
CA : They have a point , Richard . 
RB : In fact , I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying , you know , come on , Richard , there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic . 
CA : To do all this , you must have been a genius from the get - go , right ? 
RB : Well , I wo n't contradict that . 
CA : OK , this is n't exactly hardball . OK . 
Did n't -- were n't you just terrible at school ? 
RB : I was dyslexic . I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever . 
I certainly would have failed IQ tests . 
And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old . 
And if I -- if I 'm not interested in something , I do n't grasp it . 
As somebody who 's dyslexic , you also have some quite bizarre situations . 
I mean , for instance , I 've had to -- you know , I 've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe , but have n't been able to know the difference between net and gross . 
And so the board meetings have been fascinating . 
And so , it 's like , good news or bad news ? 
And generally , the people would say , oh , well that 's bad news . 
CA : But just to clarify , the 25 billion dollars is gross , right ? That 's gross ? 
RB : Well , I hope it 's net actually , having -- -- I 've got it right . 
CA : No , trust me , it 's gross . 
RB : So , when I turned 50 , somebody took me outside the boardroom and said , " Look Richard , here 's a -- let me draw on a diagram . 
Here 's a net in the sea , and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net . 
And that 's the profits you 've got left over in this little net , everything else is eaten . " 
And I finally worked it all out . 
CA : But , I mean , at school -- so as well as being , you know , doing pretty miserably academically , but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams . 
So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader , but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then , or how would you ... 
RB : Yeah , I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I ... And I was , yeah , I was fortunately good at sport , and so at least I had something to excel at , at school . 
CA : And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life . 
I mean , there 's the story about your mother allegedly dumping you in a field , aged four , and saying " OK , walk home . " 
Did this really happen ? 
RB : She was , you know , she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age . 
So she did things to us , which now she 'd be arrested for , such as pushing us out of the car , and telling us to find our own way to Granny 's , about five miles before we actually got there . 
And making us go on wonderful , long bike rides . 
And we were never allowed to watch television and the like . 
CA : But is there a risk here ? 
I mean , there 's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy , and they 've got kids , and we 've got this dilemma about how you bring them up . 
Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they 're too coddled , they do n't know what they 've got , we 're going to raise a generation of privileged ... 
RB : No , I think if you 're bringing up kids , you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm . 
So I do n't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really . 
CA : You did n't turn out too bad , I have to say , I 'm ... 
Your headmaster said to you -- I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school -- he said , you 're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison , and I 'm not sure which . 
Which of those happened first ? 
RB : Well , I 've done both . I think I went to prison first . 
I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K. 
I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act and the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act . 
On the first occasion , for mentioning the word venereal disease in public , which -- we had a center where we would help young people who had problems . 
And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease . 
And there 's an ancient law that says you ca n't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public . 
So the police knocked on the door , and told us they were going to arrest us if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease . 
We changed it to social diseases and people came along with acne and spots , but nobody came with VD any more . 
So , we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested . 
And then subsequently , " Never Mind the Bollocks , Here 's the Sex Pistols , " the word bollocks , the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols ' album . 
And John Mortimer , the playwright , defended us . 
And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks . 
And so I rang up Nottingham University , and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics . 
And he said , " Look , bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever . 
It 's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century . " 
And he went , " Furthermore , I 'm a priest myself . " 
And so I said , " Would you mind coming to the court ? " 
And he said he 'd be delighted . And I said -- and he said , " Would you like me to wear my dog collar ? " 
And I said , " Yes , definitely . Please . " 
CA : That 's great . 
RB : So our key witness argued that it was actually " Never Mind the Priest , Here 's the Sex Pistols . " 
And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty , so ... 
CA : That is outrageous . 
So seriously , is there a dark side ? 
A lot of people would say there 's no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back , you know , doing some ugly things . 
You 've been accused of being ruthless . 
There was a nasty biography written about you by someone . 
Is any of it true ? Is there an element of truth in it ? 
RB : I do n't actually think that the stereotype of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top , generally speaking , works . 
I think if you treat people well , people will come back and come back for more . 
And I think all you have in life is your reputation and it 's a very small world . 
And I actually think that the best way of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well , and I like to think that 's how we run Virgin . 
CA : And what about the people who love you and who see you spending -- you keep getting caught up in these new projects , but it almost feels like you 're addicted to launching new stuff . 
You get excited by an idea and , kapow ! 
I mean , do you think about life balance ? 
How do your family feel about each time you step into something big and new ? 
RB : I also believe that being a father 's incredibly important , so from the time the kids were very young , you know , when they go on holiday , I go on holiday with them . 
And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together . 
Yes , I 'll , you know , be in touch . We 're very lucky , we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can -- so I can take them there and we can bring friends , and we can play together , but I can also keep in touch with what 's going on . 
CA : You started talking in recent years about this term capitalist philanthropy . 
What is that ? 
RB : Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works . 
You know , the alternative , communism , has not worked . 
But the problem with capitalism is extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people , and therefore extreme responsibility , I think , goes with that wealth . 
And I think it 's important that the individuals , who are in that fortunate position , do not end up competing for bigger and bigger boats , and bigger and bigger cars , but , you know , use that money to either create new jobs or to tackle issues around the world . 
CA : And what are the issues that you worry about most , care most about , want to turn your resources toward ? 
RB : Well , there 's -- I mean there 's a lot of issues . 
I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind and we are putting a lot of time and energy into , A , trying to come up with alternative fuels and , B , you know , we just launched this prize , which is really a prize in case we do n't get an answer on alternative fuels , in case we do n't actually manage to get the carbon emissions cut down quickly , and in case we go through the tipping point . 
We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way of extracting carbon out of the Earth 's atmosphere . 
And we just -- you know , there were n't really people working on that before , so we wanted people to try to -- all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that , and also to try to extract the methane out of the Earth 's atmosphere as well . 
And actually , we 've had about 15,000 people fill in the forms saying they want to give it a go . 
And so we only need one , so we 're hopeful . 
CA : And you 're also working in Africa on a couple of projects ? 
RB : Yes , I mean , we 've got -- we 're setting up something called the war room , which is maybe the wrong word . 
We 're trying to -- maybe we 'll change it -- but anyway , it 's a war room to try to coordinate all the attack that 's going on in Africa , all the different social problems in Africa , and try to look at best practices . 
So , for instance , there 's a doctor in Africa that 's found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks , when she 's pregnant , that the baby will not have HIV when it 's born . 
And so disseminating that information to around the rest of Africa is important . 
CA : The war room sounds , it sounds powerful and dramatic . 
And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West get so excited about -- I mean , they 're used to having an idea , getting stuff done , and they believe profoundly in their ability to make a difference in the world . 
Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say , we 've got to fix this problem and we can do it , I 've got all these billions of dollars , you know , da , da , da -- here 's the big idea . And kind of take a much more complex situation and actually end up making a mess of it . Do you worry about that ? 
RB : Well , first of all , on this particular situation , we 're actually -- we 're working with the government on it . 
I mean , Thabo Mbeki 's had his problems with accepting HIV and AIDS are related , but this is a way , I think , of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him , it 's a way of working with him , with his government . 
It 's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help , they do n't just go in there and then leave after a few years . 
It 's got to be consistent . 
But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know - how and help governments approach things slightly differently . 
For instance , we 're setting up clinics in Africa where we 're going to be giving free antiretroviral drugs , free TB treatment and free malaria treatment . 
But we 're also trying to make them self - sustaining clinics , so that people pay for some other aspects . 
CA : I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself , or Bill Gates , or whatever , that this is really being -- it 's almost driven by some sort of desire again , you know , for the right image , for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct . 
What would you say to them ? 
RB : Well , I think that everybody -- people do things for a whole variety of different reasons and I think that , you know , when I 'm on me deathbed , I will want to feel that I 've made a difference to other people 's lives . 
And that may be a selfish thing to think , but it 's the way I 've been brought up . 
I think if I 'm in a position to radically change other people 's lives for the better , I should do so . 
CA : How old are you ? 
RB : I 'm 56 . 
CA : I mean , the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand him and I 'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s , 40s people are driven by this desire to grow and that 's where they get their fulfillment . 
50s , 60s , the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom and a search for legacy . 
I mean , it seems like you 're still a little bit in the growth phases , you 're still doing these incredible new plans . 
How much do you think about legacy , and what would you like your legacy to be ? 
RB : I do n't think I think too much about legacy . 
I mean , I like to -- you know , my grandmother lived to 101 , so hopefully I 've got another 30 or 40 years to go . 
No , I just want to live life to its full . 
You know , if I can make a difference , I hope to be able to make a difference . 
And I think one of the positive things at the moment is you 've got Sergey and Larry from Google , for instance , who are good friends . 
And , thank God , you 've got two people who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth . 
If they had that kind of wealth and they did n't care about the world , it would be very worrying . 
And you know they 're going to make a hell of a difference to the world . 
And I think it 's important that people in that kind of position do make a difference . 
CA : Well , Richard , when I was starting off in business , I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of -- I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding . 
And you actually did inspire me . I looked at you , I thought , well , he 's made it . Maybe there is a different way . 
So I would like to thank you for that inspiration , and for coming to TED today . Thank you . 
Thank you so much .

Alwar Balasubramaniam : Art of substance and absence 
The moment I say " school , " so many memories come back to me . 
It 's like after every exam , when I walk out , the teacher would say , " Hey , come . 
How did you do ? " 
I would say with a great smile , " I will definitely pass . " 
And I did n't understand why , in one hand they say , " Speak the truth , " in the other hand , when you say the truth , they hated you . 
So it went on like that , and I did n't know where else to find myself . 
So I remember those nights I used to go to sleep with asking help from [ the ] Unknown because , for some reason , I could n't believe what my father and mother hanged in the Puja room as a god , because my friend 's family had something else as a god . 
So I thought , " I guess I 'll pray to [ the ] Unknown and ask help , " and started getting help from everywhere , each and every corner of my life at that time . 
My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting . 
Then , when I was in eighth standard around 13 years old , I started working in a part - time job in one of the signboard artists called Putu . 
And then school also started supporting me . 
" Oh , he 's bad at studies , but let him send to the drawing competitions . " 
So it was good to survive with that little tool that I found to find my own place in school . 
And one of those competitions , I just won a small , little transistor Philips radio . 
And I did n't have the patience to wait until I reached home . 
So I just switched on in the train , loudly . 
If you travel in Indian trains , you can see people listening to radio and , you know , even from their mobiles . 
So at that time -- and I was 13 -- and I was listening to just radio , and someone happened to sit next to me , like these three people are sitting here . 
You know , like just adjacent to me . 
He just started asking , " Where did you buy the radio ? How much is it ? " 
I said , " It 's a prize from [ an ] art competition . " 
And he said , " Oh , I teach at a college of arts . 
I think you should study in a school of art . 
You just quit school and come there . " 
So , why I 'm telling you this , you know , maybe , you know , whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it 's possible . 
It is that we need we need to be open and fine - tuned . 
So that 's what made me enter [ the ] college of arts after three attempts and just continue to inquire what I really want to do with art work , or art and finally I 'm here in front of you . 
When I look back , you know , on what happened between that time and now here -- the last 10/15 years -- I can see that most of the works revolve around three subjects , but it was not intentional . 
And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking , " What really makes us ? " -- you know , it 's actually [ the ] past , what makes a person . 
So I was thinking , but when you look at the past , the way to understand the past is only by the traces available , because we can not go back [ to ] the past . 
It can be ruins , or it can be music , or it can be painting or drawing or writing , whatever it is . 
But it is just a kind of trace of that time . 
And that fascinated me , to explore that territory . 
So I was working on the line , but instead of working about traces , I started capturing traces . 
So here are some of the works I would like to show you . 
So this is called " Self In Progress . " 
It 's just a trace of being in this body . 
So here , what happened then , you know -- what I really enjoyed the most is that this sculpture is nothing but a trace of myself . 
It 's almost like a 3D photograph . 
So there is an element of performance , and there is an element of sculpture , and there is an element of feeling one 's self , so close to one 's self . 
So it 's almost like fossils for the future . 
And then moved slowly to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces . 
So this is what I was talking about , while molding , it 's such a great experience , because we have freedom of like walking , or moving my hand or , moving around in the space , but the moment this becomes solid , when you can not move even an inch , because this is plaster of Paris , so the moment you pour it it 's like liquid ; but after 20 minutes , it 's almost like a hard stone . 
So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because , knowingly or unknowingly , whatever we do , you know , we leave our traces here . 
So I just thought , " I 'm going to capture thumbprint , footprint , or whatever traces we leave as humans . " 
This is the trace of fire , this is the trace of sun . 
Because when I was capturing traces , you know , this thought comes to me always : is it , only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace , or is there other ways to capture it ? " 
So this work is nothing but like -- because of the focal length of the lens , it just shows what is on the other side . 
So I just put the paper on the focal length , which was an etching print , then I got the portrait of [ the ] sun from sunlight . 
This is called " Dawn to Dawn . " 
What I did here , I just put like 10 feet [ of ] paper then put a coconut rope , and just burnt it . 
So it took about 24 hours to get this line . 
So wherever the fire is eating the paper , that 's what becomes the work -- detail . 
Even though we have traces when we try to understand them , the perception and context play a major role to understand it . 
So do we really understand what it is , or are we trying to get what we think it is ? 
Then move towards questioning the perception because , even though there are traces , when you try to understand them , you know you play a major role . 
So like let 's say even a simple act . 
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore ? 
Can you just raise the hand ? 
If you just ask an opinion of how , everyone can interpret it . 
Like , let 's say , if a schoolteacher says , she 'll simply say , " To get to the other side . " 
Why the cow was crossing the road , you know . 
The answer can be so different if Potter said it . 
He would say , " For the greater good . " 
Martin Luther King would say , " I imagine a world where all cows will be free to cross the road , without having their motives called into question . " 
Imagine Moses comes now , and he sees the same cow walking around the street . 
He would definitely say , " God came down from heaven , and he said unto the cow , ' Thou shalt cross the road . ' And cow crossed the road , and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow . " 
Freud would say , " The fact that you 're at all concerned reveals your underlying sexual insecurity . " 
If we ask Einstein , he would say , " Whether the cow crossed the road , or the road moved underneath the cow , depends on your frame of reference . " 
Or Buddha -- if he saw the same cow , he would say , " Asking this question denies your own nature [ as a ] cow . " 
So , what we see is just what we think often , and most of the time , we do n't see what it is . 
It just all depends on one 's perception . 
And context , what is really context ? 
You know , I could just show you this little piece of paper . 
Because I always think meaning does n't really exist . 
The meaning of what we create in this world does n't exist . 
It 's just created by the mind . 
If you look at this piece of paper , this is the breadth and this is called length . 
This is how we 've been taught in school . 
But if you tear it in the middle -- now , I did n't touch this breadth , but still , the meaning of this changes . 
So what we conceive as a meaning is always not there ; it 's on the other side , even when we say dark , light , good , bad , tall , short -- all meaning it does n't exist in reality . 
It 's just that being a human , the way we train to perceive the reality creates this meaning . 
So this work from this period is mostly like -- you know , this is a work called " Light Makes Dark . " 
It 's just captured through from the lamp . 
So the lamp is not just giving a light , it 's also giving a darkness . 
So this is a work of art , which is just trying to explore that . 
This is called " Limit Out . " 
This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch -- do we really see ? 
This is an exact negative . 
It 's about six inches deep in the wall , but it just appears like it 's coming out of the wall . 
You know the wall is almost like -- this is the first skin , and this is the second , and there 's a third , and each creates a meaning . 
And we 're just pulling the wall off the gallery . 
Again , " Inward Out . " 
It 's a full - figure cast from myself . 
It 's about eight inches deep . 
When I was doing that , I always wondered since I 've worked with creators -- and now you know , I 've moved to questioning the perception -- whenever I see the bird flying in the sky , it just makes me feel like : is there anything behind , are there any traces up there , which as a human , we do n't see them ? 
Is there any way to capture the thought into visual art ? 
I could n't find it . 
But a solution arrived after being quiet and not working for about six , seven months , in the restroom , when I was changing the air freshener that goes from solid substance to vapor . 
It 's called Odonil . 
This is the work I made out of that material . 
The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting , because I wrote to Balsara , who produces that air freshener called Odonil , saying , " Dear Sir , I am an artist . This is my catalogue . 
Will you help me to make this sculpture ? " 
They never wrote back to me . 
Then I thought , " I will go to the Small Scale Industries Facilitating Unit and ask help . " 
So I told them , " I 'd like to start an air freshener company . " 
They said , " Of course . 
This is the fee for the project report , and we will give you all the details , " and they gave . 
Finally , I went back to them and said , " It 's not for starting the company , it 's just to make my own work . 
Please come for the show . " 
And they did . 
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi . 
In India , nobody really talks about works of art ; they always talk about the appreciation of art . 
You buy this for 3,000 rupees , it 'll become 30,000 in two months . 
This is the craft that was going on , but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate . 
And this was collected by Anapum -- which is like , finally in the end , he will not have anything , because it will evaporate . 
So this is after a few weeks , this is after a few months . 
It 's just all about questioning the preconceptions . 
So if someone says , " Oh , I see the portrait , " it may not be the portrait after a few months . 
And if they say it 's solid , it will not be solid , it will evaporate . 
And if they say they do n't get it , that 's also not true , because it 's in the air . 
It 's in the same gallery or in the same museum . 
So they inhaled it , but they are not aware of it . 
While I was doing that work , my mom and my dad , they were looking at it and they said , " Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time ? " 
And I was like , " What do you mean ? " 
" Light makes dark and now evaporating self . 
Do n't you think it remained something about death , " they said . 
" Of course not . For me , " I 'm thinking , " this is tucked in some small solid , but the moment it evaporates , it 's merged with the whole . " 
But she said , " No . Still , I do n't like it . 
Can you make something from nothing as a sculptor ? " 
I said , " No , mom . It ca n't be . 
Because we can create a sculpture by gathering dust together , or we can break the sculpture and get the dust , but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe . " 
So , I did this work for her . 
It 's called " Emerging Angel . " 
This is the first day -- it just gives the appearance that one is becoming the other . 
So , the same sculpture after a few days . 
This is after 15/20 days . 
Through that small little slit between the glass box and the wood , the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one . 
This gave me a greater faith . 
That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture [ the ] invisible . 
So what you see now is called " Shadow Foreshadow . " 
And what I 'd like to tell you is we do n't see shadow , and we do n't see light too ; we see the source of the light . 
We see where it 's bouncing , but we do n't see [ them ] as they exist . 
You know , that 's why the night sky , we see the sky as dark , but it 's filled with light all the time . 
When it 's bounced on the moon , we see it . 
The same thing in the darkroom . 
The little dust particle will again , reflect the light , and we realize the existence of light . 
So we do n't see dark , we do n't see light , we do n't see gravity , we do n't see electricity . 
So , I just started doing this work to inquire further about how to sculpt the space between this object and there . 
Because , as a visual artist , if I 'm seeing this and I 'm seeing that -- but how to sculpt this , you know ? 
If we sculpt this , this has two reference points . 
The skin of this is also representing this . 
And skin at the other end also represents the floor . 
I did this as an experiment of casting the shadow . 
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow . 
Then the second one -- the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence . 
So that produced a shadow . 
Then I thought , okay , let me sculpt that . 
Then , again , that becomes an object . 
Again , throwing light , then the third one . 
So what you see is nothing but shadow of a shadow of a shadow . 
And then again , at that point , there is no shadow . 
I thought , " Oh , good . Work is finished . " 
You can see the detail . 
This is called " Gravity . " 
It 's called " Breath . " It 's just two holes on the gallery wall . 
It 's a false wall , which contains like 110 cubic feet . 
So that hole actually makes the air come out and go in . 
So where it 's happening , we can see , but what is happening will remain invisible only . 
This is from the show called " Invisible , " at Talwar Gallery . 
This is called " Kaayam . " 
Detail . 
And what I 'd like to tell you , our senses are so limited -- we can not hear everything , we can not see everything . 
We do n't feel , " I am touching the air , " but if the breeze is a little more faster , then I can feel it . 
So all of our construction of reality is through these limited senses . 
So my recourse was like , is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign ? 
And to really get to the point , we should move beyond , you know , go to the other side of the wall , like in logic , like are invisible . 
Because when we see someone walks , we see the footprint . 
But if we 're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it , you will miss the point because the actual journey happens between those footprints , and the footprints are nothing but passing time . 
Thank you .

Physics and marketing do n't seem to have much in common , but Dan Cobley is passionate about both . He brings these unlikely bedfellows together using Newton 's second law , Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle , the scientific method and the second law of thermodynamics to explain the fundamental theories of branding . 
business , marketing , math , physics

Dan Cobley : What physics taught me about marketing 
So I work in marketing , which I love , but my first passion was physics , a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when I had a little less gray hair . 
So he taught me that physics is cool because it teaches us so much about the world around us . 
And I 'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you that physics can teach us something about marketing . 
So quick show of hands -- who studied some marketing in university ? 
Who studied some physics in university ? 
Pretty good . And at school ? 
Okay , lots of you . 
So , hopefully this will bring back some happy , or possibly some slightly disturbing memories . 
So , physics and marketing . 
We 'll start with something very simple -- Newton 's Law : " The force equals mass times acceleration . " 
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign . 
But if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction . 
It 's the same with brands : the more massive a brand , the more baggage it has , the more force is needed to change its positioning . 
And that 's one of the reasons why Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture rather than try to persuade the world that Andersen 's could stand for something other than accountancy . 
It explains why Hoover found it very difficult to persuade the world that it was more than vacuum cleaners , and why companies like Unilever and P&G keep brands separate , like Ariel and Pringles and Dove rather than having one giant parent brand . 
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object the more force is needed to change its direction . 
The marketing is , the bigger a brand , the more difficult it is to reposition it . 
So think about a portfolio of brands or maybe new brands for new ventures . 
Now , who remembers Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle ? 
Getting a little more technical now . 
So this says that it 's impossible , by definition , to measure exactly the state -- i.e. , the position -- and the momentum of a particle , because the act of measuring it , by definition , changes it . 
So to explain that -- if you 've got an elementary particle and you shine a light on it , then the photon of light has momentum , which knocks the particle , so you do n't know where it was before you looked at it . 
By measuring it , the act of measurement changes it . 
The act of observation changes it . 
It 's the same in marketing . 
So with the act of observing consumers , changes their behavior . 
Think about the group of moms who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group , and almost none of them buy lots of junk food . 
And yet , McDonald 's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year . 
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets , who stuff their trolleys full of fresh green vegetables and fruit , but do n't shop like that any other day . 
And if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the Web , it 's very few . 
Yet , at Google , we know it 's the number - one searched for category . 
So luckily , the science -- no , sorry -- the marketing is getting easier . 
Luckily , with now better point - of - sale tracking , more digital media consumption , you can measure more what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they do . 
So the physics is you can never accurately and exactly measure a particle , because the observation changes it . 
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they 'll do or anticipate they 'll do . 
So next , the scientific method -- an axiom of physics , of all science -- says you can not prove a hypothesis through observation , you can only disprove it . 
What this means is you can gather more and more data around a hypothesis or a positioning , and it will strengthen it , but it will not conclusively prove it . 
And only one contrary data point can blow your theory out of the water . 
So if we take an example -- Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory that the planets would rotate around the Earth . 
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus to blow that idea out of the water . 
And there are parallels for marketing -- you can invest for a long time in a brand , but a single contrary observation of that positioning will destroy consumers ' belief . 
Take BP -- they spent millions of pounds over many years building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand , but then one little accident . 
Think about Toyota . 
It was , for a long time , revered as the most reliable of cars , and then they had the big recall incident . 
And Tiger Woods , for a long time , the perfect brand ambassador . 
Well , you know the story . 
So the physics is that you can not prove a hypothesis , but it 's easy to disprove it -- any hypothesis is shaky . 
And the marketing is that not matter how much you 've invested in your brand , one bad week can undermine decades of good work . 
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw - ups that can undermine your brand . 
And lastly , to the slightly obscure world of entropy -- the second law of thermodynamics . 
This says that entropy , which is a measure of the disorder of a system , will always increase . 
The same is true of marketing . 
If we go back 20 years , the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager could pretty much define a brand . 
But where we are today , things have changed . 
You can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the Conservative Party did earlier this year with their election poster . 
But then you lose control of it . 
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools that are available now to every consumer , it 's impossible to control where it goes . 
Your brand starts being dispersed , it gets more chaotic . 
It 's out of your control . 
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job . 
But while this may be unsettling for marketers , it 's actually a good thing . 
This distribution of brand energy gets your brand closer to the people , more in with the people . 
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force , which is ultimately good for your brand . 
So , the lesson from physics is that entropy will always increase ; it 's a fundamental law . 
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed . 
You ca n't fight it , so embrace it and find a way to work with it . 
So to close , my teacher , Mr. Vutter , told me that physics is cool , and hopefully , I 've convinced you that physics can teach all of us , even in the world of marketing , something special . 
Thank you .

Marisa Fick - Jordan shares the wonder of Zulu wire art 
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa dates back hundreds of years . 
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material , in the form of telephone wire . 
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials started to replace hard - to - come - by natural grasses . 
So , here you can see the change from use -- starting to use contemporary materials . 
These pieces date back from the ' 40s to the late ' 50s . 
In the ' 90s , my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form , which came from a squatter camp outside Durban . 
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point , and started developing , really , and mentoring them in terms of scale , in terms of the design . 
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year . 
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards , what they could provide , so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us , and not only to supply the materials on bobbins , but to produce to our color specifications . 
At the same time , I was thinking , well , there 's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary . 
So I developed a whole range around -- mass - produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher - end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market . 
We started experimenting , as you can see , in terms of shapes , forms . The scale became very important , and it 's become our pet project . It 's successful , it 's been running for 12 years . And we supply the Conran shops , and Donna Karan , and so it 's kind of great . 
This is our group , our main group of weavers . 
They come on a weekly basis to Durban . 
They all have bank accounts . 
They 've all moved back to the rural area where they came from . 
It 's a weekly turnaround of production . 
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of . 
And that 's also modernized today , and it 's supporting work for 300 weavers . 
And the rest says it all . 
Thank you very much .

Caroline Phillips : Hurdy - gurdy for beginners 
Now , since this is TEDGlobal , who can tell me what this is called in French ? 
I see you 're all up on the history of hurdy - gurdy -- " vielle à roue . " 
And in Spanish , " zanfona . " 
And in Italian , " ghironda , " okay ? 
Hurdy - gurdy , or wheel fiddle . 
So , these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy - gurdy . 
The hurdy - gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a crank to turn a wheel to rub strings , like the bow of a violin , to produce music . 
It has three different kinds of strings . 
The first string is the drone string , which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe . 
The second string is a melody string , which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano . 
And the third string is pretty innovative . 
It 's also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique . 
It activates what 's called the buzzing bridge , or the dog . 
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure , it makes a sound like a barking dog . 
So all of this is pretty innovative , if you consider that the hurdy - gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago and it took two people to play it ; one to turn the crank , and another person -- yes -- to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs . 
Luckily , all of this changed a couple of centuries later . 
So , one person could actually play and almost -- this is pretty heavy -- carry the hurdy - gurdy . 
The hurdy - gurdy has been used , historically , through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the melody combined with the acoustic boombox here . 
And today , the hurdy - gurdy is used in all sorts of music -- traditional folk music , dance , contemporary and world music -- in the U.K. , in France , in Spain and in Italy . 
And this kind of hurdy - gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [ to order and receive it ] . 
It 's made by specialized luthiers , also in Europe . 
And it 's very difficult to tune . 
So without further ado , would you like to hear it ? 
Caroline Phillips : I did n't hear you . Would you like to hear it ? 
CP : Okay . 
There I go . 
I 'd like to sing in Basque , which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live , in the region in France and Spain . 
[ Basque ] Thank you . 
This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms . 
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel . 
Thank you . Thank you .

Helen Fisher tells us why we love + cheat 
I 'd like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century , and perhaps in the next 10,000 years . 
But I want to start with my work on romantic love , because that 's my most recent work . 
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were madly in love , into a functional MRI brain scanner . 
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted ; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped . 
And so I want to tell you about that first , and then go on into where I think love is going . 
" What ' tis to love ? " Shakespeare said . 
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago . 
I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psychological research -- and as it turns out , there 's a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love . 
The first thing that happens is what I call -- a person begins to take on what I call , " special meaning . " 
As a truck driver once said to me , he said , " The world had a new center , and that center was Mary Anne . " 
George Bernard Shaw said it a little differently . 
He said , " Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another . " 
And indeed , that 's what we do . 
And then you just focus on this person . 
You can list what you do n't like about them , but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do . 
As Chaucer said , " Love is blind . " 
In trying to understand romantic love , I decided I would read poetry from all over the world , and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth - century China , because it 's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman . 
It 's a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different from every other car in the parking lot . 
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party . 
And in this case , a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat . 
And it goes like this . It 's by a guy called Yuan Chen : " I can not bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat . 
The night I brought you home , I watched you roll it out . " 
He became hooked on a sleeping mat , probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain , just like with you and me . 
But anyway , not only does this person take on special meaning , you focus your attention on them . 
You aggrandize them . But you have intense energy . 
As one Polynesian said , he said , " I felt like jumping in the sky . " 
You 're up all night . You 're walking till dawn . 
You feel intense elation when things are going well ; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly . 
Real dependence on this person . 
As one businessman in New York said to me , he said , " Anything she liked , I liked . " 
Simple . Romantic love is very simple . 
You become extremely sexually possessive . 
You know , if you 're just sleeping with somebody casually , you do n't really care if they 're sleeping with somebody else . 
But the moment you fall in love , you become extremely sexually possessive of them . 
I think that that is a Darwinian -- there 's a Darwinian purpose to this . 
The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team . 
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving : an intense craving to be with a particular person , not just sexually , but emotionally . 
You 'd much rather -- it would be nice to go to bed with them , but you want them to call you on the telephone , to invite you out , etc . , to tell you that they love you . 
The other main characteristic is motivation . 
The motor in your brain begins to crank , and you want this person . 
And last but not least , it is an obsession . 
When I put these people in the machine , before I put them in the MRI machine , I would ask them all kinds of questions . 
But my most important question was always the same . 
It was : " What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person ? " 
And indeed , they would say , " All day . All night . I can never stop thinking about him or her . " 
And then , the very last question I would ask them -- I would always have to work myself up to this question , because I am not a psychologist . 
I do n't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation . 
And my final question was always the same . 
I would say , " Would you die for him or her ? " 
And , indeed , these people would say " Yes ! " 
as if I had asked them to pass the salt . 
I was just staggered by it . 
So we scanned their brains , looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph , with a distraction task in between . 
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state . 
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions . 
In fact , one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine . 
And indeed , that 's exactly what happens . 
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion . 
In fact , I had always thought it was a series of emotions , from very high to very low . 
But actually , it 's a drive . It comes from the motor of the mind , the wanting part of the mind , the craving part of the mind . 
The kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you 're reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work . 
The motor of the brain . It 's a drive . 
And in fact , I think it 's more powerful than the sex drive . 
You know , if you ask somebody to go to bed with you , and they say , " No , thank you , " you certainly do n't kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression . 
But certainly , around the world , people who are rejected in love will kill for it . 
People live for love . They kill for love . They die for love . 
They have songs , poems , novels , sculptures , paintings , myths , legends . 
In over 175 societies , people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system . 
I have come to think it 's one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow . 
And I 've also come to think that it 's one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction . 
One is the sex drive : the craving for sexual gratification . 
W.H. Auden called it an " intolerable neural itch , " and indeed , that 's what it is . 
It keeps bothering you a little bit , like being hungry . 
The second of these three brain systems is romantic love : that elation , obsession of early love . 
And the third brain system is attachment : that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long - term partner . 
And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there , looking for a whole range of partners . 
You know , you can feel it when you 're just driving along in your car . 
It can be focused on nobody . 
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time , thereby conserving mating time and energy . 
And I think that attachment , the third brain system , evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- -- at least long enough to raise a child together as a team . 
So with that preamble , I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends . 
One of the last 10,000 years and the other , certainly of the last 25 years , that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems : lust , romantic love and deep attachment to a partner . 
The first is women working , moving into the workforce . 
I 've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations . 
And everywhere in the world , 129 out of 130 of them , women are not only moving into the job market -- sometimes very , very slowly , but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power , health and education . 
It 's very slow . 
For every trend on this planet , there 's a counter - trend . 
We all know of them , but nevertheless -- the Arabs say , " The dogs may bark , but the caravan moves on . " 
And , indeed , that caravan is moving on . 
Women are moving back into the job market . 
And I say back into the job market , because this is not new . 
For millions of years , on the grasslands of Africa , women commuted to work to gather their vegetables . 
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal . 
The double income family was the standard . 
And women were regarded as just as economically , socially and sexually powerful as men . 
In short , we 're really moving forward to the past . 
Then , women 's worst invention was the plow . 
With the beginning of plow agriculture , men 's roles became extremely powerful . 
Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors , but then with the industrial revolution and the post - industrial revolution they 're moving back into the job market . 
In short , they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago . 
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal . 
And it 's going to have an impact . 
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community . 
I 'll only just say a couple of things , and then go on to sex and love . 
There 's a lot of gender differences ; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child . 
I do n't know why it is that they want to think that men and women are alike . 
There 's much we have in common , but there 's a whole lot that we do not have in common . 
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes , " I think that we were built to be -- we 're like two feet . We need each other to get ahead . " 
But we did not evolve to have the same brain . 
And we 're finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain . 
I 'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love . 
One of them is women 's verbal ability . Women can talk . 
Women 's ability to find the right word rapidly , basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle , when estrogen levels peak . 
But even at menstruation , they 're better than the average man . 
Women can talk . 
They 've been doing it for a million years ; words were women 's tools . 
They held that baby in front of their face , cajoling it , reprimanding it , educating it with words . 
And , indeed , they 're becoming a very powerful force . 
Even in places like India and Japan , where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market , they 're moving into journalism . 
And I think that the television is like the global campfire . 
We sit around it and it shapes our minds . 
Almost always , when I 'm on TV , the producers who call me , who negotiate what we 're going to say , is a woman . 
In fact , Solzhenitsyn once said , " To have a great writer is to have another government . " 
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women . 
It 's one of many , many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market . 
They 've got incredible people skills , negotiating skills . 
They 're highly imaginative . 
We now know the brain circuitry of imagination , of long - term planning . 
They tend to be web thinkers . 
Because the female parts of the brain are better connected , they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think , put them into more complex patterns , see more options and outcomes . 
They tend to be contextual , holistic thinkers , what I call web thinkers . 
Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous , focus on what they do , and move in a more step - by - step thinking pattern . 
They 're both perfectly good ways of thinking . 
We need both of them to get ahead . 
In fact , there 's many more male geniuses in the world . 
When the -- and there 's also many more male idiots in the world . 
When the male brain works well , it works extremely well . 
And what I really think that we 're doing is , we 're moving towards a collaborative society , a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed . 
But in fact , women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life . 
Foremost , women are starting to express their sexuality . 
I 'm always astonished when people come to me and say , " Why is it that men are so adulterous ? " 
And I say , " Why do you think more men are adulterous than women ? " 
" Oh , well -- men are more adulterous ! " 
And I say , " Who do you think these men are sleeping with ? " 
And -- basic math ! 
Anyway . 
In the Western world , women start sooner at sex , have more partners , express less remorse for the partners that they do , marry later , have fewer children , leave bad marriages in order to get good ones . 
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression . 
And , indeed , once again we 're moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago , because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today . 
We 're also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality . 
They 're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the " symmetrical marriage , " or the " pure marriage , " or the " companionate marriage . " 
This is a marriage between equals , moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit . 
We 're also seeing a rise of romantic love . 
91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner , if they were not in love with that person . 
People around the world , in a study of 37 societies , want to be in love with the person that they marry . 
Indeed , arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life . 
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend . 
The first one being women moving into the job market , the second one being the aging world population . 
They 're now saying that in America , that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85 . 
Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85 , as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them . 
So we 're seeing there 's a real extension of middle age . 
And I looked -- for one of my books , I looked at divorce data in 58 societies . 
And as it turns out , the older you get , the less likely you are to divorce . 
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America , and it 's actually beginning to decline . 
It may decline some more . 
I would even say that with Viagra , estrogen replacement , hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women -- women have never been as interesting as they are now . 
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated , so interesting , so capable . 
And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages , that time is now . 
However , there 's always kinds of complications in this . 
In these three brain systems : lust , romantic love and attachment -- do n't always go together . 
They can go together , by the way . 
That 's why casual sex is n't so casual . 
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine . 
Dopamine 's associated with romantic love , and you can just fall in love with somebody who you 're just having casual sex with . 
With orgasm , then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment . 
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you 've made love to them . 
But these three brain systems : lust , romantic love and attachment , are n't always connected to each other . 
You can feel deep attachment to a long - term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else , while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners . 
In short , we 're capable of loving more than one person at a time . 
In fact , you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else . 
It 's as if there 's a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do . 
So I do n't think , honestly , we 're an animal that was built to be happy ; we are an animal that was built to reproduce . 
I think the happiness we find , we make . 
And I think , however , we can make good relationships with each other . 
So I want to conclude with two things . 
I want to conclude with a worry -- I have a worry -- and with a wonderful story . 
The worry is about antidepressants . 
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States . 
And these drugs are going generic . 
They are seeping around the world . 
I know one girl who 's been on these antidepressants , serotonin - enhancing -- SSRI , serotonin - enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13 . 
She 's 23 . She 's been on them ever since she was 13 . 
I 've got nothing against people who take them short term , when they 're going through something perfectly horrible . 
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else . 
I would recommend it . 
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term . 
And indeed , what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin . 
And by raising levels of serotonin , you suppress the dopamine circuit . 
Everybody knows that . 
Dopamine is associated with romantic love . 
Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit , but they kill the sex drive . 
And when you kill the sex drive , you kill orgasm . 
And when you kill orgasm , you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment . 
The things are connected in the brain . 
And when you tamper with one brain system , you 're going to tamper with another . 
I 'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place . 
So now -- -- thank you . 
I want to end with a story . And then , just a comment . 
I 've been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years . 
I 'm an identical twin ; I am interested in why we 're all alike . 
Why you and I are alike , why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike . 
And about a year ago , an Internet dating service , Match.com , came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them . 
I said , " I do n't know anything about personality . You know ? 
I do n't know . Do you think you 've got the right person ? " 
They said , " Yes . " 
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another . 
That 's my current project ; it will be my next book . 
There 's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another . 
Timing is important . Proximity is important . 
Mystery is important . You fall in love with somebody who 's somewhat mysterious , in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain , probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love . 
You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your " love map , " an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up . 
And I also think that you gravitate to certain people , actually , with somewhat complementary brain systems . 
And that 's what I 'm now contributing to this . 
But I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate . 
I 've been carrying on here about the biology of love . 
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it , too -- the magic of it . 
It 's a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the -- probably a true story . 
It was a graduate student at -- I 'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues -- Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook . 
That 's where we put our people in the MRI machine . 
And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student , and she was not in love with him . 
And they were all at a conference in Beijing . 
And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody , you can drive up the dopamine in the brain , and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love . 
So he decided he 'd put science to work , and he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him . 
And sure enough -- I 've never been in one , but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it 's crazy and it 's noisy and it 's exciting . 
And he figured that this would drive up the dopamine , and she would fall in love with him . 
So off they go and she 's squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time . 
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw , and she throws her hands up and she says , " Was n't that wonderful ? " 
And , " Was n't that rickshaw driver handsome ! " 
There 's magic to love ! 
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago , we evolved three basic drives : the sex drive , romantic love and attachment to a long - term partner . 
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain . 
They 're going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called " this mortal coil . " 
Thank you .

Bill Ford is a car guy -- his great - grandfather was Henry Ford , and he grew up inside the massive Ford Motor Co. So when he worries about cars ' impact on the environment , and about our growing global gridlock problem , it 's worth a listen . His vision for the future of mobility includes " smart roads , " even smarter public transport and going green like never before .

Bill Ford : A future beyond traffic gridlock 
By birth and by choice , I 've been involved with the auto industry my entire life , and for the past 30 years , I 've worked at Ford Motor Company . 
And for most of those years , I worried about , how am I going to sell more cars and trucks ? 
But today I worry about , what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks ? 
What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles , triples , or even quadruples ? 
My life is guided by two great passions , and the first is automobiles . 
I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company . 
I thought it was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln and leave it in the driveway . 
And I decided about that time , about age 10 , that it would be really cool if I was a test driver . 
So my parents would go to dinner . 
They 'd sit down ; I 'd sneak out of the house . 
I 'd jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway , and it was a blast . 
And that went on for about two years , until -- I think I was about 12 -- my dad brought home a Lincoln Mark III . 
And it was snowing that day . 
So he and mom went to dinner , and I snuck out and thought it 'd be really cool to do donuts or even some figure - eights in the snow . 
My dad finished dinner early that evening . 
And he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time I hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car -- and almost ended up in the front hall . 
So it kind of cooled my test - driving for a little while . 
But I really began to love cars then . 
And my first car was a 1975 electric - green Mustang . 
And even though the color was pretty hideous , I did love the car , and it really cemented my love affair with cars that 's continued on to this day . 
But cars are really more than a passion of mine ; they 're quite literally in my blood . 
My great grandfather was Henry Ford , and on my mother 's side , my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone . 
So when I was born , I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me . 
But my great grandfather , Henry Ford , really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company was to make people 's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them . 
Because he believed that with mobility comes freedom and progress . 
And that 's a belief that I share . 
My other great passion is the environment . 
And as a young boy , I used to go up to Northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about . 
And it really struck me as the years went by , in a very negative way , when I would go to some stream that I 'd loved , and was used to walking through this field that was once filled with fireflies , and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it . 
And so even at a young age , that really resonated with me , and the whole notion of environmental preservation , at a very basic level , sunk in with me . 
As a high - schooler , I started to read authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold and Edward Abbey , and I really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world . 
But it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and trucks would ever be in conflict with nature . 
And that was true until I got to college . 
And when I got to college , you can imagine my surprise when I would go to class and a number of my professors would say that Ford Motor Company and my family was everything that was wrong with our country . 
They thought that we were more interested , as an industry , in profits , rather than progress , and that we filled the skies with smog -- and frankly , we were the enemy . 
I joined Ford after college , after some soul searching whether or not this is really the right thing to do . 
But I decided that I wanted to go and see if I could affect change there . 
And as I look back over 30 years ago , it was a little naive to think at that age that I could . But I wanted to . 
And I really discovered that my professors were n't completely wrong . 
In fact , when I got back to Detroit , my environmental leanings were n't exactly embraced by those in my own company , and certainly by those in the industry . 
I had some very interesting conversations , as you can imagine . 
There were some within Ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that I needed to stop hanging out with " environmental wackos . " 
I was considered a radical . 
And I 'll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists . 
Of course , I had no intention of doing that , and I kept speaking out about the environment , and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability . 
And in time , my views went from controversial to more or less consensus today . 
I mean , I think most people in the industry understand that we 've got to get on with it . 
And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues , of cars and the environment -- not only at Ford , but really as an industry . 
We 're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights . 
And with new technology , we 're reducing -- and I believe , someday we 'll eliminate -- CO2 emissions . 
We 're starting to sell electric cars , which is great . 
We 're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make cars affordable in every sense of the word -- economically , socially and environmentally . 
And actually , although we 've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do , I can see the day where my two great passions -- cars and the environment -- actually come into harmony . 
But unfortunately , as we 're on our way to solving one monstrous problem -- and as I said , we 're not there yet ; we 've got a lot of work to do , but I can see where we will -- but even as we 're in the process of doing that , another huge problem is looming , and people are n't noticing . 
And that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened , just as the environment is . 
The problem , put in its simplest terms , is one of mathematics . 
Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world , and within our lifetime , that number 's going to grow to about nine billion . 
And at that population level , our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth . 
And with that growth comes some severe practical problems , one of which is our transportation system simply wo n't be able to deal with it . 
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars , it becomes even clearer . 
Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide . 
But with more people and greater prosperity around the world , that number 's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid century . 
And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before . 
Now think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives . 
Today the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams , and that 's a huge waste of time and resources . 
But that 's nothing compared to what 's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest . 
Today the average driver in Beijing has a five - hour commute . 
And last summer -- many of you probably saw this -- there was a hundred - mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China . 
In the decades to come , 75 percent of the world 's population will live in cities , and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more . 
So you can see the size of the issue that we 're facing . 
When you factor in population growth , it 's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow . 
Frankly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars , and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam . 
So , if we make no changes today , what does tomorrow look like ? 
Well I think you probably already have the picture . 
Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge , and they 're really very , very inconvenient , but that 's all they are . 
But the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care , particularly to people that live in city centers . 
And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised . 
So what 's going to solve this ? 
Well the answer is n't going to be more of the same . 
My great grandfather once said before he invented the Model T , " If I had asked people then what they wanted , they would have answered , ' We want faster horses . ' " So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads . 
When America began moving west , we did n't add more wagon trains , we built railroads . 
And to connect our country after World War II , we did n't build more two - lane highways , we built the interstate highway system . 
Today we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future . 
We are going to build smart cars , but we also need to build smart roads , smart parking , smart public transportation systems and more . 
We do n't want to waste our time sitting in traffic , sitting at tollbooths or looking for parking spots . 
We need an integrated system that uses real time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers . 
And frankly , that 's the kind of system that 's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable . 
Now the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world . 
The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another , and they go underneath the city streets . 
And up above , you 've got a series of pedestrian walkways . 
On New York City 's 34th Street , gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle - specific corridors . 
Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created , and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in New York from about an hour today at rush hour to about 20 minutes . 
Now if you look at Hong Kong , they have a very interesting system called Octopus there . 
It 's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system . 
So parking garages , buses , trains , they all operate within the same system . 
Now shared car services are also springing up around the world , and these efforts , I think , are great . 
They 're relieving congestion , and they 're frankly starting to save some fuel . 
These are all really good ideas that will move us forward . 
But what really inspires me is what 's going to be possible when our cars can begin talking to each other . 
Very soon , the same systems that we use today to bring music and entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network . 
Every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn , Michigan . 
And every night I go home , my commute is a total crapshoot . 
And I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home . 
But very soon we 're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other . 
So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic , it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way . 
And these systems are being tested right now , and frankly they 're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon . 
But the potential of a connected car network is almost limitless . 
So just imagine : one day very soon , you 're going to be able to plan a trip downtown and your car will be connected to a smart parking system . 
So you get in your car , and as you get in your car , your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive -- no more driving around looking for one , which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today 's cars in urban areas -- is looking for parking spots . 
Or think about being in New York City and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone so you do n't have to wait in the cold to hail one . 
Or being at a future TED Conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time . 
This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system . 
So I think it 's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem . 
But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues , and also fossil fuels , there is no one silver bullet . 
The solution is not going to be more cars , more roads or a new rail system ; it can only be found , I believe , in a global network of interconnected solutions . 
Now I know we can develop the technology that 's going to make this work , but we 've got to be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions -- whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we have n't even thought of yet ; our overall transportation - mix and infrastructure must support all the future options . 
We need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue . 
Companies , entrepreneurs , venture capitalists , they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity , as well as an enormous social problem . 
And just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge -- and it 's really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power , how much money and how much serious thought has , really over the last three years , just poured into the green energy field . 
We need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock . 
But we need people like all of you in this room , leading thinkers . 
I mean , frankly , I need all of you to think about how you can help solve this huge issue . 
And we need people from all walks of life ; not just inventors , we need policymakers and government officials to also think about how they 're going to respond to this challenge . 
This is n't going to be solved by any one person or one group . 
It 's going to really require a national energy policy , frankly for each country , because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels , traffic jams and also how integrated the systems already are . 
But we need to get going , and we need to get going today . 
And we must have an infrastructure that 's designed to support this flexible future . 
You know , we 've come a long way . 
Since the Model T , most people never traveled more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime . 
And since then , the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live , where we work , where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around . 
We do n't want to regress and lose that freedom . 
We 're on our way to solving -- and as I said earlier , I know we 've got a long way to go -- the one big issue that we 're all focused on that threatens it , and that 's the environmental issue , but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock . 
Because in doing so , we 're going to preserve what we 've really come to take for granted , which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world . 
And it frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this . 
Because , if you can envision , as I do , a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today , that 's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow . 
I believe we 're at our best when we 're confronted with big issues . 
This is a big one , and it wo n't wait . 
So let 's get started now . 
Thank you .

Showing a series of inspiring , unusual and playful products , British branding and design guru Paul Bennett explains that design does n't have to be about grand gestures , but can solve small , universal and overlooked problems .

Paul Bennett finds design in the details 
Hello . Actually , that 's " hello " in Bauer Bodoni for the typographically hysterical amongst us . 
One of the threads that seems to have come through loud and clear in the last couple of days is this need to reconcile what the Big wants -- the " Big " being the organization , the system , the country -- and what the " Small " wants -- the individual , the person . 
And how do you bring those two things together ? 
Charlie Ledbetter , yesterday , I thought , talked very articulately about this need to bring consumers , to bring people into the process of creating things . 
And that 's what I want to talk about today . 
So , bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big , I think , is something that we believe in -- something I believe in , and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at Ideo . 
I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room -- the " Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious . " 
Often , the good ideas are so staring - at - you - right - in - the - face that you kind of miss them . And I think , a lot of times , what we do is just , sort of , hold the mirror up to our clients , and sort of go , " Duh ! You know , look what 's really going on . " 
And rather than talk about it in the theory , I think I 'm just going to show you an example . 
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota to describe to them what their patient experience was . 
And I think they were expecting -- they 'd worked with lots of consultants before -- I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart with thousands of bubbles and systemic this , that and the other , and all kinds of mappy stuff . 
Or even worse , some kind of ghastly death - by - Powerpoint thing with WowCharts and all kinds of , you know , God knows , whatever . 
The first thing we actually shared with them was this . 
I 'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve . 
This is 59 seconds into the film . 
This is a minute 59 . 
3:19 . 
I think something happens . I think a head may appear in a second . 
5:10 . 
5:58 . 
6:20 . 
We showed them the whole cut , and they were all completely , what is this ? 
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day , all you do is look at the roof , and it 's a really shitty experience . 
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient -- this is Christian , who works with us at Ideo . 
He just lay in the hospital bed , and , kind of , stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles for a really long time . 
That 's what it 's like to be a patient in the hospital . 
And they were sort , you know , blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious . 
Oh , my goodness . So , looking at the situation from the point of view of the person out -- as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in -- was , for these guys , quite a revelation . 
And so , that was a really catalytic thing for them . 
So they snapped into action . 
They said , OK , it 's not about systemic change . 
It 's not about huge , ridiculous things that we need to do . 
It 's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference . 
So we started with them prototyping some really little things that we could do to have a huge amount of impact . 
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror and we Band - Aided it here , onto a gurney , a hospital trolley , so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor , you could actually have a conversation with them . 
You could , kind of , see them in your rear - view mirror , so it created a tiny human interaction . 
Very small example of something that they could do . 
Interestingly , the nurses themselves , sort of , snapped into action -- said , OK , we embrace this . What can we do ? 
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling . 
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently . 
I think my mother now thinks that I 'm some sort of interior decorator . 
It 's what I do for a living , sort of Laurence Llewelyn - Bowen . 
Not particularly the world 's best design solution for those of us who are real , sort of , hard - core designers , but nonetheless , a fabulous empathic solution for people . 
Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient 's room so that it signified , " This is my room . This is my personal space " -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem . 
So you went from public space to private space . 
And another idea , again , that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional , sort of , corporate white boards , then they put them on one wall of the patient 's room , and they put this sticker there . 
So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room , which was lovely . 
So , tiny , tiny , tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact . 
I thought that was a really , really nice example . 
So this is not particularly a new idea , kind of , seeing opportunities in things that are around you and snapping and turning them into a solution . 
It 's a history of invention based around this . 
I 'm going to read this because I want to get these names right . 
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning , saw her daughter watching the test card , waiting for programs to come on one morning and from that came Sesame Street . 
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another and was wondering why it took these guys so long to get the boxes onto the ship . 
And he invented the shipping container . 
George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs , sort of little prickly things , and from that came Velcro . 
And finally , for the Brits , Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention -- saw the cat 's eyes at the side of the road , when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye . 
So there 's a whole series of just using your eyes , seeing things for the first time , seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities . 
Second one , without sounding overly Zen , and this is a quote from the Buddha : " Finding yourself in the margins , looking to the edges of things , is often a really interesting place to start . " 
Blinkered vision tends to produce , I think , blinkered solutions . 
So , looking wide , using your peripheral vision , is a really interesting place to look for opportunity . 
Again , another medical example here . 
We were asked by a device producer -- we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo . 
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo -- they 'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology for medical diagnostics . 
This was a device that a nurse uses when they 're doing a spinal procedure in hospital . 
They 'll ask the nurses to input data . 
And they had this vision of the nurse , kind of , clicking away on this aluminum device and it all being incredibly , sort of , gadget - lustish . 
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place -- and I 'll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really were n't recognizing . 
When you 're having a four - inch needle inserted into your spine -- which was the procedure that this device 's data was about ; it was for pain management -- you 're shit scared ; you 're freaking out . 
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did , was hold the patient 's hand to comfort them . Human gesture -- which made the fabulous two - handed data input completely impossible . 
So , the thing that we designed , much less sexy but much more human and practical , was this . 
So , it 's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination , but it has a thumb - scroll so you can do everything with one hand . 
So , again , going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture dictated the design of this product . 
And I think that 's really , really important . 
So , again , this idea of workarounds . 
We use this phrase " workarounds " a lot , sort of , looking around us . I was actually looking around the TED and just watching all of these kind of things happen while I 've been here . 
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life -- and the things we kind of do in our environment that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential -- is something that we look at a lot . 
We wrote a book recently , I think you might have received it , called " Thoughtless Acts ? " 
It 's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do , which have huge intention and huge opportunity . 
Why do we all follow the line in the street ? 
This is a picture in a Japanese subway . 
People consciously follow things even though , why , we do n't know . 
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence ? 
Because we kind of have to -- we 're just compelled to . 
We do n't know why , but we do . 
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle ? 
Again , we 're sort of using the world around us to create our own design solutions . 
And we 're always saying to our clients : " You should look at this stuff . 
This stuff is really important . This stuff is really vital . " 
This is people designing their own experiences . 
You can draw from this . 
We sort of assume that because there 's a pole in the street , that it 's okay to use it , so we park our shopping cart there . 
It 's there for our use , on some level . 
So , again , we sort of co - opt our environment to do all these different things . 
We co - opt other experiences -- we take one item and transfer it to another . 
And this is my favorite one . My mother used to say to me , " Just because your sister jumps in the lake does n't mean you have to . " 
But , of course , we all do . We all follow each other every day . 
So somebody assumes that because somebody else has done something , that 's permission for them to do the same thing . 
And there 's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time . 
I mean , shopping bag equals " parking meter out of order . " 
And we all , kind of , know how to read these signals now . 
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way without realizing what we 're doing . 
Third section is this idea of not knowing , of consciously putting yourself backwards . 
I talk about unthinking situations all the time . 
Sort of having beginner 's mind , scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh . 
A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA , and he was asked by his boss to help design a storage system for children . 
This is the Billy bookcase -- it 's IKEA 's biggest selling product . 
Hammer it together . Hammer it together with a shoe , if you 're me , because they 're impossible to assemble . 
But big selling bookcase . How do we replicate this for children ? 
The reality is when you actually watch children , children do n't think about things like storage in linear terms . 
Children assume permission in a very different way . 
Children live on things . They live under things . 
They live around things , and so their spatial awareness relationship , and their thinking around storage is totally different . 
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham , the designer -- is , sort of , put yourself in their shoes . And so , here he is sitting under the table . 
So , what came out of this ? 
This is the storage system that he designed . 
So what is this ? I hear you all ask . No , I do n't . 
It 's this , and I think this is a particularly lovely solution . 
So , you know , it 's a totally different way of looking at the situation . 
It 's a completely empathic solution -- apart from the fact that teddy 's probably not loving it . 
But a really nice way of re - framing the ordinary , and I think that 's one of the things . 
And putting yourself in the position of the person , and I think that 's one of the threads that I 've heard again from this conference is how do we put ourselves in other peoples ' shoes and really feel what they feel ? 
And then use that information to fuel solutions ? 
And I think that 's what this is very much about . 
Last section : green armband . We 've all got them . 
It 's about this really . 
I mean , it 's about picking battles big enough to matter but small enough to win . 
Again , that 's one of the themes that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference is : Where do we start ? How do we start ? What do we do to start ? 
So , again , we were asked to design a water pump for a company called ApproTEC , in Kenya . 
They 're now called KickStart . 
And , again , as designers , we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form . 
And that was completely irrelevant . 
When you put yourself in the position of these people , things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up and fit on a bicycle , become much more relevant than the form of it . The way it 's produced , it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods and indigenous materials . 
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user . 
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world . 
So what seems like a very clunky product is , in fact , incredibly useful . 
It 's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it . 
Children can use it . Adults can use it . Everybody uses it . 
It 's turning these guys -- again , one of the themes -- it 's turning them into entrepreneurs . 
These guys are using this very successfully . 
And for us , it 's been great because it 's won loads of design awards . 
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company , the needs of the individuals in the company , to feel good about a product we were actually designing , and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for . 
There it is , pumping water from 30 feet . 
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets to all of you this morning . 
We 've made a donation on everybody 's behalf here to kick start , no pun intended , their next project . 
Because , again , I think , sort of , putting our money where our mouth is , here . 
We feel that this is an important gesture . 
So we 've handed out bracelets . Small is the new big . 
I hope you 'll all wear them . 
So that 's it . Thank you .

Kiran Bir Sethi teaches kids to take charge 
Contagious is a good word . 
Even in the times of H1N1 , I like the word . 
Laughter is contagious . Passion is contagious . 
Inspiration is contagious . 
We 've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers . 
But for me , what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the " I Can " bug . 
So , the question is , why only them ? 
In a country of a billion people and some , why so few ? 
Is it luck ? Is it chance ? 
Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected ? 
So , in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story . 
I got infected when I was 17 , when , as a student of the design college , I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas , challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me . 
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt , and how contagious that feeling was . 
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven . 
So , when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab , a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the " I Can " bug . 
And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real - world context , that if you blur the boundaries between school and life , then children go through a journey of " aware , " where they can see the change , " enable , " be changed , and then " empower , " lead the change . 
And that directly increased student wellbeing . 
Children became more competent , and less helpless . 
But this was all common sense . 
So , I 'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside . 
A little background : when my grade five was learning about child rights , they were made to roll incense sticks , agarbattis , for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer . 
It transformed them . What you will see is their journey , and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world . 
That 's them rolling . 
And in two hours , after their backs were broke , they were changed . 
And once that happened , they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished . 
And look at Ragav , that moment when his face changes because he 's been able to understand that he has shifted that man 's mindset . 
And that ca n't happen in a classroom . 
So , when Ragav experienced that he went from " teacher told me , " to " I am doing it . " And that 's the " I Can " mindshift . 
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured . 
But we had parents who said , " Okay , making our children good human beings is all very well , but what about math and science and English ? 
Show us the grades . " 
And we did . The data was conclusive . 
When children are empowered , not only do they do good , they do well , in fact very well , as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in India , Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India in math , English and science . 
So , it worked . It was now time to take it outside Riverside . 
So , on August 15th , Independence Day , 2007 , the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad . 
Now it was not about Riverside school . 
It was about all children . So , we were shameless . 
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation , the police , the press , businesses , and basically said , " When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child ? 
When will you include the child in the city ? 
Basically , open your hearts and your minds to the child . " 
So , how did the city respond ? 
Since 2007 every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood . 
Here was a city telling its child , " You can . " 
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad . 
Video : [ Unclear ] So , the busiest streets closed down . 
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us . 
It gets taken over by children . 
They are skating . They are doing street plays . 
They are playing , all free , for all children . 
Atul Karwal : aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier . 
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city . 
Kiran Bir Sethi : And the city will give free time . 
And Ahmedabad got the first child - friendly zebra crossing in the world . 
Geet Sethi : When a city gives to the children , in the future the children will give back to the city . 
KBS : And because of that , Ahmedabad is known as India 's first child - friendly city . 
So , you 're getting the pattern . First 200 children at Riverside . 
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad , and growing . 
It was time now to infect India . 
So , on August 15th , again , Independence Day , 2009 , empowered with the same process , we empowered 100,000 children to say , " I can . " 
How ? We designed a simple toolkit , converted it into eight languages , and reached 32,000 schools . 
We basically gave children a very simple challenge . 
We said , take one idea , anything that bothers you , choose one week , and change a billion lives . 
And they did . Stories of change poured in from all over India , from Nagaland in the east , to Jhunjhunu in the west , from Sikkim in the north , to Krishnagiri in the south . 
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems . 
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism , and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages in Rajasthan . 
I mean , it was incredible . 
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say , " You can , " then they will . 
Infection in India . 
This is in Rajasthan , a rural village . 
Child : Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write . 
KBS : First time , a rally and a street play in a rural school -- unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important . 
Look at what their parents says . 
Man : This program is wonderful . 
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write . 
Woman : I am so happy that my students did this campaign . 
In the future , I will never doubt my students ' abilities . 
See ? They have done it . 
KBS : An inner city school in Hyderabad . 
Girl : 581 . This house is 581 ... 
We have to start collecting from 555 . 
KBS : Girls and boys in Hyderabad , going out , pretty difficult , but they did it . 
Woman : Even though they are so young , they have done such good work . 
First they have cleaned the society , then it will be Hyderabad , and soon India . 
Woman : It was a revelation for me . It does n't strike me that they had so much inside them . 
Girl : Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . 
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you , for a very good cause , the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids . 
Are you ready , ladies and gentlemen ? Audience : Yes ! 
Girl : Are you ready ? Audience : Yes ! 
Girl : Are you ready ? Audience : Yes ! 
KBS : So , the charter of compassion starts right here . 
Street plays , auctions , petitions . 
I mean , they were changing lives . 
It was incredible . 
So , how can we still stay immune ? 
How can we stay immune to that passion , that energy , that excitement ? 
I know it 's obvious , but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change , Gandhiji . 
70 years ago , it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of " We can . " 
So , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in India ? 
Last I heard , the preamble still said , " We , the people of India , " right ? 
So , if not us , then who ? 
If not now , then when ? 
Like I said , contagious is a good word . 
Thank you .

Architect Norman Foster discusses his own work to show how computers can help architects design buildings that are green , beautiful and " basically pollution - free . " From the 2007 DLD Conference , Munich ; www.dld-conference.com

Norman Foster 's green agenda 
As an architect you design for the present , with an awareness of the past , for a future which is essentially unknown . 
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda and issue of the day . 
And I 'd like to share some experience over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year -- and to explore and to touch on some observations about the nature of sustainability . 
How far you can anticipate , what follows from it , what are the threats , what are the possibilities , the challenges , the opportunities ? 
I think that -- I 've said in the past , many , many years ago , before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda , that it was n't about fashion -- it was about survival . 
But what I never said , and what I 'm really going to make the point is , that really , green is cool . 
I mean , all the projects which have , in some way , been inspired by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle , in a way celebrating the places and the spaces which determine the quality of life . 
I rarely actually quote anything , so I 'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can , [ in ] which somebody , at the end of last year , ventured the thought about what for that individual , as a kind of important observer , analyst , writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman , who wrote in the Herald Tribune , about 2006 . 
He said , " I think the most important thing to happen in 2006 was that living and thinking green hit Main Street . 
We reached a tipping point this year where living , acting , designing , investing and manufacturing green came to be understood by a critical mass of citizens , entrepreneurs and officials as the most patriotic , capitalistic , geo - political and competitive thing they could do . 
Hence my motto : green is the new red , white and blue . " 
And I asked myself , in a way , looking back , " When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear ? " 
And I think it was July 20 , 1969 , when , for the first time , man could look back at planet Earth . 
And , in a way , it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase . 
And before the kind of collapse of the communist system , I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts in Space City and other places in Russia . 
And interestingly , as I think back , they were the first true environmentalists . 
They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion , fired about the problems of the Aral Sea . 
And at that period it was -- in a way , a number of things were happening . 
Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru -- again , a word that had not been coined . 
He was a design scientist , if you like , a poet , but he foresaw all the things that are happening now . 
It 's another subject . It 's another conversation . 
You can go back to his writings : it 's quite extraordinary . 
It was at that time , with an awareness fired by Bucky 's prophecies , his concerns as a citizen , as a kind of citizen of the planet , that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time . 
And it 's a number of projects . 
I select this one because it was 1973 , and it was a master plan for one of the Canary Islands . 
And this probably coincided with the time when you had the planet Earth 's sourcebook , and you had the hippie movement . 
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing , which seeks to sum up the recommendations . 
And all the components are there which are now in common parlance , in our vocabulary , you know , 30-odd years later : wind energy , recycling , biomass , solar cells . 
And in parallel at that time , there was a very kind of exclusive design club . 
People who were really design conscious were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams , and the objects that he would create for the company called Braun . 
This is going back the mid-'50s , ' 60s . 
And despite Bucky 's prophecies that everything would be miniaturized and technology would make an incredible style -- access to comfort , to amenities -- it was very , very difficult to imagine that everything that we see in this image , would be very , very stylishly packaged . 
And that , and more besides , would be in the palm of your hand . 
And I think that that digital revolution now is coming to the point where , as the virtual world , which brings so many people together here , finally connects with the physical world , there is the reality that that has become humanized , so that digital world has all the friendliness , all the immediacy , the orientation of the analog world . 
Probably summed up in a way by the stylish or alternative available here , as we generously had gifted at lunchtime , the [ unclear ] , which is a further kind of development -- and again , inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel . 
A very , very beautiful object . 
So , something which in [ the ] ' 50s , ' 60s was very exclusive has now become , interestingly , quite inclusive . 
And the reference to the iPod as iconic , and in a way evocative of performance , delivery -- quite interesting that [ in ] the beginning of the year 2007 , the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained from the Prius as the hybrid , energy - conscious vehicle , which rivals the iPod as an iconic product . 
And I think it 's very tempting to , in a way , seduce ourselves -- as architects , or anybody involved with the design process -- that the answer to our problems lies with buildings . 
Buildings are important , but they 're only a component of a much bigger picture . 
In other words , as I might seek to demonstrate , if you could achieve the impossible , the equivalent of perpetual motion , you could design a carbon - free house , for example . 
That would be the answer . 
Unfortunately , it 's not the answer . 
It 's only the beginning of the problem . 
You can not separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit . 
For example , if , in that Bucky - inspired phrase , we draw back and we look at planet Earth , and we take a kind of typical , industrialized society , then the energy consumed would be split between the buildings , 44 percent , transport , 34 percent , and industry . 
But again , that only shows part of the picture . 
If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport , in other words , the transport of people , which is 26 percent , then 70 percent of the energy consumption is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together . 
So the problems of sustainability can not be separated from the nature of the cities , of which the buildings are a part . 
For example , if you take , and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city , what I 'll call , simplistically , a North American city -- and Detroit is not a bad example , it is very car dependent . 
The city goes out in annular rings , consuming more and more green space , and more and more roads , and more and more energy in the transport of people between the city center -- which again , the city center , as it becomes deprived of the living and just becomes commercial , again becomes dead . 
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example -- and Munich is not a bad example of that , with the greater dependence on walking and cycling -- then a city which is really only twice as dense , is only using one - tenth of the energy . 
In other words , you take these comparable examples and the energy leap is enormous . 
So basically , if you wanted to generalize , you can demonstrate that as the density increases along the bottom there , that the energy consumed reduces dramatically . 
Of course you ca n't separate this out from issues like social diversity , mass transit , the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance , the quality of civic spaces . 
But again , you can see Detroit , in yellow at the top , extraordinary consumption , down below Copenhagen . 
And Copenhagen , although it 's a dense city , is not dense compared with the really dense cities . 
In the year 2000 , a rather interesting thing happened . 
You had for the first time mega - cities , [ of ] 5 million or more , which were occurring in the developing world . 
And now , out of typically 46 cities , 33 of those mega - cities are in the developing world . 
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of , for example , China or India . 
If you take China , and you just take Beijing , you can see on that traffic system , and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles . 
In other words , if you put onto the roads , as is currently happening , 1,000 new cars every day -- statistically , it 's the biggest booming auto market in the world -- and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing . 
And that urbanization is extraordinary , accelerated pace . 
So , if we think of the transition in our society of the movement from the land to the cities , which took 200 years , then that same process is happening in 20 years . 
In other words , it is accelerating by a factor of 10 . 
And quite interestingly , over something like a 60-year period , we 're seeing the doubling in life expectancy , over that period where the urbanization has trebled . 
If I pull back from that global picture , and I look at the implication over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which , as a tool , is a tool for designers , and I cite our own experience as a company , and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology ? 
How does it affect the design of buildings ? 
And particularly , how can it lead to the creation of buildings which consume less energy , create less pollution and are more socially responsible ? 
That story , in terms of buildings , started in the late ' 60s , early ' 70s . 
The one example I take is a corporate headquarters for a company called Willis and Faber , in a small market town in the northeast of England , commuting distance with London . 
And here , the first thing you can see is that this building , the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket , a kind of insulating garden , which is also about the celebration of public space . 
In other words , for this community , they have this garden in the sky . 
So the humanistic ideal is very , very strong in all this work , encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here , where you can see greenery , you can see sunlight , you have a connection with nature . 
And nature is part of the generator , the driver for this building . 
And symbolically , the colors of the interior are green and yellow . 
It has facilities like swimming pools , it has flextime , it has a social heart , a space , you have contact with nature . 
Now this was 1973 . 
In 2001 , this building received an award . 
And the award was about a celebration for a building which had been in use over a long period of time . 
And the people who 'd created it came back : the project managers , the company chairmen then . 
And they were saying , you know , " The architects , Norman was always going on about designing for the future , and you know , it did n't seem to cost us any more . 
So we humored him , we kept him happy . " 
The image at the top , what it does n't -- if you look at it in detail , really what it is saying is you can wire this building . 
This building was wired for change . 
So , in 1975 , the image there is of typewriters . 
And when the photograph was taken , it 's word processors . 
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors had to build new buildings for the new technology . 
We were fortunate , because in a way our building was future - proofed . 
It anticipated change , even though those changes were not known . 
Round about that design period leading up to this building , I did a sketch , which we pulled out of the archive recently . 
And I was saying , and I wrote , " But we do n't have the time , and we really do n't have the immediate expertise at a technical level . " 
In other words , we did n't have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building . 
And that would be to create a kind of three - dimensional bubble -- a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate , would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads . 
Notwithstanding the fact that the building , as a green building , is very much a pioneering building . 
And if I fast - forward in time , what is interesting is that the technology is now available and celebratory . 
The library of the Free University , which opened last year , is an example of that . 
And again , the transition from one of the many thousands of sketches and computer images to the reality . 
And a combination of devices here , the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks , and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin , which enables the building to be ventilated , to consume dramatically less energy , and where it 's really working with the forces of nature . 
And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular by the people who use it . 
Again , coming back to that thing about the lifestyle , and in a way , the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit . 
So it 's not a kind of sacrifice , quite the reverse . 
I think it 's a great -- it 's a celebration . 
And you can measure the performance , in terms of energy consumption , of that building against a typical library . 
If I show another aspect of that technology then , in a completely different context -- this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland . 
Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials , but that material -- because of the technology , the computing ability , the ability to prefabricate , make high - performance components out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge . 
And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology , the ability to plot points in the sky and to transmit , to transfer that information now , directly into the factory . 
So if you cross the border -- just across the border -- a small factory in Germany , and here you can see the guy with his computer screen , and those points in space are communicated . 
And on the left are the cutting machines , which then , in the factory , enable those individual pieces to be fabricated and plus or minus very , very few millimeters , to be slotted together on site . 
And then interestingly , that building to then be clad in the oldest technology , which is the kind of hand - cut shingles . 
One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish . 
And again , the way in which that works as a building , for those of us who can enjoy the spaces , to live and visit there . 
If I made the leap into these new technologies , then how did we -- what happened before that ? 
I mean , you know , what was life like before the mobile phone , the things that you take for granted ? 
Well , obviously the building still happened . 
I mean , this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979 , which opened in 1985 , with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight deep into the heart of this space here . 
And in the absence of computers , you have to physically model . 
So for example , we would put models under an artificial sky . 
For wind tunnels , we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air , and the many kilometers of cable and so on . 
And the turning point was probably , in our terms , when we had the first computer . 
And that was at the time that we sought to redesign , reinvent the airport . 
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow , typical of any terminal -- big , heavy roof , blocking out the sunlight , lots of machinery , big pipes , whirring machinery . 
And Stansted , the green alternative , which uses natural light , is a friendly place : you know where you are , you can relate to the outside . 
And for a large part of its cycle , not needing electric light -- electric light , which in turn creates more heat , which creates more cooling loads and so on . 
And at that particular point in time , this was one of the few solitary computers . 
And that 's a little image of the tree of Stansted . 
Not going back very far in time , 1990 , that 's our office . 
And if you looked very closely , you 'd see that people were drawing with pencils , and they were pushing , you know , big rulers and triangles . 
It 's not that long ago , 17 years , and here we are now . 
I mean , major transformation . 
Going back in time , there was a lady called Valerie Larkin , and in 1987 , she had all our information on one disk . 
Now , every week , we have the equivalent of 84 million disks , which record our archival information on past , current and future projects . 
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky . 
This is the view you would get , if you looked down on that . 
But meanwhile , as you know , wonderful protagonists like Al Gore are noting the inexorable rise in temperature , set in the context of that , interestingly , those buildings which are celebratory and very , very relevant to this place . 
Our Reichstag project , which has a very familiar agenda , I 'm sure , as a public place where we sought to , in a way , through a process of advocacy , reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians , public space . And maybe its hidden agenda , an energy manifesto -- something that would be free , completely free of fuel as we know it . 
So it would be totally renewable . 
And again , the humanistic sketch , the translation into the public space , but this very , very much a part of the ecology . 
But here , not having to model it for real . 
Obviously the wind tunnel had a place , but the ability now with the computer to explore , to plan , to see how that would work in terms of the forces of nature : natural ventilation , to be able to model the chamber below , and to look at biomass . 
A combination of biomass , aquifers , burning vegetable oil -- a process that , quite interestingly , was developed in Eastern Germany , at the time of its dependence on the Soviet Bloc . 
So really , retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean , it was virtually pollution - free . 
You can measure it again . 
You can compare how that building , in terms of its emission in tons of carbon dioxide per year -- at the time that we took that project , over 7,000 tons -- what it would have been with natural gas and finally , with the vegetable oil , 450 tons . 
I mean , a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean . 
We can see the same processes at work in terms of the Commerce Bank -- its dependence on natural ventilation , the way that you can model those gardens , the way they spiral around . 
But again , very much about the lifestyle , the quality -- something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work . 
And again , we can measure the reduction in terms of energy consumption . 
There is an evolution here between the projects , and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further -- the project in the city in London . 
And this sequence shows the buildup of that model . 
But what it shows first , which I think is quite interesting , is that here you see the circle , you see the public space around it . 
What are the other ways of putting the same amount of space on the site ? 
If , for example , you seek to do a building which goes right to the edge of the pavement , it 's the same amount of space . 
And finally , you profile this , you cut grooves into it . 
The grooves become the kind of green lungs which give views , which give light , ventilation , make the building fresher . 
And you enclose that with something that also is central to its appearance , which is a mesh of triangulated structures -- again , in a long connection evocative of some of those works of Buckminster Fuller , and the way in which triangulation can increase performance and also give that building its sense of identity . 
And here , if we look at a detail of the way that the building opens up and breathes into those atria , the way in which now , with a computer , we can model the forces , we can see the high pressure , the low pressure , the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing . 
So it also has the ability , all the time , regardless of the direction of the wind , to be able to make the building fresh and efficient . 
And unlike conventional buildings , the top of the building is celebratory . 
It 's a viewing place for people , not machinery . 
And the base of the building is again about public space . 
Comparing it with a typical building , what happens if we seek to use such design strategies in terms of really large - scale thinking ? 
And I 'm just going to give two images out of a kind of company research project . 
It 's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying . 
The level is dropping , rather like the Aral Sea . 
And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower than the oceans and seas around it . 
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea by creating a pipeline , a pipe , sometimes above the surface , sometimes buried , that will redress that , and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba into the Dead Sea . 
And our translation of that , using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years , is to say , what if that , instead of being just a pipe , what if it is a lifeline ? 
What if it is the equivalent , depending on where you are , of the Grand Canal , in terms of tourists , habitation , desalination , agriculture ? 
In other words , water is the lifeblood . 
And if you just go back to the previous image , and you look at this area of volatility and hostility , that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together in a united cause , in terms of something that would be genuinely green and productive in the widest sense . 
Infrastructure at that large scale is also inseparable from communication . 
And whether that communication is the virtual world or it is the physical world , then it 's absolutely central to society . 
And how do we make more legible in this growing world , especially in some of the places that I 'm talking about -- China , for example , which in the next ten years will create 400 new airports . 
Now what form do they take ? 
How do you make them more friendly at that scale ? 
Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age , because you always have a point of reference . 
So what happens when we take that and you expand that further into the Chinese society ? 
And what is interesting is that that produces in a way perhaps the ultimate mega - building . 
It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment . 
250 -- excuse me , 50,000 people working 24 hours , seven days . 
Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new , un - built Terminal Five . 
And the challenge here is a building that will be green , that is compact despite its size and is about the human experience of travel , is about friendly , is coming back to that starting point , is very , very much about the lifestyle . 
And perhaps these , in the end , as celebratory spaces . 
As Hubert was talking over lunch , as we sort of engaged in conversation , talked about this , talked about cities . 
Hubert was saying , absolutely correctly , " These are the new cathedrals . " 
And in a way , one aspect of this conversation was triggered on New Year 's Eve , when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations . 
And I was voicing the thought that -- it just crossed my mind that New Year 's Eve , a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 -- that maybe , you know , the future was the most powerful , innovative sort of nation . 
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say , " We put a man on the moon . " 
You know , who is going to say that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels , with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes , and so on . 
And that 's a concerted platform . 
It 's more than one device , you know , it 's renewable . 
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year , I thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other , larger countries out there -- the Chinas , the Indias , the Asian - Pacific tigers . 
Thank you very much .

Anil Gupta : India 's hidden hotbeds of invention 
I bring to you a message from tens of thousands of people -- in the villages , in the slums , in the hinterland of the country -- who have solved problems through their own genius , without any outside help . 
When our home minister announces a few weeks ago a war on one third of India , about 200 districts that he mentioned were ungovernable , he missed the point . 
The point that we have been stressing for the last 21 years , the point that people may be economically poor , but they 're not poor in the mind . 
In other words , the minds on the margin are not the marginal minds . 
That is the message , which we started 31 years ago . 
And what did it start ? 
Let me just tell you , briefly , my personal journey , which led me to come to this point . 
In ' 85 , ' 86 , I was in Bangladesh advising the government and the research council there how to help scientists work on the lands , on the fields of the poor people , and how to develop research technologies , which are based on the knowledge of the people . 
I came back in ' 86 . 
I had been tremendously invigorated by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country , which had 60 percent landlessness but amazing creativity . 
I started looking at my own work : The work that I had done for the previous 10 years , almost every time , had instances of knowledge that people had shared . 
Now , I was paid in dollars as a consultant , and I looked at my income tax return and tried to ask myself : " Is there a line in my return , which shows how much of this income has gone to the people whose knowledge has made it possible ? 
Was it because I 'm brilliant that I 'm getting this reward , or because of the revolution ? 
Is it that I write very well ? 
Is it that I articulate very well ? 
Is it that I analyze the data very well ? 
Is it because I 'm a professor , and , therefore , I must be entitled to this reward from society ? " 
I tried to convince myself that , " No , no , I have worked for the policy changes . 
You know , the public policy will become more responsive to the needs of the poor , and , therefore I think it 's okay . " 
But it appeared to me that all these years that I 'd been working on exploitation -- exploitation by landlords , by moneylenders , by traders -- gave me an insight that probably I was also an exploiter , because there was no line in my income tax return which showed this income accrued because of the brilliance of the people -- those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me -- and nothing ever went back to them . 
So much so , that much of my work till that time was in the English language . 
The majority of the people from whom I learned did n't know English . 
So what kind of a contributor was I ? 
I was talking about social justice , and here I was , a professional who was pursuing the most unjust act -- of taking knowledge from the people , making them anonymous , getting rent from that knowledge by sharing it and doing consultancy , writing papers and publishing them in the papers , getting invited to the conferences , getting consultancies and whatever have you . 
So then , a dilemma rose in the mind that , if I 'm also an exploiter , then this is not right ; life can not go on like that . 
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma because I could n't live with it any longer . 
So I did a review of ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research , wrote , read about 100 papers . 
And I came to the conclusion that while dilemma is unique , dilemma is not unique ; the solution had to be unique . 
And one day -- I do n't know what happened -- while coming back from the office towards home , maybe I saw a honey bee or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee , life would be wonderful . 
What the honey bee does : it pollinates , takes nectar from the flower , pollinates another flower , cross - pollinates . 
And when it takes the nectar , the flowers do n't feel shortchanged . 
In fact , they invite the honey bees through their colors , and the bees do n't keep all the honey for themselves . 
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network : that whenever we learn something from people it must be shared with them in their language . 
They must not remain anonymous . 
And I must tell you that after 20 years , I have not made one percent of change in the professional practice of this art . 
That is a great tragedy -- which I 'm carrying still with me and I hope that all of you will carry this with you -- that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous . 
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences or Research Councils of the U.K. 
or of Indian Councils of Science Research do not require that whatever you learn from people , you must share back with them . 
We are talking about an accountable society , a society that is fair and just , and we do n't even do justice in the knowledge market . 
And India wants to be a knowledge society . 
How will it be a knowledge society ? 
So , obviously , you can not have two principles of justice , one for yourself and one for others . 
It must be the same . 
You can not discriminate . 
You can not be in favor of your own values , which are at a distance from the values that you espouse . 
So , fairness to one and to the other is not divisible . 
Look at this picture . 
Can you tell me where has it been taken from , and what is it meant for ? Anybody ? 
I 'm a professor ; I must quiz you . 
Anybody ? Any guess at all ? 
Pardon ? 
Anil Gupta : But what has it been used for ? What has it been used for ? 
Pardon ? 
You know , you 're so right . We must give him a hand , because this man knows how insensitive our government is . 
Look at this . This is the site of the government of India . 
It invites tourists to see the shame of our country . 
I 'm so sorry to say that . 
Is this a beautiful picture or is it a terrible picture ? 
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people . 
If this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles , you can not be celebrating that . 
We should be doing something about it . 
And let me tell you , with all the science and technology at our command , millions of women still carry water on their heads . 
And we do not ask this question . 
You must have taken tea in the morning . 
Think for a minute . 
The leaves of the tea , plucked from the bushes ; you know what the action is ? The action is : The lady picks up a few leaves , puts them in the basket on the backside . 
Just do it 10 times ; you will realize the pain in this shoulder . 
And she does it a few thousand times every day . 
The rice that you ate in the lunch , and you will eat today , is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture , millions of them , every season , in the paddy season , when they transplant paddy with their feet in the water . 
And feet in the water will develop fungus , infections , and that infection pains because then other insects bite that point . 
And every year , 99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually . 
No machines have been developed . 
So the silence of scientists , of technologists , of public policy makers , of the change agent , drew our attention that this is not on , this is not on ; this is not the way society will work . 
This is not what our parliament would do . You know , we have a program for employment : One hundred , 250 million people have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country . 
Doing what ? Breaking stones , digging earth . 
So we asked a question to the parliament : Do poor have heads ? 
Do poor have legs , mouth and hands , but no head ? 
So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich . 
And what has happened ? 
An anonymous , faceless , nameless person gets in contact with the network , and then gets an identity . 
This is what Honey Bee Network is about . 
And this network grew voluntarily , continues to be voluntary , and has tried to map the minds of millions of people of our country and other parts of the world who are creative . 
They could be creative in terms of education , they may be creative in terms of culture , they may be creative in terms of institutions ; but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity , the innovations , either in terms of contemporary innovations , or in terms of traditional knowledge . 
And it all begins with curiosity . 
It all begins with curiosity . 
This person , whom we met -- and you will see it on the website , www.sristi.org -- this tribal person , he had a wish . 
And he said , " If my wish gets fulfilled " -- somebody was sick and he had to monitor -- " God , please cure him . 
And if you cure him , I will get my wall painted . " 
And this is what he got painted . 
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy . 
There could be nothing more wrong than the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment . 
Kabir , Rahim , all the great Sufi saints , they were all poor people , and they had a great reason . 
Please do not ever think that only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment . 
Any person anywhere is capable of rising to that highest point of attainment , only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something . 
Look at this . 
We saw it in Shodh Yatra . Every six months we walk in different parts of the country . 
I 've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years . 
So on the wayside we found these dung cakes , which are used as a fuel . 
Now , this lady , on the wall of the dung cake heap , has made a painting . 
That 's the only space she could express her creativity . 
And she 's so marvelous . 
Look at this lady , Ram Timari Devi , on a grain bin . In Champaran , we had a Shodh Yatra and we were walking in the land where Gandhiji went to hear about the tragedy , pain of indigo growers . 
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura . 
Look at what she has done . 
The whole wall is her canvas . She 's sitting there with a broom . 
Is she an artisan or an artist ? 
Obviously she 's an artist ; she 's a creative person . 
If we can create markets for these artists , we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones . 
They will be paid for what they are good at , not what they 're bad at . 
Look at what Rojadeen has done . 
In Motihari in Champaran , there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack and , obviously , there 's a limited market for tea . 
Every morning you have tea , as well as coffee . 
So he thought , why do n't I convert a pressure cooker into a coffee machine ? 
So this is a coffee machine . Just takes a few hundred rupees . 
People bring their own cooker , he attaches a valve and a steam pipe , and now he gives you espresso coffee . 
Now , this is a real , affordable coffee percolator that works on gas . 
Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done . 
A lot of poor people do not have enough grains to get ground . 
So this fellow is bringing a flour - grinding machine on a two - wheeler . 
If you have 500 grams , 1000 , one kilogram , he will grind it for it for you ; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity . 
Please understand the problem of poor people . 
They have needs which have to be met efficiently in terms of energy , in terms of cost , in terms of quality . 
They do n't want second - standard , second - quality outputs . 
But to be able to give them high - quality output you need to adapt technology to their needs . 
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did . 
But that 's not enough , what he did . Look at what he did here . 
If you have clothes , and you do n't have enough time to wash them , he brought a washing machine to your doorstep , mounted on a two - wheeler . 
So here 's a model where a two - wheeler washing machine ... 
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep . 
You bring your water , you bring your soap , I wash the clothes for you . Charge 50 paisa , one rupee for you per lot , and a new business model can emerge . 
Now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up . 
Look at this . 
It looks like a beautiful photograph . 
But you know what it is ? Can anybody guess what it is ? 
Somebody from India would know , of course . 
It 's a tawa . 
It 's a hot plate made of clay . 
Now , what is the beauty in it ? 
When you have a non - stick pan , it costs about , maybe , 250 rupees , five dollars , six dollars . 
This is less than a dollar and this is non - stick ; it is coated with one of these food - grade materials . 
And the best part is that , while you use a costly non - stick pan , you eat the so - called Teflon or Teflon - like material because after some time the stuff disappears . Where has it gone ? 
It has gone in your stomach . It was not meant for that . 
You know ? But here in this clay hot plate , it will never go into your stomach . 
So it is better , it is safer ; it is affordable , it is energy - efficient . 
In other words , solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper , need not be , so - called , jugaad , need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement . 
They have to be better , they have to be more efficient , they have to be affordable . 
And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done . 
He has designed this plate with a handle . 
And now with one dollar , you can afford a better alternative than the people market is offering you . 
This lady , she developed a herbal pesticide formulation . 
We filed the patent for her , the National Innovation Foundation . 
And who knows ? Somebody will license this technology and develop marketable products , and she would get revenue . 
Now , let me mention one thing : I think we need a polycentric model of development , where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country , in different parts of the world , would solve the needs of locality in a very efficient and adaptive manner . 
Higher the local fit , greater is the chance of scaling up . 
In the scaling up , there 's an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people , point by point , with the supply that you 're making . 
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch ? 
Things can scale up , and they have scaled up . 
For example , cell phones : We have 400 million cellphones in this country . 
Now , it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone , only three options on the cellphone . 
It has 300 options , I 'm paying for 300 ; I 'm using only three but I 'm willing to live with it , therefore it is scaling up . 
But if I had to get a match to match , obviously , I would need a different design of a cellphone . 
So what we 're saying is that scalability should not become an enemy of sustainability . 
There must be a place in the world for solutions that are only relevant for a locality , and yet , one can be able to fund them . 
One of the greatest studies that we 've been finding is that many times investors would ask this question -- " What is a scalable model ? " -- as if the need of a community , which is only located in a space and time and has those needs only located in those places , has no legitimate right to get them for free because it 's not part of a larger scale . 
So either you sub - optimize your needs to a larger scale or else you remain out . 
Now , the eminent model , the long - tail model tells you that small sales of a large number of books , for example , having only a few copies sold can still be a viable model . 
And we must find a mechanism where people will pool in the portfolio , will invest in the portfolio , where different innovations will go to a small number of people in their localities , and yet , the overall platform of the model will become viable . 
Look at what he is doing . 
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man . 
At the age of 70 , he is linking up something very creative . 
Saidullah Sahib : I could n't wait for the boat . 
I had to meet my love . 
My desperation made me an innovator . 
Even love needs help from technology . 
Innovation is the light of my wife , Noor . 
New inventions are the passion of my life . 
My technology . 
AG : Saidulluh Sahib is in Motihari , again in Champaran . 
Wonderful human being , but he stills sells , at this age , honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood , because we have n't been able to convince the water park people , the lake people , in [ unclear ] operations . 
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago and people had to walk 20 kilometers , wading in the water -- that , look , you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office because you can then go to those lanes where your buses will not go , where your transport will not go . 
So we have not yet cracked the problem of making it available as a rescue device , as a vending device during the floods in eastern India , when you have to deliver things to people in different islands where they 're marooned . 
But the idea has a merit . The idea has a merit . 
What has Appachan done ? Appachan , unfortunately , is no more , but he has left behind a message . 
A very powerful message Appachan : I watch the world wake up every day . 
It 's not that a coconut fell on my head , and I came upon this idea . 
With no money to fund my studies , I scaled new heights . 
Now , they call me the local Spiderman . 
My technology . 
AG : Many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internationally -- what I call a G2 G model , grassroots to global . 
And a professor in the University of Massachusetts , in the zoology department , bought this climber because she wanted to study the insect diversity of the top of the tree canopy . 
And this device makes it possible for her to take samples from a larger number of palms , rather than only a few , because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her [ unclear ] would climb on that . 
So , you know , we are advancing the frontiers of science . 
Remya Jose has developed ... 
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates and then you will find these videos . 
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th : a washing machine - cum - exercising machine . 
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person , one and a half foot height , only . 
But he has modified a two - wheeler so that he can get autonomy and freedom and flexibility . 
This innovation is from the slums of Rio . 
And this person , Mr. Ubirajara . 
We were talking about , my friends in Brazil , how we scale up this model in China and Brazil . 
And we have a very vibrant network in China , particularly , but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world . 
This stand on the front wheel , you will not find on any cycle . 
India and China have the largest number of cycles . 
But this innovation emerged in Brazil . 
The point is , none of us should be parochial , none of us should be so nationalistic to believe that all good ideas will come only from our country . 
No , we have to have the humility to learn from knowledge of economically poor people , wherever they are . 
And look at this whole range of cycle - based innovations : cycle that 's a sprayer , cycle that generates energy from the shocks on the road . 
I ca n't change the condition of the road , but I can make the cycle run faster . 
That is what Kanak Das has done . 
And in South Africa , we had taken our innovators , and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa as to how innovation can become a means of liberation from the drudgery that people have . 
And this is a donkey cart which they modified . 
There 's an axle here , of 30 , 40 kg , serving no purpose . 
Remove it , the cart needs one donkey less . 
This is in China . This girl needed a breathing apparatus . 
These three people in the village sat down and decided to think , " How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village ? " 
They were not related to her , but they tried to find out , " How can we use ... " They used a cycle , they put together a breathing apparatus . 
And this breathing apparatus now saved the life , and she 's very welcome . 
There 's a whole range of innovations that we have . 
A car , which runs on compressed air with six paisa per kilometer . 
Assam , Kanak Gogoi . 
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe , but this is available in India . 
Now , this lady , she used to do the winding of the yarn for Pochampally Saree . 
In one day , 18,000 times , she had to do this winding to generate two sarees . 
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle . 
She said , " Change your profession . " 
He said , " I ca n't . This is the only thing I know , but I 'll invent a machine , which will solve your problem . " 
And this is what he did , a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh . 
So , this is what SRISTI is saying : " Give me a place to stand , and I will move the world . " 
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children for creativity , a whole range of things . 
We have sold things all over the world , from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever . 
Products have gone to the market , a few . 
These are the people whose knowledge made this Herbavate cream for eczema possible . 
And here , a company which licensed this herbal pesticide put a photograph of the innovator on the packing so that every time a user uses it , it asks the user , " You can also be an innovator . 
If you have an idea , send it back to us . " 
So , creativity counts , knowledge matters , innovations transform , incentives inspire . 
And incentives : not just material , but also non - material incentives . 
Thank you .

Lighting architect Rogier van der Heide offers a beautiful new way to look at the world -- by paying attention to light . Examples from classic buildings illustrate a deeply thought - out vision of the play of light around us . 
architecture , design 
1098 
Rogier van der Heide : Why light needs darkness 
There 's a beautiful statement on the screen that says , " Light creates ambiance , light makes the feel of a space , and light is also the expression of structure . " 
Well that was not by me . 
That was , of course , by Le Corbusier , the famous architect . 
And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings -- the chapel Notre Dame du Haut , Ronchamp -- where he creates this light that he could only make because there 's also dark . 
And I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well - being without proper darkness . 
So this is how we normally would light our offices . 
We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much lux and of great uniformity . 
This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other in a regular grid of lamps . 
And that is quite different from what I just showed you from Le Corbusier . 
If we would apply these codes and standards to the Pantheon in Rome , it would never have looked like this , because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building . 
And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said when he said , " Light : I make it in my buildings for comfort . " 
And he did n't mean the comfort of a five - course dinner as opposed to a one - course meal , but he really meant the comfort of the quality of the building for the people . 
He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun . 
And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky , and where you can experience the sun , that give us a better life in the built environment , just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows . 
What it all boils down to is , of course , the sun . 
And this image of the sun may suggest that the sun is something evil and aggressive , but we should not forget that all energy on this planet actually comes from the sun , and light is only a manifestation of that energy . 
The sun is for dynamics , for color changes . 
The sun is for beauty in our environment , like in this building -- the High Museum in Atlanta , which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy , together with Arup Lighting , a brilliant team of lighting designers , who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space , responding to what the sun does outside , just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof . 
So in an indirect way , you can see the sun . 
And what they did is they created an integral building element to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum . 
They created this shade that you can see here , which actually covers the sun , but opens up to the good light from the sky . 
And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process with physical models , with quantitative , as well as qualitative , methods to come to a final solution that is truly integrated and completely holistic with the architecture . 
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way . 
As you can see here , there 's some direct light on the floor , but they could easily figure out where that comes from . 
And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun , the good part of the sun . 
And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways , of course . 
It can be just like this , or maybe like this , which is rather peculiar , but this is in 1963 -- the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States . 
And it 's just a bit bright up there , so these people have found a very intriguing solution . 
This is , I think , a very illustrative image of what I try to say -- that the beautiful dynamics of sun , bringing these into the building , creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives . 
And this is all about darkness as much as it is about lightness , of course , because otherwise you do n't see these dynamics . 
As opposed to the first office that I showed you in the beginning of the talk , this is a well - known office , which is the White Group . 
They are in green energy consulting , or something like that . 
And they really practice what they preach because this office does n't have any electric lighting at all . 
It has only on one side this big , big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range . 
So it can be very dim over there , and you do your work , and it can be very bright over there , and you do your work . 
But actually the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable to all these different light conditions that together create an environment that is never boring and that is never dull , and therefore helps us to enhance our lives . 
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you . 
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago , which is the reason I bring him up now , because it 's kind of an anniversary year . 
In the 1930s , Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe a methodology of modern lighting design . 
And he coined three terms , which are " focal glow , " " ambient luminescence " and " play of the brilliants " -- three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture that all together make up this beautiful experience . 
So you begin with focal glow . 
He meant something like this -- where the light gives direction to the space and helps you to get around . 
Or something like this , which is the lighting design he did for General Motors , for the car showroom . 
And you enter that space , and you feel like , " Wow ! This is so impressive , " just because of this focal point , this huge light source in the middle . 
To me it is something from theatre , and I will get back to that a little bit later . 
It 's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus . 
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land , highlighting it compared to the dim environment . 
Or it can be in today 's retail , in the shopping environment -- lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around . 
Ambient luminescence is something very different . 
Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite , something without any focus , something where all details actually dissolve in infinity . 
And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate . 
It could also be something like this : the National Museum of Science in London , where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries in one large gesture . 
And then finally , Kelly 's play of brilliants attitude , that really some play of the skyline of Hong Kong , or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house , or in the theater here , which is a decoration , the icing on the cake , something playful , something that is just an addition to the architectural environment , I would say . 
These three distinct elements , together , make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better . 
And we can only create these out of darkness . 
And I will explain that further . 
And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly , here on the left , was explaining to Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe . 
And behind them , you see that Seagram Building that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design . 
Those times , there were some early attempts also for light therapy already . 
You can see here a photo from the United States Library of Medicine , where people are put in the sun to get better . 
It 's a little bit of a different story , this health aspect of light , than what I 'm telling you today . 
In today 's modern medicine , there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way . 
And there is the idea that , when we look at things , it is the yellow light that helps us the most , that we are the most sensitive for . 
But our circadian rhythms , which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on , they are much more triggered by blue light . 
And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment , we can help people to relax , or to be alert , to fall asleep , or to stay awake . 
And that is how , maybe in the near future , light can help hospitals to make people better sooner , recover them quicker . 
Maybe in the airplane , we can overcome jet lag like that . 
Perhaps in school , we can help children to learn better because they concentrate more on their work . 
And you can imagine a lot more applications . 
But I would like to talk further about the combination of light and darkness as a quality in our life . 
So light is , of course , for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the features around us . 
It is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other . 
And it is all about this planet . 
But when you look at this planet at night , it looks like this . 
And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today . 
Because all this light here goes up to the sky . 
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for . 
It never is to the benefit of people . 
It only spoils the darkness . 
So at a global scale , it looks like this . 
And , I mean , that is quite amazing , what you see here -- how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground . 
Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be , it would be something like this very inspiring image where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation and to help us to relate to everything . 
The world is changing though , and urbanization is a big driver of everything . 
I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou , and I realized that 10 years ago , there was nothing like this , of these buildings . 
It was just a much smaller city , and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous . 
And we have to understand these main questions : How do people move through these new urban spaces ? 
How do they share their culture ? 
How do we tackle things like mobility ? 
And how can light help there ? 
Because the new technologies , they seem to be in a really interesting position to contribute to the solutions of urbanization and to provide us with better environments . 
It 's not that long ago that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps . 
And of course , we had the metal halide lamps and fluorescent lamps and things like that . 
Now we have LED , but here you see the latest one , and you see how incredibly small it is . 
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity because this tiny , tiny size allows us to put the light wherever we really need it . 
And we can actually leave it out where it 's not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness . 
So that is a really interesting proposition , I think , and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well - being in mind . 
The problem is though that I wanted to explain to you how this really works -- but I can have four of these on my finger , so you would not to be able to really see them . 
So I asked our laboratory to do something about it , and they said , " Well , we can do something . " 
They created for me the biggest LED in the world especially for TEDx in Amsterdam . 
So here it is . 
It 's the same thing as you can see over there -- just 200 times bigger . 
And I will very quickly show you how it works . 
So just to explain . 
Now , every LED that is made these days gives blue light . 
Now this is not very pleasant and comfortable . 
And for that reason , we cover the LED with a phosphor cap . 
And the phosphor is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleasant . 
And then when you add the lens to that , you can bundle the light and send it to wherever you need it without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else . 
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light . 
I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works . 
Thank you . 
We can go further . 
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities . 
We have to think again about light as a default solution . 
Why are all these motorways permanently lit ? 
Is it really needed ? 
Can we maybe be much more selective and create better environments that also benefit from darkness ? 
Can we be more gentle with light ? 
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually . 
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create , so they really want to connect with it , like here ? 
Or can we create simply sculptures that are very inspiring to be in and to be around ? 
And can we preserve the darkness ? 
Because to find a place like this today on Earth is really very , very challenging . 
And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult . 
Even in the oceans , we are creating a lot of light that we could actually ban also for animal life to have a much greater well - being . 
And it 's known that migrating birds , for example , get very disoriented because of these offshore platforms . 
And we discovered that , when we make those lights green , the birds , they actually go the right way . 
They are not disturbed anymore . 
And it turns out once again that spectral sensitivity is very important here . 
In all of these examples , I think , we should start making the light out of darkness , and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do , like Edward Hopper in this painting . 
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting . 
I think , when I see it , I start to think , who are those people ? 
Where have they come from ? Where are they going ? 
What just happened ? What will be happening in the next five minutes ? 
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense because of the darkness and the light . 
Edward Hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark . 
And we can learn from that and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments . 
We can do that in commercial spaces like this . 
And you can still also go outside and enjoy the greatest show in the universe , which is , of course , the universe itself . 
So I give you this wonderful , informative image of the sky , ranging from the inner city , where you may see one or two stars and nothing else , all the way to the rural environments , where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance of the constellations and the stars . 
In architecture , it works just the same . 
By appreciating the darkness when you design the light , you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives . 
This is the most well - known example , Tadao Ando 's Church of Light . 
But I also think of Peter Zumthor 's spa in Vals , where light and dark , in very gentle combinations , alter each other to define the space . 
Or Richard McCormack 's Southern tube station in London , where you can really see the sky , even though you are under the ground . 
And finally I want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater . 
And I think it 's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx in a theater for the first time because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks . 
It would n't be such an inspiring scenography without this theater . 
And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light . 
Thank you very much .

Dean Kamen on inventing and giving 
As you pointed out , every time you come here , you learn something . 
This morning , the world 's experts from I guess three or four different companies on building seats , I think concluded that ultimately , the solution is , people should n't sit down . 
I could have told them that . 
Yesterday , the automotive guys gave us some new insights . 
They pointed out that , I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today , they will be steering cars by wire , without all that mechanical stuff . 
That 's reassuring . 
They then pointed out that there 'd be , sort of , the other controls by wire , to get rid of all that mechanical stuff . 
That 's pretty good , but why not get rid of the wires ? 
Then you do n't need anything to control the car , except thinking about it . 
I would love to talk about the technology , and sometime , in what 's past the 15 minutes , I 'll be happy to talk to all the techno - geeks around here about what 's in here . 
But if I had one thing to say about this , before we get to first , it would be that from the time we started building this , the big idea was n't the technology . 
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the iBOT for the disabled community . 
The big idea here is , I think , a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation . 
And maybe to put that in perspective : there 's so much data on this , I 'll be happy to give it to you in different forms . 
You never know what strikes the fancy of whom , but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world . 
And Henry Ford , just about 100 years ago , started cranking out Model Ts . 
What I do n't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied . 
For instance , in that time , 91 percent of America lived either on farms or in small towns . 
So , the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal ; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage . 
It was half as long . 
And it was an environmental improvement , because , for instance , in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan , because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses , and a million of them urinating and doing other things , and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable . 
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy . 
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm , or their farm to a town , or from a town to a city . 
It all made sense , with 91 percent of the people living there . 
By the 1950s , we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world , the highway system . 
And it is certainly a wonder . 
And by the way , as I take shots at old technologies , I want to assure everybody , and particularly the automotive industry -- who 's been very supportive of us -- that I do n't think this in any way competes with airplanes , or cars . 
But think about where the world is today . 
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities . 
That 's 3.2 billion people . 
We 've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today . 
500 years ago , sailing ships started getting reliable enough ; we found a new continent . 
150 years ago , locomotives got efficient enough , steam power , that we turned the continent into a country . 
Over the last hundred years , we started building cars , and then over the 50 years we 've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way , and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that . 
But during that entire process , more and more people have been born , and more and more people are moving to cities . 
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half . 
And so , nobody , I think , would argue that airplanes , in the last 50 years , have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood . 
And if you just look at how technology has been applied , we 've solved all the long - range , high - speed , high - volume , large - weight problems of moving things around . 
Nobody would want to give them up . 
And I certainly would n't want to give up my airplane , or my helicopter , or my Humvee , or my Porsche . 
I love them all . I do n't keep any of them in my living room . 
The fact is , the last mile is the problem , and half the world now lives in dense cities . 
And people spend , depending on who they are , between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot . 
I think there 's -- I do n't know what data would impress you , but how about , 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States . 
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air , and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices , particularly sitting in cities . 
And again , I say that not to attack any industry , I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane , and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient , both from an engineering point of view , an energy consumption point of view , and a utility point of view . 
And we all love our cars , and I do . 
The problem is , you get into the city and you want to go four blocks , it 's neither fun nor efficient nor productive . 
It 's not sustainable . 
If -- in China , in the year 1998 , 417 million people used bicycles ; 1.7 million people used cars . 
If five percent of that population became , quote , middle class , and wanted to go the way we 've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of Manhattan , every six weeks -- it is n't sustainable environmentally ; it is n't sustainable economically -- there just ai n't enough oil -- and it 's not sustainable politically . 
I mean , what are we fighting over right now ? 
We can make it complicated , but what 's the world fighting over right now ? 
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile , and it was dumb luck . We were working on iBOTs , but once we made this , we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis . You do n't need the water . 
Or snowmobiles . You do n't need the snow . 
Or skiing . It 's just fun , and people love to move around doing fun things . 
And every one of those industries , by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi - billion - dollar industry . 
But rather than go license this off , which is what we normally do , it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology , but into an understanding of a world that 's solved all its other problems , but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which , right back from ancient Greece on , were meant to walk around , cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that , while we 've solved every other transportation problem -- and it 's like Moore 's law . 
I mean , look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon , then on a railroad , then an airplane . 
Every other form of transportation 's been improved . 
In 5,000 years , we 've gone backwards in getting around cities . 
They 've gotten bigger ; they 're spread out . 
The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- Wilshire Boulevard , or Fifth Avenue , or Tokyo , or Paris -- the most expensive real estate is their downtowns . 
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars . 
The 20 largest cities in the world . 
So you wonder , what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities ? 
What if you could make them fun , attractive , clean , environmentally friendly ? 
What if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this , as that last link to mass transit , to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want , and then have our cities energized again ? 
We thought it would be really neat to do that , and one of the problems we really were worried about is : how do we get legal on the sidewalk ? 
Because technically I 've got motors ; I 've got wheels -- I 'm a motor vehicle . 
I do n't look like a motor vehicle . 
I have the same footprint as a pedestrian ; I have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space . 
I took this down to Ground Zero , and knocked my way through crowds for an hour . 
I 'm a pedestrian . But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two , and if we get told we do n't belong on the sidewalk , we have two choices . 
We 're a recreational vehicle that does n't really matter , and I do n't spend my time doing that kind of stuff . 
Or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle . 
We 've been so concerned about that , we went to the Postmaster General of the United States , as the first person we ever showed on the outside , and said , " Put your people on it . Everybody trusts their postman . 
And they belong on the sidewalks , and they 'll use it seriously . " 
He agreed . We went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat , carrying 70 pounds of stuff . They love it . 
And I ca n't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket . 
So we 've been working really , really hard , but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what 's important , and how to apply the technology . 
We went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things , and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted . 
So , I 'm happy , really , I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want . 
And yes , it 's really fun , and yes , you should all go out and try it . 
But if I could ask you to do one thing , it 's not to think about it as a piece of technology , but just imagine that , although we all understand somehow that it 's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine , which can go 60 miles an hour , that can bring you everywhere you want to go , and somehow it 's also what we used for the last mile , and it 's broken , and it does n't work . 
One of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted , happened out here in California . 
A few weeks ago , after we launched it , we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach , zipping up and back , and he 's marveling at the technology , and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by , and skateboarders are zipping by , and a little old lady -- I mean , if you looked in the dictionary , a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that I 'm on this , I 'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops , and the camera is there , and she looks up at me and says , " Can I try that ? " 
And what was I -- you know , how are you going to say anything ? 
And so I said , " Sure . " 
So I get off , and she gets on , and with a little bit of the usual , ah , then she turns around , and she goes about 20 feet , and she turns back around , and she 's all smiles . 
And she comes back to me and she stops , and she says , " Finally , they made something for us . " 
And the camera is looking down at her . 
I 'm thinking , " Wow , that was great -- -- please lady , do n't say another word . " 
And the camera is down at her , and this guy has to put the microphone in her face , said , " What do you mean by that ? " 
And I figured , " It 's all over now , " and she looks up and she says , " Well , " she 's still watching these guys go ; she says , " I ca n't ride a bike , " no , she says , " I ca n't use a skateboard , and I 've never used roller blades , " she knew them by name ; she says , " And it 's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle . " 
Then she looks up , she 's looking up , and she says , " And I 'm 81 years old , and I do n't drive a car anymore . 
I still have to get to the store , and I ca n't carry a lot of things . " 
And it suddenly occurred to me , that among my many fears , were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that , fundamentally , you believe there 's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left , the sidewalks in these cities . 
When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk , then the eight foot for the parked car , then the three lanes , and then the other eight feet -- it 's -- that little piece is all that 's there . 
But she looks up and says this , and it occurs to me , well , kids are n't going to mind these things , and they do n't vote , and business people and then young adults are n't going to mind these things -- they 're pretty cool -- so I guess subliminally I was worried that it 's the older population that 's going to worry . 
So , having seen this , and having worried about it for eight years , the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys , call AARP , get an appointment right away . 
We 've got to show them this thing . 
And they took it to Washington ; they showed them ; and they 're going to be involved now , watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities , like Atlanta , where we 're doing trials to see if it really can , in fact , help re - energize their downtown . 
The bottom line is , whether you believe the United Nations , or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years , all human population growth on this planet will be in cities . 
In Asia alone , it will be over a billion people . 
They learned to start with cell phones . 
They did n't have to take the 100-year trip we took . 
They start at the top of the technology food chain . 
We 've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense , rich , green - space environment , without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it . 
Cars were not meant for parallel parking ; they 're wonderful machines to go between cities , but just think about it : we 've solved all the long - range , high - speed problems . 
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals . 
You do it in your sneakers . 
Not much has changed . 
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes . 
Your choice , when living in a city , if it 's now 10 minutes -- because at 30 minutes you want an alternative , whether it 's a bus , a train -- we 've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you 're going to keep parking those cars . 
But if you could put a pin in most cities , and imagine how far you could , if you had the time , walk in one half - hour , it 's the city . 
If you could make it fun , and make it eight or 10 minutes , you ca n't find your car , un - park your car , move your car , re - park your car and go somewhere ; you ca n't get to a cab or a subway . 
We could change the way people allocate their resources , the way this planet uses its energy , make it more fun . 
And we 're hoping to some extent history will say we were right . 
That 's Segway . This is a Stirling cycle engine ; this had been confused by a lot of things we 're doing . 
This little beast , right now , is producing a few hundred watts of electricity . 
Yes , it could be attached to this , and yes , on a kilogram of propane , you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose . 
Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it 'll burn any fuel , because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact , where most of the world you ca n't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet . 
We 've been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy source , starting way back with Johnson & Johnson , to run an iBOT , because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt - hours per kilogram in lead , 20 watt - hours per kilogram nickel - cadmium , 40 watt - hours per kilogram in nickel - metal hydride , 60 watt - hours per kilogram in lithium , 8,750 watt - hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars . 
But , in any event , if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it 's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove , if you can burn any fuel , it turns out to be pretty neat . 
It makes just enough electricity to , for instance , do this , which at night is enough electricity , in the rest of the world , as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out , can run computers and a light bulb . 
But more interestingly , the thermodynamics of this say , you 're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency . 
It does n't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity , you 'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat . 
If you wanted to boil water and re - condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour , it takes about 25 , a little over 25.3 kilowatt -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it . 
That 's so much energy , you could n't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way . 
Certainly , in the rest of the world , your choice is to devastate the place , turning everything that will burn into heat , or drink the water that 's available . 
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water . 
Depending on whose numbers you believe , it 's between 60 and 85,000 people per day . 
We do n't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world . 
We need water . 
And women should n't have to spend four hours a day looking for it , or watching their kids die . 
We figured out how to put a vapor - compression distiller on this thing , with a counter - flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat , then using a little bit of the electricity control that process , and for 450 watts , which is a little more than half of its waste heat , it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it . 
So if we put this box on here in a few years , could we have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds ? 
I do n't know , but we 'll try it . 
I better shut up .

Chris Anderson of WIRED on tech 's Long Tail 
I 'd like to speak about technology trends , which is something that many of you follow -- but we also follow , for related reasons . 
Obviously , being a technology magazine , technology trends are something that we write about and need to know about . 
But also it 's part of being any monthly magazine -- you live in the future . And we have a long lead - time . 
We have to plan issues many months in advance ; we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months , nine months down the road . So we 're in the forecasting business . 
We also , like a lot of companies , create a product that 's based on technology trends . 
In this case , ours is about ideas and information , and , if we 're lucky , some entertainment . But the concept 's quite the same . 
And so we have to understand not only why tech 's important , where it 's going , but also , very importantly , when -- the timing is everything . 
And it 's interesting , when you look at the predictions made during the peak of the boom in the 1990s , about e - commerce , or Internet traffic , or broadband adoption , or Internet advertising , they were all right -- they were just wrong in time . 
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later . 
But the difference of a few years on stock - market valuations is obviously extreme . And that 's why timing is everything . 
You 've probably seen something like this before . 
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve , which talks about kind of the trajectory of a technology 's lifespan . 
And just for fun , we put a bunch of technologies on it , to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak , or whether they were about to crash into the trough of disillusionment , or rise back in the slope of enlightenment , etc . 
And this is one way to do technology forecasting : get a sense of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn . 
We tend to do any technology that we think is sufficiently important ; we 'll typically do it twice . Once , we want to do it first . 
We want to be the first to do it , for the geeks who appreciate that , we 'll catch it right there at the technology - trigger . 
You can see in 1997 , we put Linux on the cover . 
But then it comes back . And sufficiently big technologies are going to hit the mainstream , and they 're going to burst out . 
And then it 's time to do it again . Last year . 
And that 's one way that we try to time technology trends . 
I 'd like to talk about a way of thinking about technology trends that I call my " grand unified theory of predicting the future , " but it 's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future . 
It 's based on the presumption , the observation even , that all important technologies go through four stages in their life -- at least one of the four stages , sometimes all four of the stages . 
And at each one of these stages , can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example , a critical price - line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world . It 's an inflection point . 
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology 's life is going to be , and maybe how you can do something about it . 
The first is the critical price . 
The first stage in a technology 's advance is that it 'll fall below a critical price . 
After it falls below a critical price , it will tend , if it 's successful , to rise above a critical mass , a penetration . 
Many technologies , at that point , displace another technology , and that 's another important point . 
And then finally , a lot of technologies commoditize . 
Towards the end of their life , they become nearly free . 
Each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it ; it 's an opportunity for the technology to change . 
And even if you missed , you know , the first boom of Wi - Fi -- you know , Wi - Fi did the critical price , it did the critical mass , but has n't done displacement yet , and has n't done free yet -- there 's still more opportunity in that . 
I 'd like to demonstrate what I mean by this by telling the story of the DVD , which is a technology which has done all of these . 
The DVD , as you know , was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive . But you can see that by 1998 , it had fallen below 400 dollars , and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold . 
And it started to take off . And you can see that the units started to trend up , the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off . 
The next thing it hit , a year later , was critical mass . In this case , 20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household . 
And what 's interesting here is that something else took off along with it : home - theater units . 
Suddenly you have a DVD in the house ; you 've got high - quality digital video ; you have a reason to have a big - screen television ; you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround - sound . 
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them , and bring the rest of your entertainment in . 
What 's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999 . 
Reed Hastings is here . He clearly saw that that was a moment , that was an inflection point that he could do something with . 
The next phase it hit was displacement . 
You can see around 2001 it finally out - sold the VCR . 
And here too , you can see the implications in the world at large . 
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD in a way that the video - rental stores could n't . 
Among the DVD 's many assets is that it 's very small ; you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply . 
That gave an advantage ; that was an implication of the technology 's rise that was n't obvious to everybody . 
And then finally , DVDs are approaching free . 
There 's a company called Apex , a no - name Chinese firm , who has , several times in the past year , been the number - one DVD seller in America . Their average price , for last year , was 48 dollars . 
You 're aware of the perhaps apocryphal Wal - Mart stampede over the 30-dollar DVD . 
But they 're getting very , very cheap , and look at the interesting implication of it . As they get cheaper , the premium brands , the Sonys and such , are losing market share , and the no - names , the Apexes , are gaining them . 
They 're being commodified , and that 's what happens when things go to zero . It 's a tough market out there . 
Now they 've introduced these four ways of looking at technology , these four stages of technology 's life . 
I 'd like to talk about some other technologies out there , just technologies on our radar -- and I 'll use this lens , these four , as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development . 
They 're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there -- they 're just examples of technologies that are in each one of these periods . 
But I think that the implications of them approaching these crossovers , these intersections , are interesting to think about . 
Start with gene sequencing . 
As you probably know , gene sequencing -- in a large part , because it 's built on computers -- is falling in price at a kind of a Moore 's Law - like level . 
It is now possible -- will be possible , and if Craig Venter indeed comes today , he may tell you something about this -- to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year . 
That 's as opposed to billions just a few years ago . 
You know , our ability to capture the tools of creation is getting closer and closer . 
What 's interesting is that at the same time , the number of genes that we 're discovering is rising very quickly . 
Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test . 
There will come a day when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done , very cheaply , if you want to know . You can learn about your own mosaic . 
Here 's another technology that 's approaching a critical price . 
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti - retroviral drug compounds and cocktails . 
In January 2000 , the price was 10,000 dollars , or 27 dollars a day . 
The generics came in , first in Brazil and elsewhere , and the effect was just dramatic on pricing . 
Today it 's less than 50 cents a day . 
And what 's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity , if you look at the correlation between these two , as the anti - retrovirals come down , the number of people you can treat goes radically up . And the Clinton Foundation and WHO believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 -- two million in sub - Saharan Africa . 
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that . 
Linux is another good example . 
Now we 've switched to critical mass . 
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass . 
If you look here , here 's Linux in red , and it 's hit 20 percent . 
Interestingly , it 's done a crossover before , but not the crossovers that matter . 
The crossover that 's going to matter is the one with the blue . 
But you can look and see the direction those lines are going , you can see that at the 20 percent , it 's now taken seriously . 
It 's not just for the geeks any more . 
That is , I imagine , what people in Redmond wake up in the middle of the night thinking about . 
Another technology that we see all around us out here is hybrid cars . 
I do n't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004 , but they 're fantastic . 
And if you look at the trends here , by about 2008 -- and I do n't think this is a crazy forecast -- they 'll be two percent of auto sales . 
Two percent is n't 20 percent , but in the car business , which is slow moving , that 's huge ; that 's arrival . 
At two percent , you start seeing them on the roads everywhere . 
And what 's interesting about the hybrids taking off is you 've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry . 
It 's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years . 
And once you have electric motors , you can do anything : you can change the structure of the car in any way you want . 
You can have regenerative braking ; you can have drive - by - wire ; you can have replaceable body shapes -- it 's a little thing that starts with a hybrid , but it can lead to a whole new era of the car . 
Voice Over IP is something you may have heard something about . 
Again , it 's kind of coming out of nowhere ; it 's a little hard to use right now . 
There 's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype . 
Look at these numbers . They launched it in August of last year ; they already have nearly four million registered users -- that 's critical mass . 
And the same thing 's happening on the carrier side . 
You 're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional telecom standards . This is a tipping point -- if Malcolm 's here , forgive me -- and it 's going to change the economics , and the speed , and the players in the industry . 
It 's going to look a little bit like that . 
And finally , free . Free is really , really interesting . 
Free is something that comes with digital , because the reproduction costs are essentially free . It comes with IP , because it 's such an efficient protocol . It comes with fiber optics , because there 's so much bandwidth . 
Free is really , you know , the gift of Silicon Valley to the world . 
It 's an economic force ; it 's a technical force . 
It 's a deflationary force , if not handled right . 
It is abundance , as opposed to scarcity . 
Free is probably the most interesting thing . 
And here you have just the number of songs that can be stored on a hard drive . 
You know , there could be a film 's [ unclear ] there , but it 's basically , every song ever made could be stored on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008 . It takes that entire element , the physical element , of songs off the table . 
And you 've seen the numbers . 
I mean , you know , the music industry is imploding in front of our very eyes , and Hollywood 's worried as well . 
They 're facing a force that they have n't faced before . 
And their response is draconian , and not necessarily the one that 's going to get them out of this . 
And finally , I 'll give you one last example of free -- perhaps the most powerful of all . I mentioned fiber optics -- their abundance tends to make things free . 
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute . 
And what 's interesting is that it was just 1990 when it was more than two dollars a minute . 
India had , still has , a regulated phone system and so did we . 
It was surprisingly non - innovative , moved very slowly , but then there was just so much fiber out there , you could n't hold back , and look how quickly the price fell . 
It 's seven cents a minute , in many cases . 
And the consequence of cheap phone calling , free phone calling , to India , is the pissed - off programmer , is the outsourcing . 
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization and one of the most powerful economic tools that we 're seeing in our world today . 
The force of India , and then China , and any other country that can contact our markets and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free -- is just beginning to be felt . 
And I think that 's probably one of the most important technology trends that we 're looking at today . 
Thank you .

Jacqueline Novogratz : A third way to think about aid 
Clearly , we 're living in a moment of crisis . 
Arguably the financial markets have failed us and the aid system is failing us , and yet I stand firmly with the optimists who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive . 
Because of some of technologies we 've been talking about . 
Because of the resources , the skills , and certainly the surge of talent we 're seeing all around the world , with the mindset to create change . 
And we 've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen , who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower , but that we 've got to engage in a different way with the world . 
And by definition , every one of you who is in this room must consider yourself a global soul , a global citizen . 
You work on the front lines . And you 've seen the best and the worst that human beings can do for one another and to one another . 
And no matter what country you live or work in , you 've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of , even in their most ordinariness . 
Today there is a raging debate as to how best we lift people out of poverty , how best we release their energies . 
On the one hand , we have people that say the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out . 
And on the other we have people who say the problem is that we need more aid . 
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems . 
We call it patient capital . 
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent in Africa since 1970 and say , and what do we have but environmental degradation and incredible levels of poverty , rampant corruption ? 
They use Mobutu as metaphor . 
And their policy prescription is to make government more accountable , focus on the capital markets , invest , do n't give anything away . 
On the other side , as I said , there are those who say the problem is that we need more money . 
That when it comes to the rich , we 'll bail out and we 'll hand a lot of aid , but when it comes to our poor brethren , we want little to do with it . 
They point to the successes of aid : the eradication of smallpox , and the distribution of tens of millions of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals . 
Both sides are right . 
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other . 
Even more problematic , they 're not listening to poor people themselves . 
After 25 years of working on issues of poverty and innovation , it 's true that there are probably no more market - oriented individuals on the planet than low - income people . 
They must navigate markets daily , making micro - decisions , dozens and dozens , to move their way through society , and yet if a single catastrophic health problem impacts their family , they could be put back into poverty , sometimes for generations . 
And so we need both the market and we need aid . 
Patient capital works between , and tries to take the best of both . 
It 's money that 's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities and are building solutions to healthcare , water , housing , alternative energy , thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity , but as individual customers , consumers , clients , people who want to make decisions in their own lives . 
Patient capital requires that we have incredible tolerance for risk , a long time horizon in terms of allowing those entrepreneurs time to experiment , to use the market as the best listening device that we have , and the expectation of below - market returns , but outsized social impact . 
It recognizes that the market has its limitation , and so patient capital also works with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy to include all people . 
Now , entrepreneurs need patient capital for three reasons . 
First , they tend to work in markets where people make one , two , three dollars a day and they are making all of their decisions within that income level . 
Second , the geographies in which they work have terrible infrastructure -- no roads to speak of , sporadic electricity and high levels of corruption . 
Third , they are often creating markets . 
Even if you 're bringing clean water for the first time into rural villages , it is something new . 
And so many low - income people have seen so many failed promises broken and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them that building trust takes a lot of time , takes a lot of patience . 
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance . 
Not only to build the systems , the business models that allow us to reach low income people in a sustainable way , but to connect those business to other markets , to governments , to corporations -- real partnerships if we want to get to scale . 
I want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation . 
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur named Amitabha Sadangi from India , who 'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet . 
And he was expressing his frustration that the aid market had bypassed low - income farmers altogether , despite the fact that 200 million farmers alone in India make under a dollar a day . 
They were creating subsidies either for large farms , or they were giving inputs to the farmers that they thought they should use , rather than that the farmers wanted to use . 
At the same time Amitabha was obsessed with this drip irrigation technology that had been invented in Israel . 
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water directly to the stalk of the plant . 
And it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green . 
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers , because these systems were both too expensive , and they were constructed for fields that were too large . 
The average small village farmer works on two acres or less . 
And so , Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves , because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have . 
And he used three fundamental principles . 
The first one was miniaturization . 
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre , even if he had two , because it was too frightening , given all that he had at stake . 
Second , it had to be extremely affordable . 
In other words , that risk on the quarter acre needed to be repaid in a single harvest , or else they would n't take the risk . 
And third , it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable . 
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre , the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth . 
As of today , IDE India , Amitabha 's organization , has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average , but this did n't happen overnight . 
In fact , when you go back to the beginning , there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day , that were known to be some of the most risk - averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors , agriculture . 
And so we needed grants . And he used significant grants to research , to experiment , to fail , to innovate and try again . 
And when he had a prototype and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers , that 's when patient capital could come in . 
And we helped him build a company , for profit , that would build on IDE 's knowledge , and start looking at sales and exports , and be able to tap into other kinds of capital . 
Secondarily , we wanted to see if we could export this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries . 
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan . 
And while , again , you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in India into Pakistan , just to get the permits , over time we were able to start a company with Dr. Sono , who runs a large community development organization in the Thar Desert , which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country . 
And though that company has just started , our assumption is that there too we 'll see the impact on millions . 
But drip irrigation is n't the only innovation . 
We 're starting to see these happening all around the world . 
In Arusha , Tanzania , A to Z Textile Manufacturing has worked in partnership with us , with UNICEF , with the Global Fund , to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people , mostly women . 
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets for Africans around the world . 
Lifespring Hospital is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India to bring quality , affordable maternal health care to low - income women , and it 's been so successful that it 's currently building a new hospital every 35 days . 
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to reinvent a completely broken industry , building an ambulance service in Bombay that would use the technology of Google Earth , a sliding scale pricing system so that all people could have access , and a severe and public decision not to engage in any form of corruption . 
So that in the terrorist attacks of November they were the first responder , and are now beginning to scale , because of partnership . 
They 've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances , and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies in India . 
This idea of scale is critical . 
Because we 're starting to see these enterprises reach hundreds of thousands of people . All of the ones I discussed have reached at least a quarter million people . 
But that 's obviously not enough . 
And it 's where the idea of partnership becomes so important . 
Whether it 's by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets , government itself , or partner with major corporations , there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation . 
President Obama understands that . 
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund to focus on what works in this country , and look at how we can scale it . 
And I would submit that it 's time to consider a global innovation fund that would find these entrepreneurs around the world who really have innovations , not only for their country , but ones that we can use in the developed world as well . 
Invest financial assistance , but also management assistance . 
And then measure the returns , both from a financial perspective and from a social impact perspective . 
When we think about new approaches to aid , it 's impossible not to talk about Pakistan . 
We 've had a rocky relationship with that country and , in all fairness , the United States has not always been a very reliable partner . 
But again I would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen . 
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund , we could use this time to invest not directly in government , though we would have government 's blessing , nor in international experts , but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country . 
People like Rashani Zafar , who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country , and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country . 
And Tasneem Siddiqui , who developed a way called incremental housing , where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers into safe , affordable community housing . 
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation that are building schools across the country . 
It 's not hyperbole to say that these civil society institutions and these social entrepreneurs are building real alternatives to the Taliban . 
I 've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now , and those of you who 've also worked there can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population , and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature . 
President Kennedy said that those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable . 
I would say that the converse is true . 
That these social leaders who really are looking at innovation and extending opportunity to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day , provide real pathways to hope . 
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan , while we need to strengthen the judiciary , build greater stability , we also need to think about lifting those leaders who can be role models for the rest of the world . 
On one of my last visits to Pakistan , I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert . 
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn . 
It was about 115 degrees . 
And we drove for eight hours along this moonscape - like landscape with very little color , lots of heat , very little discussion , because we were exhausted . 
And finally , at the end of the journey , I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon . 
And as we got closer , its significance became apparent . 
That there in the desert was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall . 
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth had gotten access to a technology that had allowed him to change his own life . 
His name was Raja , and he had kind , twinkly hazel eyes and warm expressive hands that reminded me of my father . 
And he said it was the first dry season in his entire life that he had n't taken his 12 children and 50 grandchildren on a two day journey across the desert to work as day laborers at a commercial farm for about 50 cents a day . 
Because he was building these crops . 
And with the money he earned he could stay this year . 
And for the first time ever in three generations , his children would go to school . 
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons . 
And he said , " Of course I will . 
Because I do n't want them discriminated against anymore . " 
When we think about solutions to poverty , we can not deny individuals their fundamental dignity . 
Because at the end of the day , dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth . 
And what 's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors who are building innovations that recognize that what people want is freedom and choice and opportunity . 
Because that is where dignity really starts . 
Martin Luther King said that love without power is anemic and sentimental , and that power without love is reckless and abusive . 
Our generation has seen both approaches tried , and often fail . 
But I think our generation also might be the first to have the courage to embrace both love and power . 
For that is what we 'll need , as we move forward to dream and imagine what it will really take to build a global economy that includes all of us , and to finally extend that fundamental proposition that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet . 
The time for us to begin innovating and looking for new solutions , a cross sector , is now . 
I can only talk from my own experience , but in eight years of running Acumen fund , I 've seen the power of patient capital . 
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking , but to truly build systems that have created more than 25,000 jobs and delivered tens of millions of services and products to some of the poorest people on the planet . 
I know it works . 
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work . 
And so I urge you , in whatever sector you work , in whatever job you do , to start thinking about how we might build solutions that start from the perspective of those we 're trying to help . 
Rather than what we think that they might need . 
It will take embracing the world with both arms . 
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability , with a sense of integrity and perseverance . 
And yet these are the very qualities for which men and women have been honored throughout the generations . 
And there is so much good that we can do . 
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert . 
Thank you .

Mena Trott on blogs 
Over the past couple of days as I 've been preparing for my speech , I 've become more and more nervous about what I 'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people . 
Being on the same stage as Al Gore , who was the first person I ever voted for . 
And -- So I was getting pretty nervous and , you know , I did n't know that Chris sits on the stage , and that 's more nerve wracking . 
But then I started thinking about my family . 
I started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great - grandfather , and I realized that I had all of these Teds going through my blood stream -- -- that I had to consider this " my element . " 
So , who am I ? 
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband . 
We have about 125 people internationally . 
If you looked in the book , you saw this , which I really was appalled by . 
And because I wanted to impress you all with slides , since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs , I made a graph that moves , and I talk about the makeup of me . 
So , besides this freakish thing , this is my science slide . This is math , and this is science ; this is genetics . 
This is my grandmother , and this is where I get this mouth . 
I 'm a blogger , which , probably to a lot of you , means different things . 
You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha , where a blogger talked about how you hack , or break into , a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen , and it spread all over . Kryptonite had to adjust the lock , and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns . 
You may have heard about Rathergate , which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the " th " in 111 is not typesetted on an old typewriter ; it 's on Word . 
Bloggers exposed this , or they worked hard to expose this . 
You know , blogs are scary . This is what you see . 
I see this , and I 'm sure scared -- and I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs , because this is not something that 's friendly . 
But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media , and , you know , these are great examples . These people are reaching thousands , if not millions , of readers , and that 's incredibly important . 
During the hurricane , you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog , updating it frequently . This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools . 
You have my friend , who has a blog on digital -- on PDRs , personal recorders . 
He makes enough money , just by running ads , to support his family up in Oregon . 
That 's all he does now , and this is something that blogs have made possible . 
And then you have something like this , which is Interplast . 
It 's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it . 
Children with cleft palates will get it , and they document their story . This is wonderful . 
I am not that caring . 
I talk about myself . That 's what I am . I 'm a blogger . 
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing , and I am an expert on this person , and so I write about it . 
And -- the short story about my blog : it started in 2001 . I was 23 . 
I was n't happy with my job , because I was a designer , but I was n't being really stimulated . 
I was an English major in college . I did n't have any use for it , but I missed writing . So , I started to write a blog and I started to create things like these little stories . 
This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old , and how I went to a YMCA camp -- Christian camp -- and basically by the end , I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk . They could n't find me . 
They sent a search party , and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself , jumped off Bible Peak . 
You can laugh , this is OK . 
This is me . 
This is what happened to me . 
And when I started my blog it was really this one goal -- I said , I am not going to be famous to the world , but I could be famous to people on the Internet . 
And I set a goal . I said , " I 'm going to win an award , " because I had never won an award in my entire life . 
And I said , " I 'm going to win this award -- the South by Southwest Weblog award . " 
And I won it . I reached all of these people , and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday . 
And then I wrote a post about a banjo . 
I wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo -- a $ 300 banjo , which is a lot of money , and I do n't play instruments ; I do n't know anything about music . 
I like music , and I like banjos , and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing , and I said , " I could do that . " 
And I said to my husband , I said , " Ben , can I buy a banjo ? " And he 's like , " No . " 
And my husband -- this is my husband , who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me , " You can not buy a banjo . 
You 're just like your dad , " who " collects " instruments . 
And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him ; he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo . 
And those people who know me understood my joke . 
This is Mena , this is how I make a joke at people . 
Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant : this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog . 
And if he knew I was showing this right now -- I put this in today -- he would kill me . 
But the thing was , I wrote this , and my friends read it , and they 're like , " Oh , that Mena , she wrote a post about , you know , wanting a stupid thing and being stupid . " 
But I got emails from people that said , " Oh my God , your husband is such an asshole . 
How much money does he spend on beer in a year ? 
You could take that money and buy your banjo . 
Why do n't you open a separate account ? " 
I 've been with him since I was 17 years old . We 've never had a separate bank account . 
They said , " Separate your bank account -- spend your money ; spend his money . That 's it . " 
And then I got people saying , " Leave him . " 
And -- I was like , " OK , what , who are these people ? 
And why are they reading this ? " 
And I realized : I do n't want to reach these people . 
I do n't want to write for this public audience . 
And I started to kill my blog slowly . 
I 'm like , I do n't want to write this anymore , and I slowly and slowly -- And I did tell personal stories from time to then . 
I wrote this one , and I put this up because of Einstein today . 
And I 'm going to get choked up , because this is my first pet , and she passed away two years ago . 
And I decided to break from , " I do n't really write about my public life , " because I wanted to give her a little memorial . 
But anyways . 
It 's these sort of personal stories . You know , you read the blogs about politics , or about media , and gossip and all these things . 
These are out there , but it 's more of the personal that interests me , and this is -- this is who I am . 
You see Norman Rockwell . And you have art critics say , " Norman Rockwell is not art . 
Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms , and this is not something to be considered high art . " 
And I think this is one of the most important things to us as humans . 
These things resonate with us , and , if you think about blogs , you think of high art blogs , the history paintings about , you know , all biblical stories , and then you have this . 
These are the blogs that interest me : the people who just tell stories . 
One story is about this baby , and his name is Odin . 
His father was a blogger . 
And he was writing his blog one day , and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks . 
And he never expected this . 
One day it was normal ; the next day it was hell . 
And this is a one - pound baby . 
So Odin was documented every single day . 
Pictures were taken every day : day one , day two ... 
You have day nine -- they 're talking about his apnea ; day 39 -- he gets pneumonia . 
His baby is so small , and I 've never encountered such a just -- a disturbing image , but just -- just so heartfelt . 
You 're reading this as this happens , so on day 55 , everybody reads that he 's having failures : breathing failures and heart failures , and it 's slowing down , and you do n't know what to expect . 
But then it gets better . Day 96 he goes home . 
And you see this post . 
That 's not something that you 're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels , and people are excited about it . 
Twenty - eight comments . That 's not a huge amount of people reading , but 28 people matter . 
And today he is a healthy baby , who , if you read his blog -- it 's Snowdeal.org , his father 's blog -- he is taking pictures of him still , because he is still his son and he is , I think , at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital . 
So , blogs . 
So what ? You 've probably heard these things before . 
We talked about the WELL , and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history . 
But I think blogs are basically just an evolution , and that 's where we are today . 
It 's this record of who you are , your persona . 
You have your Google search where you say , " Hey , what is Mena Trott ? " 
And then you find these things and you 're happy or unhappy . 
But then you also find people 's blogs , and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic , but things that interest them . 
And we talk about the world flattens as being this panel , and I am very optimistic . 
Whenever I think about blogs I 'm like , " Oh , we 've got to reach all these people . " 
Millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people . 
You know , we 're getting into China , we want to be there , but you know , there are so many people who wo n't have the access to write a blog . 
But to see something like the $ 100 computer is amazing , because it 's a -- blogging software is simple . 
We have a successful company because of timing , and because of perseverance , but it 's simple stuff -- it 's not rocket science . 
And so , that 's an amazing thing to consider . 
So , the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important . 
We started with a slide of my Teds , and I had to add this slide , because I knew that the minute I showed this , my mom -- my mom will see this deck somehow , because she does read my blog -- and she 'll say , " Why was n't there a picture of me ? " 
This is my mom . So , I have all of the people that I know of . 
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know in terms of my direct line . 
I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before , and this one I grew up with , looking at constantly . 
I would spend hours looking at just the connections , saying , " Oh , the little kid up at the top has red hair ; so does that first generation up there . " 
And just these little things . 
This is not science , but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line . 
So , that has always influenced me . 
I have this record , this 1910 census of another Grabowski -- that 's my maiden name -- and there 's a Theodore , because there 's always a Theodore . 
This is all I have . I have a couple of facts about somebody . 
I have their date of birth , and their age , and what they did in their household , if they spoke English , and that 's it . That 's all I know of these people . 
And it 's pretty sad , because I only go back five generations , and then it 's it . I do n't even know what happens on my mom 's side , because she 's from Cuba and I do n't have that many things . 
And just doing this I spent time in the archives -- that 's another thing why my husband 's a saint -- I spent time in the Washington archives , just sitting there , looking for these things . Now it 's online , but he sat through that . 
And so you have this record and , you know , this is my great - great - grandmother . 
This is the only picture I have . And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs ; to think about the people who are on those $ 100 computers talking about who they are , sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing . 
Another photo that has greatly influenced me , or a series of photos , is this project that 's done by an Argentinean man and his wife . 
And he 's basically taking a picture of his family everyday for the past , what is ' 76 -- 20 , oh my God , I 'm ' 77 -- 29 years ? Twenty - nine years . 
There was a joke , originally , about my graph that I left out , which is : you see all this math ? I 'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100 , because that 's my skill set . 
So you have these people aging , and now this is them today , or last year , and that 's a powerful thing to have , to be able to track this . 
I wish that I would have this of my family . 
I know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren , or my great - grandchildren , if I ever have children -- what I am going to -- who I was , so I do something that 's very narcissistic : I am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me , because it captures a moment in time everyday . 
I take a picture of myself -- I 've been doing this since last year -- every single day . 
And , you know , it 's the same picture ; it 's basically the same person . 
Only a couple of people read it . I do n't write this for this audience ; I 'm showing it now , but I would go insane if this was really public . 
About four people probably read it , and they tell me , you know , " You have n't updated " -- I 'm probably going to get people telling me I have n't updated -- but this is something that 's amazing , because I can go back to a day -- I can go back to April 2005 , and say , what was I doing this day ? I look at it , I know exactly . 
It 's this visual cue that is so important to what we do . 
I put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures . 
And I remember instantly : I am in Germany in this -- I had to go for a one - day trip . 
I was sick , and I was in a hotel room , and I wanted not to be there . And so you see these things . 
It 's not just always smiling . Now I 've kind of evolved it , so I have this look . 
If you look at my driver 's license I have the same look , and it 's -- it 's -- a pretty disturbing thing but it 's something that is really important . 
And the last story I really want to tell is this story , because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what I 'm doing . 
And I 'll probably get choked up , because I tend to when I talk about this . 
So , this woman , her name was Emma , and she was a blogger on our service , TypePad . And she was a beta tester , so she was there right when we opened -- you know , there were 100 people -- and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer . 
She was writing and writing and writing , and we all started reading it , because we had so few blogs on the service , we could keep track of everyone . 
And she was writing one day , and , you know , then she disappeared for a little bit . 
And her sister came on , and she said that Emma had passed away . And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional , and it was a very hard day at the company . 
And this was one of those instances where I realized how much blogging affects our relationship , and flattening this sort of world . 
That this woman is in England , and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing . 
But the big thing that really influenced us was , her sister wrote to me , and she said , you know , and she wrote on this blog , that -- writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her , and being able to talk to people , being able to share what was going on , and being able to write and receive comments . 
And that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that , and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing , and that the idea that blogging does n't have to be scary , that we do n't always have to be attack of the blogs , that we can be people who are open , and wanting to help and talk to people . 
That was an amazing thing . 
And -- and so I printed out her -- or I sent a PDF of her blog to her family , and they passed it out at her memorial service , and even in her obituary , they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life . 
And that 's a huge thing . 
So , this is her legacy , and I think that my call to action to all of you is : you know , think about blogs , think about what they are , think about what you 've thought of them , and then actually do it , because it 's something that is really going to change our lives . 
So , thank you .

Barbara Block : Tagging tuna in the deep ocean 
I 've been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty , form and function of giant bluefin tuna . 
Bluefin are warmblooded like us . 
They 're the largest of the tunas , the second - largest fish in the sea -- bony fish . 
They actually are a fish that is endothermic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal . 
That 's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium . 
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design it 's powered for ocean swimming . 
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins , gets lift , powers its movements with a lunate tail . 
It 's actually got a naked skin for most of its body , so it reduces friction with the water . 
This is what one of nature 's finest machines . 
Now , bluefin were revered by Man for all of human history . 
For 4,000 years , we fished sustainably for this animal , and it 's evidenced in the art that we see from thousands of years ago . 
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France . 
They 're on coins that date back 3,000 years . 
This fish was revered by humankind . 
It was fished sustainably till all of time , except for our generation . 
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go -- there is a gold rush on Earth , and this is a gold rush for bluefin . 
There are traps that fish sustainably up until recently . 
And yet , the type of fishing going on today , with pens , with enormous stakes , is really wiping bluefin ecologically off the planet . 
Now bluefin , in general , goes to one place : Japan . 
Some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin . 
They 're delectable muscle , rich in fat -- absolutely taste delicious . 
And that 's their problem ; we 're eating them to death . 
Now in the Atlantic , the story is pretty simple . 
Bluefin have two populations : one large , one small . 
The North American population is fished at about 2,000 ton . 
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna -- is fished at tremendous levels : 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year . 
The result is whether you 're looking at the West or the Eastern bluefin population , there 's been tremendous decline on both sides , as much as 90 percent if you go back with your baseline to 1950 . 
For that , bluefin have been given a status equivalent to tigers , to lions , to certain African elephants and to pandas . 
These fish have been proposed for an endangered species listing in the past two months . 
They were voted on and rejected just two weeks ago , despite outstanding science that shows from two committees this fish meets the criteria of CITES I. 
And if it 's tunas you do n't care about , perhaps you might be interested that international long lines and pursing chase down tunas and bycatch animals such as leatherbacks , sharks , marlin , albatross . 
These animals and their demise occurs in the tuna fisheries . 
The challenge we face is that we know very little about tuna , and everyone in the room knows what it looks like when an African lion takes down its prey . 
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed . 
This tuna symbolizes what 's the problem for all of us in the room . 
It 's the 21st century , but we really have only just begun to really study our oceans in a deep way . 
Technology has come of age that 's allowing us to see the Earth from space and go deep into the seas remotely . 
And we 've got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean realm works . 
Most of us from the ship -- even I -- look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea . 
We do n't know where the structure is . 
We ca n't tell where are the watering holes like we can on an African plain . 
We ca n't see the corridors , and we ca n't see what it is that brings together a tuna , a leatherback and an albatross . 
We 're only just beginning to understand how the physical oceanography and the biological oceanography come together to create a seasonal force that actually causes the upwelling that might make a hot spot a hope spot . 
The reasons these challenges are great is that technically it 's difficult to go to sea . 
It 's hard to study a bluefin on its turf , the entire Pacific realm . 
It 's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark and try to put a tag on it . 
And then imagine being Bruce Mate 's team from OSU , getting up close to a blue whale and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays , an engineering challenge we 've yet to really overcome . 
So the story of our team , a dedicated team , is fish and chips . 
We basically are taking the same satellite phone parts , or the same parts that are in your computer , chips . 
We 're putting them together in unusual ways , and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before . 
And for the first time , we 're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset . 
Now , I 've been working with tunas for over 15 years . 
I have the privilege of being a partner with the Monterey Bay Aquarium . 
We 've actually taken a sliver of the ocean , put it behind glass , and we together have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display . 
When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning , we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean , one of the only places on Earth you can see giant bluefin swim by . 
We can see in their beauty of form and function , their ceaseless activity . 
They 're flying through their space , ocean space . 
And we can bring two million people a year into contact with this fish and show them its beauty . 
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium . 
Here , for over 14 or 15 years , we 've actually brought in both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity . 
We 'd been studying these fish , but first we had to learn how to husbandry them . 
What do they like to eat ? 
What is it that they 're happy with ? 
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin -- it 's pretty amazing . It feels wonderful . 
And then , better yet , we 've got our own version of tuna whisperers , our own Chuck Farwell , Alex Norton , who can take a big tuna and in one motion , put it into an envelope of water , so that we can actually work with the tuna and learn the techniques it takes to not injure this fish who never sees a boundary in the open sea . 
Jeff and Jason there , are scientists who are going to take a tuna and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill , a flume . 
And that tuna thinks it 's going to Japan , but it 's staying in place . 
We 're actually measuring its oxygen consumption , its energy consumption . 
We 're taking this data and building better models . 
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view -- I begin to wonder : how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did ? 
So take a look at that animal . 
That 's the closest you 'll probably ever get . 
Now , the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean . 
So in a program called Tag - A - Giant we 've actually gone from Ireland to Canada , from Corsica to Spain . 
We 've fished with many nations around the world in an effort to basically put electronic computers inside giant tunas . 
We 've actually tagged 1,100 tunas . 
And I 'm going to show you three clips , because I tagged 1,100 tunas . 
It 's a very hard process , but it 's a ballet . 
We bring the tuna out , we measure it . 
A team of fishers , captains , scientists and technicians work together to keep this animal out of the ocean for about four to five minutes . 
We put water over its gills , give it oxygen . 
And then with a lot of effort , after tagging , putting in the computer , making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment , we send this fish back into the sea . 
And when it goes , we 're always happy . 
We see a flick of the tail . 
And from our data that gets collected , when that tag comes back , because a fisher returns it for a thousand - dollar reward , we can get tracks beneath the sea for up to five years now , on a backboned animal . 
Now sometimes the tunas are really large , such as this fish off Nantucket . 
But that 's about half the size of the biggest tuna we 've ever tagged . 
It takes a human effort , a team effort , to bring the fish in . 
In this case , what we 're going to do is put a pop - up satellite archival tag on the tuna . 
This tag rides on the tuna , senses the environment around the tuna and actually will come off the fish , detach , float to the surface and send back to Earth - orbiting satellites position data estimated by math on the tag , pressure data and temperature data . 
And so what we get then from the pop - up satellite tag is we get away from having to have a human interaction to recapture the tag . 
Both the electronic tags I 'm talking about are expensive . 
These tags have been engineered by a variety of teams in North America . 
They are some of our finest instruments , our new technology in the ocean today . 
One community in general has given more to help us than any other community . 
And that 's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina . 
There are two villages , Harris and Morehead City , every winter for over a decade , held a party called Tag - A - Giant , and together , fishers worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish . 
In this case , we 're actually going to measure the fish . 
We 're going to do something that in recent years we 've started : take a mucus sample . 
Watch how shiny the skin is ; you can see my reflection there . 
And from that mucus , we can get gene profiles , we can get information on gender , checking the pop - up tag one more time , and then it 's out in the ocean . 
And this is my favorite . 
With the help of my former postdoc , Gareth Lawson , this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna . 
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean . 
The warm is the Gulf Stream , the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine . 
That 's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring -- but it ca n't get there . It 's too cold . 
But then it warms up , and the tuna pops in , gets some fish , maybe comes back to home base , goes in again and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina and then on to the Bahamas . 
And my favorite scene , three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico . 
Three tunas tagged . 
Astronomically , we 're calculating positions . 
They 're coming together . That could be tuna sex -- and there it is . 
That is where the tuna spawn . 
So from data like this , we 're able now to put the map up , and in this map you see thousands of positions generated by this decade and a half of tagging . 
And now we 're showing that tunas on the western side go to the eastern side . 
So two populations of tunas -- that is , we have a Gulf population , one that we can tag -- they go to the Gulf of Mexico , I showed you that -- and a second population . 
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas -- are European tunas that go back to the Med . 
On the hot spots -- the hope spots -- they 're mixed populations . 
And so what we 've done with the science is we 're showing the International Commission , building new models , showing them that a two - stock no - mixing model -- to this day , used to reject the CITES treaty -- that model is n't the right model . 
This model , a model of overlap , is the way to move forward . 
So we can then predict where management places should be . 
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean are places where the single species , the single population , can be captured . 
These become forthright in places we need to protect . 
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is , I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish , because they manage their fisheries well , they 're doing a good job . 
But in the international realm , where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild , these are the places that we have to make hope spots in . 
That 's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna . 
Now in a second project called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics , we took on the planet as a team , those of us in the Census of Marine Life . 
And , funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others , we were able to actually go in , in our project -- we 're one of 17 field programs and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators , not just tunas . 
So what we 've done is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska , met salmon shark on their home territory , followed them catching salmon and then went in and figured out that , if we take a salmon and put it on a line , we can actually take up a salmon shark -- This is the cousin of the white shark -- and very carefully -- note , I say " very carefully , " -- we can actually keep it calm , put a hose in its mouth , keep it off the deck and then tag it with a satellite tag . 
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home and send in a message . 
And that shark leaping there , if you look carefully , has an antenna . 
It 's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag jumping after salmon , sending home its data . 
Salmon sharks are n't the only sharks we tag . 
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter - level resolution on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer . 
Salmon sharks go down to the tropics to pup and come into Monterey . 
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there -- and Sal Jorgensen . 
They can throw out a target -- it 's a carpet shaped like a seal -- and in will come a white shark , a curious critter that will come right up to our 16-ft . boat . 
It 's a several thousand - pound animal . 
And we 'll wind in the target . 
And we 'll place an acoustic tag that says , " OMSHARK 10165 , " or something like that , acoustically with a ping . 
And then we 'll put on a satellite tag that will give us the long - distance journeys with the light - based geolocation algorithms solved on the computer that 's on the fish . 
So in this case , Sal 's looking at two tags there , and there they are : the white sharks of California going off to the white shark cafe and coming back . 
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues , blue sharks . 
And now , together , what we can see on this ocean of color that 's temperature , we can see ten - day worms of makos and salmon sharks . 
We have white sharks and blue sharks . 
For the first time , an ecoscape as large as ocean - scale , showing where the sharks go . 
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable : three teams tagged 1,700 tunas , bluefin , yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out , pick up juvenile tunas , put in the tags that actually have the sensors , stick out the tuna and then let them go . 
They get returned , and when they get returned , here on a NASA numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor , returning to the Western Pacific . 
Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals with tags that are glued on their heads , that come off when they slough . 
These elephant seals cover half an ocean , take data down to 1,800 feet -- amazing data . 
And then there 's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters wearing tuna tags , light - based tags , that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back , journeys of 35,000 nautical miles we had never seen before . 
But now with light - based geolocation tags that are very small , we can actually see these journeys . 
Same thing with Laysan albatross who travel an entire ocean on a trip sometimes , up to the same zone the tunas use . 
You can see why they might be caught . 
Then there 's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande tagging leatherbacks that go right past where we are . 
And Scott Benson 's team that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia all the way to Monterey . 
So what we can see on this moving ocean is we can finally see where the predators are . 
We can actually see how they 're using ecospaces as large as an ocean . 
And from this information , we can begin to map the hope spots . 
So this is just three years of data right here -- and there 's a decade of this data . 
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities that these animals are going on . 
So what we 're able to do with this information is boil it down to hot spots , 4,000 deployments , a huge herculean task , 2,000 tags in an area , shown here for the first time , off the California coast , that appears to be a gathering place . 
And then for sort of an encore from these animals , they 're helping us . 
They 're carrying instruments that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters . 
They 're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles . 
Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles . 
This data , when visualized , is captivating to watch . 
We still have n't figured out best how to visualize the data . 
And then , as these animals swim and give us the information that 's important to climate issues , we also think it 's critical to get this information to the public , to engage the public with this kind of data . 
We did this with the Great Turtle Race -- tagged turtles , brought in four million hits . 
And now with Google 's Oceans , we can actually put a white shark in that ocean . 
And when we do and it swims , we see this magnificent bathymetry that the shark knows is there on its path as it goes from California to Hawaii . 
But maybe Mission Blue can fill in that ocean that we ca n't see . 
We 've got the capacity , NASA has the ocean . 
We just need to put it together . 
So in conclusion , we know where Yellowstone is for North America ; it 's off our coast . 
We have the technology that 's shown us where it is . 
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue is increasing the biologging capacity . 
How is it that we can actually take this type of activity elsewhere ? 
And then finally -- to basically get the message home -- maybe use live links from animals such as blue whales and white sharks . 
Make killer apps , if you will . 
A lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge . 
Let 's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone . 
That way we do away with a few internet myths . 
So we can save the bluefin tuna . 
We can save the white shark . 
We have the science and technology . 
Hope is here . Yes we can . 
We need just to apply this capacity further in the oceans . 
Thank you .

After he ended up on a watch list by accident , Hasan Elahi was advised by his local FBI agents to let them know when he was traveling . He did that and more ... much more .

Hasan Elahi : FBI , here I am ! 
Hi there . I 'm Hasan . I 'm an artist . 
And usually when I tell people I 'm an artist , they just look at me and say , " Do you paint ? " 
or " What kind of medium do you work in ? " 
Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique . 
So what I 'm really interested in is creative problem solving . 
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago . 
So let me show you a little of that . 
So it started over here . 
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002 . 
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas . 
And as I was coming back , well I was taken by the FBI , met by an FBI agent , and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- " Where were you ? What were you doing ? Who were you talking with ? 
Why were you there ? Who pays for your trips ? " -- all these little details . 
And then literally just out of nowhere , the guy asks me , " Where were you September 12th ? " 
And when most of us get asked , " Where were you September 12th ? " 
or any date for that fact , it 's like , " I do n't exactly remember , but I can look it up for you . " 
So I pulled out my little PDA , and I said , " Okay , let 's look up my appointments for September 12th . " 
I had September 12th -- from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. , I paid my storage bill . 
From 10:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. , I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time . 
From 12:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. , I taught my intro class , 3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. , I taught my advanced class . 
" Where were you the 11th ? " " Where were you the 10th ? " 
" Where were you the 29th ? the 30th ? " 
" Where were you October 5th ? " 
We read about six months of my calendar . 
And I do n't think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did . 
But good thing I did , because I do n't look good in orange . 
So he asked me -- " So this storage unit that you paid the rent on , what did you have in it ? " 
This was in Tampa , Florida , so I was like , " Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida . 
Furniture that I ca n't fit in my ratty apartment . 
Just assorted garage sale junk , because I 'm a pack rat . " 
And he looks at me really confused and says , " No explosives ? " 
I was like , " No , no . I 'm pretty certain there were no explosives . 
And if there were , I would have remembered that one . " 
And he 's still a little confused , but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I 'm not exactly a terrorist threat . 
And so we 're sitting there , and eventually after about an hour , hour and a half of just going back and forth , he says , " Okay , I have enough information here . 
I 'm going to pass this onto the Tampa office . They 're the ones who initiated this . 
They 'll follow up with you , and we 'll take care of it . " 
I was like , " Great . " 
So I got home and the phone rings , and a man introduced himself . 
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth , not six months continuously . 
By the way , you folks know that in the United States , you ca n't take photographs of federal buildings , but Google can do it for you . 
So to the folks from Google , thank you . 
So I spent a lot of time in this building . 
Questions like : " Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation ? " 
And you also have to consider the state of mind you 're in when you 're doing this . 
You 're basically face - to - face with someone that essentially decides life or death . 
Or questions such as -- actually , during the polygraph , which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was ... 
well the first one was , " Is your name Hasan ? " " Yes . " 
" Are we in Florida ? " " Yes . " " Is today Tuesday ? " " Yes . " 
Because you have to base it on a yes or no . 
Then , of course , the next question is : " Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States ? " 
I work at a university . 
So I was like , " Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly . " 
But they said , " Okay , aside from what we had discussed , do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States ? " 
I was like , " No . " 
So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs , they said , " Hey , everything 's fine . " 
I was like , " I know . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you guys all along . 
I know everything 's fine . " 
So they 're looking at me really odd . 
And it 's like , " Guys , I travel a lot . " 
This is with the FBI . 
And I was like , " All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo , and here we go all over again . " 
And there was a sincere concern there . 
And he was like , " You know , if you get into trouble , give us a call -- we 'll take care of it . " 
So ever since then , before I would go anywhere , I would call the FBI . 
I would tell them , " Hey guys , this is where I 'm going . This is my flight . 
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th " or whatever . 
A couple weeks later , I 'd call again , let them know . 
It was n't that I had to , but I chose to . 
Just wanted to say , " Hey guys . 
Do n't want to make it look like I 'm making any sudden moves . " 
" I do n't want you guys to think that I 'm about to flee . 
Just letting you know . Heads up . " 
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over . 
And then the phone calls turned into emails , and the emails got longer and longer and longer ... 
with pictures , with travel tips . 
Then I 'd make websites . 
And then I built this over here . Let me go back to it over here . 
So I actually designed this back in 2003 . 
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment . 
I wrote some code for my mobile phone . 
Basically , what I decided is okay guys , you want to watch me , that 's cool . 
But I 'll watch myself . It 's okay . 
You do n't have to waste your energy or your resources . 
And I 'll help you out . 
So in the process , I start thinking , well what else might they know about me ? 
Well they probably have all my flight records , so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online . 
So you can see , Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta . 
And then you see , these are some of the meals that I 've been fed on the planes . 
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco . 
See that ? They wo n't let me on a plane with that , but they 'll give it to me on the plane . 
These are the airports that I hang out in , because I like airports . 
That 's Kennedy airport , May 19th , Tuesday . 
This is in Warsaw . 
Singapore . You can see , they 're kind of empty . 
These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone . 
But if you can cross - reference this with the other data , then you 're basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together . 
And when you 're in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence , you 're put in the situation where you react in a very different manner . 
At the time that this was going on , the last thing on my mind was " art project . " 
I was certainly not thinking , hey , I got new work here . 
But after going through this , after realizing , well what just happened ? 
And after piecing together this , this and this , this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this , and it actually became this project . 
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know . 
This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch 99 in Daly City on Sunday , November 15th . 
At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi . 
And I bought some crabs too right around there , and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville . 
And laundry too . Laundry detergent at West Oakland -- East Oakland , sorry . 
And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick . 
Now if you go to my bank records , it 'll actually show something from there , so you know that , on May 9th , that I bought $ 14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo . 
So not only that I 'm giving this information here and there , but now there 's a third party , an independent third party , my bank , that 's verifying that , yes indeed , I was there at this time . 
So there 's points , and these points are actually being cross - referenced . 
And there 's a verification taking place . 
Sometimes they 're really small purchases . 
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee . 
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts , and everything pops up right away . 
Sometimes there 's a lot of information . 
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was . 
And then sometimes you get this . 
Sometimes you just get this , just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City , January 22nd . 
And I can tell you exactly who I was with , where I was , because this is what I had to do with the FBI . 
I had to tell them every little detail of everything . 
I spend a lot of time on the road . 
This is a parking lot in Elko , Nevada off of Route 80 at 8:01 p.m. on August 19th . 
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations . 
So there 's multiple databases . 
And there 's thousands and thousands and thousands of images . 
There 's actually 46,000 images right now on my site , and the FBI has seen all of them -- at least I trust they 've seen all of them . 
And then sometimes you do n't get much information at all , you just get this empty bed . 
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information . 
So you get something like this . 
This , by the way , is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California -- Vietnamese sandwich . 
So there 's different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations , empty gas stations . 
These are some of the meals that I 've been cooking at home . 
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home ? 
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times . 
So again , you have to do some detective work here . 
So sometimes the databases get so specific . 
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth . 
At 11:39 a.m. was this one . 
At 1:56 p.m. was this one . At 4:59 p.m. was this one . 
So I time - stamp my life every few moments . 
Every few moments I shoot the image . 
Now it 's all done on my iPhone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together . 
They need to know where I 'm doing my business , because they want to know about my business . 
So on December 4th , I went here . 
And on Sunday , June 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o'clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan , Maine -- this was my apartment there . 
So what you 're basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information . 
If you go to my site , there 's tons of things . 
And really , it 's not the most user - friendly interface . 
It 's actually quite user - unfriendly . 
And one of the reasons , also being part of the user - unfriendliness , is that everything is there , but you have to really work through it . 
So by me putting all this information out there , what I 'm basically telling you is I 'm telling you everything . 
But in this barrage of noise that I 'm putting out , I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life . 
And you know very little about me actually . 
And really so I 've come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy , particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded , there 's no need to delete information anymore . 
So what do you do when everything is out there ? 
Well you have to take control over it . 
And if I give you this information directly , it 's a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces . 
The other thing that 's also interesting that 's going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it does n't matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information , or restricted access to information . 
And the reason their information has any value is , well , because no one else has access to it . 
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you , the information that the FBI has has no value , so thus devaluing their currency . 
And I understand that , on an individual level , it 's purely symbolic . 
But if 300 million people in the U.S. 
started doing this , we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up . 
Because it just would n't work if everybody was sharing everything . 
And we 're getting to that . 
When I first started this project , people were looking at me and saying , " Why would you want to tell everybody what you 're doing , where you 're at ? 
Why are you posting these photos ? " 
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people . 
So in a way , I 'm glad that I 'm completely obsolete . 
I 'm still doing this project , but it is obsolete , because you 're all doing it . 
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis , whether we 're aware of it or not . 
So we 're creating our own archives and so on . 
And you know , some of my friends have always said , " Hey , you 're just paranoid . Why are you doing this ? 
Because no one 's really watching . 
No one 's really going to bother you . " 
So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully . 
Because it 's about surveillance . 
I 'm watching who 's watching me . 
And I came up with these . 
So these are some of my sample logs . 
And just little bits and pieces , and you can see some of the things there . 
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see . 
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security . 
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by . 
I actually moved very close to them . I live right down the street from them now . 
Central Intelligence Agency . 
Executive Office of the President . 
Not really sure why they show up , but they do . 
I think they kind of like to look at art . 
And I 'm glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields . 
So thank you very much . I appreciate it . 
Bruno Giussani : Hasan , just curious . 
You said , " Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone , " but actually you do take the pictures and put on information . 
So how many hours of the day does that take ? 
HE : Almost none . 
It 's no different than sending a text . 
It 's no different than checking an email . 
It 's one of those things , we got by just fine before we had to do any of those . 
So it 's just become another day . 
I mean , when we update a status message , we do n't really think about how long that 's going to take . 
So it 's really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks , send , and then it 's done . 
And everything 's automated at the other end . 
BG : On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage , the FBI gets crazy ? 
HE : Well it goes to the last point that I was at . 
So it holds onto the very last point . 
So if I 'm on a 12-hour flight , you 'll see the last airport that I departed from . 
BG : Hasan , thank you very much .

We feel instinctively that societies with huge income gaps are somehow going wrong . Richard Wilkinson charts the hard data on economic inequality , and shows what gets worse when rich and poor are too far apart : real effects on health , lifespan , even such basic values as trust .

Richard Wilkinson : How economic inequality harms societies 
You all know the truth of what I 'm going to say . 
I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution . 
What 's changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can compare societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequality does . 
I 'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I 'm going to be showing you exist . 
But first , see what a miserable lot we are . 
I want to start though with a paradox . 
This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average . 
And you see the countries on the right , like Norway and the USA , are twice as rich as Israel , Greece , Portugal on the left . 
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all . 
There 's no suggestion of a relationship there . 
But if we look within our societies , there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society . 
This , again , is life expectancy . 
These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right , the richest on the left . 
A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us . 
Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top . 
So income means something very important within our societies , and nothing between them . 
The explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we 're looking at relative income or social position , social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us . 
And as soon as you 've got that idea , you should immediately wonder : what happens if we widen the differences , or compress them , make the income differences bigger or smaller ? 
And that 's what I 'm going to show you . 
I 'm not using any hypothetical data . 
I 'm taking data from the U.N. -- it 's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies . 
The measure we 've used , because it 's easy to understand and you can download it , is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country . 
And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan , Finland , Norway , Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half , four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent . 
But on the more unequal end -- U.K. , Portugal , USA , Singapore -- the differences are twice as big . 
On that measure , we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies . 
Now I 'm going to show you what that does to our societies . 
We collected data on problems with social gradients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder . 
Internationally comparable data on life expectancy , on kids ' maths and literacy scores , on infant mortality rates , homicide rates , proportion of the population in prison , teenage birthrates , levels of trust , obesity , mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility . 
We put them all in one index . 
They 're all weighted equally . 
Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things . 
And there , you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I 've just shown you , which I shall use over and over again in the data . 
The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems . 
It 's an extraordinarily close correlation . 
But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita , gross national income , there 's nothing there , no correlation anymore . 
We were a little bit worried that people might think we 'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence , so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well - being . 
It has 40 different components put together by other people . 
It contains whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have books at home , what immunization rates are like , whether there 's bullying at school . 
Everything goes into it . 
Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality . 
Kids do worse in the more unequal societies . 
Highly significant relationship . 
But once again , if you look at that measure of child well - being , in relation to national income per person , there 's no relationship , no suggestion of a relationship . 
What all the data I 've shown you so far says is the same thing . 
The average well - being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth . 
That 's very important in poorer countries , but not in the rich developed world . 
But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much . 
I 'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index . 
Here , for instance , is trust . 
It 's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted . 
It comes from the World Values Survey . 
You see , at the more unequal end , it 's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others . 
But in the more equal societies , it rises to 60 or 65 percent . 
And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital , very similar relationships closely related to inequality . 
I may say , we did all this work twice . 
We did it first on these rich , developed countries , and then as a separate test bed , we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question : do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures ? 
So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality . 
Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust . 
Same thing is going on . 
Basically we found that almost anything that 's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed . 
We 're not just talking about a fluke . 
This is mental illness . 
WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society . 
This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year . 
And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others . 
And again , closely related to inequality . 
This is violence . 
These red dots are American states , and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces . 
But look at the scale of the differences . 
It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150 . 
This is the proportion of the population in prison . 
There 's a about a tenfold difference there , log scale up the side . 
But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison . 
That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime . 
In some places , that 's part of it . 
But most of it is about more punitive sentencing , harsher sentencing . 
And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty . 
Here we have children dropping out of high school . 
Again , quite big differences . 
Extraordinarily damaging , if you 're talking about using the talents of the population . 
This is social mobility . 
It 's actually a measure of mobility based on income . 
Basically , it 's asking : do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons , or is there no relationship between the two ? 
And at the more unequal end , fathers ' income is much more important -- in the U.K. , USA . 
And in Scandinavian countries , fathers ' income is much less important . 
There 's more social mobility . 
And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream , they should go to Denmark . 
I 've shown you just a few things in italics here . 
I could have shown a number of other problems . 
They 're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient . 
But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse , but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common . 
Think of the expense , the human cost of that . 
I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points . 
One is that , in graph after graph , we find the countries that do worse , whatever the outcome , seem to be the more unequal ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan . 
So what we 're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality . 
It 's not just one or two things that go wrong , it 's most things . 
The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that , if you look at the bottom , Sweden and Japan , they 're very different countries in all sorts of ways . 
The position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world . 
But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality . 
Sweden has huge differences in earnings , and it narrows the gap through taxation , general welfare state , generous benefits and so on . 
Japan is rather different though . 
It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax . 
It has lower taxes . 
It has a smaller welfare state . 
And in our analysis of the American states , we find rather the same contrast . 
There are some states that do well through redistribution , some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax . 
So we conclude that it does n't much matter how you get your greater equality , as long as you get there somehow . 
I am not talking about perfect equality , I 'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies . 
Another really surprising part of this picture is that it 's not just the poor who are affected by inequality . 
There seems to be some truth in John Donne 's " No man is an island . " 
And in a number of studies , it 's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy . 
This is just one example . 
It 's infant mortality . 
Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification . 
And so it 's anachronistically a classification by fathers ' occupations , so single parents go on their own . 
But then where it says " low social class , " that 's unskilled manual occupations . 
It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle , then the junior non - manual , going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors , lawyers , directors of larger companies . 
You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy . 
The biggest differences are at the bottom of society . 
But even at the top , there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society . 
We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally . 
And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom , but has some benefits even at the top . 
But I should say a few words about what 's going on . 
I think I 'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality . 
More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority , of being valued and devalued , respected and disrespected . 
And of course , those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society . 
It also leads to status insecurity . 
We worry more about how we 're judged and seen by others , whether we 're regarded as attractive , clever , all that kind of thing . 
The social - evaluative judgments increase , the fear of those social - evaluative judgments . 
Interestingly , some parallel work going on in social psychology : some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones , their responses to doing stressful tasks , measured . 
And in the review , what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol , the central stress hormone . 
And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social - evaluative threat -- threats to self - esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance . 
Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress . 
Now we have been criticized . 
Of course , there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising . 
I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data , we never pick and choose data . 
We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we 're looking at , it goes into the analysis . 
Our data source decides whether it 's reliable data , we do n't . 
Otherwise that would introduce bias . 
What about other countries ? 
There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer - reviewed journals . 
This is n't confined to these countries here , hiding a very simple demonstration . 
The same countries , the same measure of inequality , one problem after another . 
Why do n't we control for other factors ? 
Well we 've shown you that GNP per capita does n't make any difference . 
And of course , others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on . 
What about causality ? 
Correlation in itself does n't prove causality . 
We spend a good bit of time . 
And indeed , people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes . 
The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system , the cardiovascular system . 
Or for instance , the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on . 
I should say that to deal with this , we 've got to deal with the post - tax things and the pre - tax things . 
We 've got to constrain income , the bonus culture incomes at the top . 
I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can . 
I think the take - home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us . 
Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well - being of whole societies , and that 's exciting . 
Thank you .

Jeff Smith spent a year in prison . But what he discovered inside was n’t what he expected -- he saw in his fellow inmates boundless ingenuity and business savvy . He asks : Why do n't we tap this entrepreneurial potential to help ex - prisoners contribute to society once they 're back outside ? 
business , prison 
1624 
Jeff Smith : Lessons in business … from prison 
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future . 
He had a vision . When he got out , he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision . 
He 'd spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars . 
It was my first week in federal prison , and I was learning quickly that it was n't what you see on TV . 
In fact , it was teeming with smart , ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate . 
Now , 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside , but when they talked about what they did , they talked about it in a different jargon , but the business concepts that they talked about were n't unlike those that you 'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton : promotional incentives , you never charge a first - time user , focus - grouping new product launches , territorial expansion . 
But they did n't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days . 
For the most part , everyone was just trying to survive . 
It 's a lot harder than you might think . 
Contrary to what most people think , people do n't pay , taxpayers do n't pay , for your life when you 're in prison . You 've got to pay for your own life . 
You 've got to pay for your soap , your deodorant , toothbrush , toothpaste , all of it . 
And it 's hard for a couple of reasons . 
First , everything 's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you 'd pay on the street , and second , you do n't make a lot of money . 
I unloaded trucks . That was my full - time job , unloading trucks at a food warehouse , for $ 5.25 , not an hour , but per month . 
So how do you survive ? 
Well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles . 
There 's legal hustles . 
You pay everything in stamps . Those are the currency . 
You charge another inmate to clean his cell . 
There 's sort of illegal hustles , like you run a barbershop out of your cell . 
There 's pretty illegal hustles : You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell . 
And there 's very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there 's a risk - reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be . 
You want a cigarette in prison ? Three to five dollars . 
You want an old - fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head ? Three hundred bucks . 
You want a dirty magazine ? 
Well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars . 
So as you can probably tell , one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity . 
Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse , sculpting people 's hair with toenail clippers , or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs , prisoners learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they 've learned to the outside and start restaurants , barber shops , personal training businesses . 
But there 's no training , nothing to prepare them for that , no rehabilitation at all in prison , no one to help them write a business plan , figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises , no access to the Internet , even . 
And then , when they come out , most states do n't even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background . 
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex - offenders re - offend within five years . 
Look , I lied to the Feds . I lost a year of my life from it . 
But when I came out , I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with did n't have to waste any more of their life than they already had . 
So I hope that you 'll think about helping in some way . 
The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons , because if we do n't , they 're not going to learn any new skills that 's going to help them , and they 'll be right back . 
All they 'll learn on the inside is new hustles . 
Thank you . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/don_norman_on_design_and_emotion.html 
In this talk from 2003 , design critic Don Norman turns his incisive eye toward beauty , fun , pleasure and emotion , as he looks at design that makes people happy . He names the three emotional cues that a well - designed product must hit to succeed . 
creativity , design , happiness 
480 
Don Norman on 3 ways good design makes you happy 
The new me is beauty . 
Yeah , people used to say , " Norman 's OK , but if you followed what he said , everything would be usable but it would be ugly . " 
Well , I did n't have that in mind , so ... 
This is neat . 
Thank you for setting up my display . 
I mean , it 's just wonderful . 
And I have n't the slightest idea of what it does or what it 's good for , but I want it . 
And that 's my new life . 
My new life is trying to understand what beauty is about , and " pretty , " and " emotions . " 
The new me is all about making things kind of neat and fun . 
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer , produced by Alessi . 
It 's just neat ; it 's fun . It 's so much fun I have it in my house -- but I have it in the entryway , I do n't use it to make juice . 
In fact , I bought the gold - plated special edition and it comes with a little slip of paper that says , " Do n't use this juicer to make juice . " 
The acid will ruin the gold plating . 
So actually , I took a carton of orange juice and I poured it in the glass to take this picture . 
Beneath it is a wonderful knife . 
It 's a Global cutting knife made in Japan . 
First of all , look at the shape -- it 's just wonderful to look at . 
Second of all , it 's really beautifully balanced : it holds well , it feels well . 
And third of all , it 's so sharp , it just cuts . 
It 's a delight to use . 
And so it 's got everything , right ? 
It 's beautiful and it 's functional . 
And I can tell you stories about it , which makes it reflective , and so you 'll see I have a theory of emotion . 
And those are the three components . 
Hiroshi Ishii and his group at the MIT Media Lab took a ping - pong table and placed a projector above it , and on the ping - pong table they projected an image of water with fish swimming in it . 
And as you play ping - pong , whenever the ball hits part of the table , the ripples spread out and the fish run away . 
But of course , then the ball hits the other side , the ripples hit the -- poor fish , they ca n't find any peace and quiet . 
Is that a good way to play ping - pong ? 
No . But is it fun ? 
Yeah ! Yeah . 
Or look at Google . 
If you type in , oh say , " emotion and design , " you get 10 pages of results . 
So Google just took their logo and they spread it out . 
Instead of saying , " You got 73,000 results . 
This is one through 20 . Next , " they just give you as many o 's as there are pages . 
It 's really simple and subtle . 
I bet a lot of you have seen it and never noticed it . 
That 's the subconscious mind that sort of notices it -- it probably is kind of pleasant and you did n't know why . 
And it 's just clever . 
And of course , what 's especially good is , if you type " design and emotion , " the first response out of those 10 pages is my website . 
Now , the weird thing is Google lies , because if I type " design and emotion , " it says , " You do n't need the ' and . ' We do it anyway . " 
So , OK . 
So I type " design emotion " and my website was n't first again . 
It was third . 
Oh well , different story . 
There was this wonderful review in The New York Times about the MINI Cooper automobile . 
It said , " You know , this is a car that has lots of faults . 
Buy it anyway . 
It 's so much fun to drive . " 
And if you look at the inside of the car -- I mean , I loved it , I wanted to see it , I rented it , this is me taking a picture while my son is driving -- and the inside of the car , the whole design is fun . 
It 's round , it 's neat . 
The controls work wonderfully . 
So that 's my new life ; it 's all about fun . 
I really have the feeling that pleasant things work better , and that never made any sense to me until I finally figured out -- look ... 
I 'm going to put a plank on the ground . 
So , imagine I have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long and I 'm going to walk on it , and you see I can walk on it without looking , I can go back and forth and I can jump up and down . 
No problem . 
Now I 'm going to put the plank 300 feet in the air -- and I 'm not going to go near it , thank you . 
Intense fear paralyzes you . 
It actually affects the way the brain works . 
So , Paul Saffo , before his talk said that he did n't really have it down until just a few days or hours before the talk , and that anxiety was really helpful in causing him to focus . 
That 's what fear and anxiety does ; it causes you to be -- what 's called depth - first processing -- to focus , not be distracted . 
And I could n't force myself across that . 
Now some people can -- circus workers , steel workers . 
But it really changes the way you think . 
And then , a psychologist , Alice Isen , did this wonderful experiment . 
She brought students in to solve problems . 
So , she 'd bring people into the room , and there 'd be a string hanging down here and a string hanging down here . 
It was an empty room , except for a table with a bunch of crap on it -- some papers and scissors and stuff . 
And she 'd bring them in , and she 'd say , " This is an IQ test and it determines how well you do in life . 
Would you tie those two strings together ? " 
So they 'd take one string and they 'd pull it over here and they could n't reach the other string . 
Still ca n't reach it . 
And , basically , none of them could solve it . 
You bring in a second group of people , and you say , " Oh , before we start , I got this box of candy , and I do n't eat candy . 
Would you like the box of candy ? " 
And turns out they liked it , and it made them happy -- not very happy , but a little bit of happy . 
And guess what -- they solved the problem . 
And it turns out that when you 're anxious you squirt neural transmitters in the brain , which focuses you makes you depth - first . 
And when you 're happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes , which makes you a breadth - first problem solver : you 're more susceptible to interruption ; you do out - of - the - box thinking . 
That 's what brainstorming is about , right ? 
With brainstorming we make you happy , we play games , and we say , " No criticism , " and you get all these weird , neat ideas . 
But in fact , if that 's how you always were you 'd never get any work done because you 'd be working along and say , " Oh , I got a new way of doing it . " 
So to get work done , you 've got to set a deadline , right ? 
You 've got be anxious . 
The brain works differently if you 're happy . Things work better because you 're more creative . 
You get a little problem , you say , " Ah , I 'll figure it out . " 
No big deal . 
There 's something I call the visceral level of processing , and there will be visceral - level design . 
Biology -- we have co - adapted through biology to like bright colors . 
That 's especially good that mammals and primates like fruits and bright plants , because you eat the fruit and you thereby spread the seed . 
There 's an amazing amount of stuff that 's built into the brain . 
We dislike bitter tastes , we dislike loud sounds , we dislike hot temperatures , cold temperatures . 
We dislike scolding voices . We dislike frowning faces ; we like symmetrical faces , etc . , etc . 
So that 's the visceral level . 
In design , you can express visceral in lots of ways , like the choice of type fonts and the red for hot , exciting . 
Or the 1963 Jaguar : It 's actually a crummy car , falls apart all the time , but the owners love it . 
And it 's beautiful -- it 's in the Museum of Modern Art . 
A water bottle : You buy it because of the bottle , not because of the water . 
And when people are finished , they do n't throw it away . 
They keep it for -- you know , it 's like the old wine bottles , you keep it for decoration or maybe fill it with water again , which proves it 's not the water . 
It 's all about the visceral experience . 
The middle level of processing is the behavioral level and that 's actually where most of our stuff gets done . 
Visceral is subconscious , you 're unaware of it . 
Behavioral is subconscious , you 're unaware of it . 
Almost everything we do is subconscious . 
I 'm walking around the stage -- I 'm not attending to the control of my legs . 
I 'm doing a lot ; most of my talk is subconscious ; it has been rehearsed and thought about a lot . 
Most of what we do is subconscious . 
Automatic behavior -- skilled behavior -- is subconscious , controlled by the behavioral side . 
And behavioral design is all about feeling in control , which includes usability , understanding -- but also the feel and heft . 
That 's why the Global knives are so neat . 
They 're so nicely balanced , so sharp , that you really feel you 're in control of the cutting . 
Or , just driving a high - performance sports car over a demanding curb -- again , feeling that you are in complete control of the environment . 
Or the sensual feeling . 
This is a Kohler shower , a waterfall shower , and actually , all those knobs beneath are also showerheads . 
It will squirt you all around and you can stay in that shower for hours -- and not waste water , by the way , because it recirculates the same dirty water . 
Or this -- this is a really neat teapot I found at high tea at The Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago . 
It 's a Ronnefeldt tilting teapot . 
That 's kind of what the teapot looks like but the way you use it is you lay it on its back , and you put tea in , and then you fill it with water . 
The water then seeps over the tea . 
And the tea is sitting in this stuff to the right -- the tea is to the right of this line . 
There 's a little ledge inside , so the tea is sitting there and the water is filling it up like that . 
And when the tea is ready , or almost ready , you tilt it . 
And that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing . 
And when it 's finished , you put it vertically , and now the tea is -- you remember -- above this line and the water only comes to here -- and so it keeps the tea out . 
On top of that , it communicates , which is what emotion does . 
Emotion is all about acting ; emotion is really about acting . 
It 's being safe in the world . 
Cognition is about understanding the world , emotion is about interpreting it -- saying good , bad , safe , dangerous , and getting us ready to act , which is why the muscles tense or relax . 
And that 's why we can tell the emotion of somebody else -- because their muscles are acting , subconsciously , except that we 've evolved to make the facial muscles really rich with emotion . 
Well , this has emotions if you like , because it signals the waiter that , " Hey , I 'm finished . See -- upright . " 
And the waiter can come by and say , " Would you like more water ? " 
It 's kind of neat . What a wonderful design . 
And the third level is reflective , which is , if you like the superego , it 's a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- does n't see the senses , does n't control the muscles . 
It looks over what 's going on . 
It 's that little voice in your head that 's watching and saying , " That 's good . That 's bad . " 
Or , " Why are you doing that ? I do n't understand . " 
It 's that little voice in your head that 's the seat of consciousness . 
Here 's a great reflective product . 
Owners of the Hummer have said , " You know I 've owned many cars in my life -- all sorts of exotic cars , but never have I had a car that attracted so much attention . " 
It 's about attention . It 's about their image , not about the car . 
If you want a more positive model -- this is the GM car . 
And the reason you might buy it now is because you care about the environment . 
And you 'll buy it to protect the environment , even though the first few cars are going to be really expensive and not perfected . 
But that 's reflective design as well . 
Or an expensive watch , so you can impress people -- " Oh gee , I did n't know you had that watch . " 
As opposed to this one , which is a pure behavioral watch , which probably keeps better time than the $ 13,000 watch I just showed you . 
But it 's ugly . 
This is a clear Don Norman watch . 
And what 's neat is sometimes you pit one emotion against the other , the visceral fear of falling against the reflective state saying , " It 's OK . It 's OK . It 's safe . It 's safe . " 
If that amusement park were rusty and falling apart , you 'd never go on the ride . 
So , it 's pitting one against the other . 
The other neat thing ... 
So Jake Cress is this furniture maker , and he makes this unbelievable set of furniture . 
And this is his chair with claw , and the poor little chair has lost its ball and it 's trying to get it back before anybody notices . 
And what 's so neat about it is how you accept that story . 
And that 's what 's nice about emotion . 
So that 's the new me . 
I 'm only saying positive things from now on .

Speaking at LIFT 2007 , Sugata Mitra talks about his Hole in the Wall project . Young kids in this project figured out how to use a PC on their own -- and then taught other kids . He asks , what else can children teach themselves ?

Sugata Mitra shows how kids teach themselves 
I have a tough job to do . 
You know , when I looked at the profile of the audience here , with their connotations and design , in all its forms , and with so much and so many people working on collaborative and networks , and so on , that I wanted to tell you , I wanted to build an argument for primary education in a very specific context . 
In order to do that in 20 minutes , I have to bring out four ideas -- it 's like four pieces of a puzzle . 
And if I succeed in doing that , maybe you would go back with the thought that you could build on , and perhaps help me do my work . 
The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness and the quality of education . 
Now , by remoteness , I mean two or three different kinds of things . 
Of course , remoteness in its normal sense , which means that as you go further and further away from an urban center , you get to remoter areas . 
What happens to education ? 
The second , or a different kind of remoteness is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world , you have pockets , like slums , or shantytowns , or poorer areas , which are socially and economically remote from the rest of the city , so it 's us and them . 
What happens to education in that context ? 
So keep both of those ideas of remoteness . 
We made a guess . The guess was that schools in remote areas do not have good enough teachers . 
If they do have , they can not retain those teachers . 
They do not have good enough infrastructure . 
And if they had some infrastructure , they have difficulty maintaining it . 
But I wanted to check if this is true . So what I did last year was we hired a car , looked up on Google , found a route into northern India from New Delhi which , you know , which did not cross any big cities or any big metropolitan centers . Drove out about 300 kilometers , and wherever we found a school , administered a set of standard tests , and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph . 
The graph was interesting , although you need to consider it carefully . 
I mean , this is a very small sample ; you should not generalize from it . 
But it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular route that I had taken , the remoter the school was , the worse its results seemed to be . 
That seemed a little damning , and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure , or with the availability of electricity , and things like that . 
To my surprise , it did not correlate . 
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms . 
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure . 
It did not correlate with the poverty levels . It did not correlate . 
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire to each of these schools , with one single question for the teachers -- which was , " Would you like to move to an urban , metropolitan area ? " -- 69 percent of them said yes . And as you can see from that , they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi , and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi -- because , you know , those are relatively better off areas -- and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi , the answer is consistently yes . 
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class every day thinking that , I wish I was in some other school , probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results . 
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools , as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat , and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms and that sort of thing . It appears that way . 
When you take education and technology , then I find in the literature that , you know , things like websites , collaborative environments -- you 've been listening to all that in the morning -- it 's always piloted first in the best schools , the best urban schools , and , according to me , biases the result . 
The literature -- one part of it , the scientific literature -- consistently blames ET as being over - hyped and under - performing . 
The teachers always say , well , it 's fine , but it 's too expensive for what it does . 
Because it 's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting , let 's say , 80 percent of whatever they could do . 
You put in this new super - duper technology , and now they get 83 percent . 
So the principal looks at it and says , 3 percent for 300,000 dollars ? Forget it . 
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools , where the score was 30 percent , and , let 's say , took that up to 40 percent -- that will be a completely different thing . 
So the relative change that ET , Educational Technology , would make , would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top , but we seem to be doing it the other way about . 
So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach the underprivileged first , not the other way about . 
And finally came the question of , how do you tackle teacher perception ? 
Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology , the teacher 's first reaction is , you can not replace a teacher with a machine -- it 's impossible . 
I do n't know why it 's impossible , but , even for a moment , if you did assume that it 's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke , the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo , and he said something which completely solves this problem . 
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine , should be . 
So , you know , it puts the teacher into a tough bind , you have to think . 
Anyway , so I 'm proposing that an alternative primary education , whatever alternative you want , is required where schools do n't exist , where schools are not good enough , where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough , for whatever reason . 
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies , then you do n't need an alternative education . 
So far I have n't come across such an area , except for one case . I wo n't name the area , but somewhere in the world people said , we do n't have this problem , because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools . 
There are such areas , but -- anyway , I 'd never heard that anywhere else . 
I 'm going to talk about children and self - organization , and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea of what might an alternative education be like . 
They 're called the hole - in - the - wall experiments . 
I 'll have to really rush through this . They 're a set of experiments . 
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999 . 
And what we did over there was pretty much simple . 
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum , an urban slum , so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum . 
They cut a hole inside that wall -- which is how it has got the name hole - in - the - wall -- and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole , sort of embedded into the wall so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end , a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall , put it on high - speed Internet , put the Internet Explorer there , put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there . 
And this is what we saw . 
So that was my office in IIT . Here 's the hole - in - the - wall . 
About eight hours later , we found this kid . 
To the right is this eight - year - old child who -- and to his left is a six - year - old girl , who is not very tall . 
And what he was doing was , he was teaching her to browse . 
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered . 
Is this real ? Does the language matter , because he 's not supposed to know English ? 
Will the computer last , or will they break it and steal it -- and did anyone teach them ? 
The last question is what everybody said , but you know , I mean , they must have poked their head over the wall and asked the people in your office , can you show me how to do it , and then somebody taught him . 
So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it , this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India , where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything . 
So it was a warm day , and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building . This is the first kid who came there ; he later on turned out to be a 13-year - old school dropout . 
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad . 
Very quickly , he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me , " I have never seen a television where you can do something . " 
So he figured that out . It took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television . 
And then , as he was doing that , he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you 'll see him do that . 
He did that , and the Internet Explorer changed page . 
Eight minutes later , he looked from his hand to the screen , and he was browsing : he was going back and forth . 
When that happened , he started calling all the neighborhood children , like , children would come and see what 's happening over here . 
And by the evening of that day , 70 children were all browsing . 
So eight minutes and an embedded computer seemed to be all that we needed there . 
So we thought that this is what was happening : that children in groups can self - instruct themselves to use a computer and the Internet . But under what circumstances ? 
At this time there was a -- the main question was about English . 
People said , you know , you really ought to have this in Indian languages . 
So I said , have what , shall I translate the Internet into some Indian language ? That 's not possible . 
So , it has to be the other way about . 
But let 's see , how do the children tackle the English language ? 
I took the experiment out to northeastern India , to a village called Madantusi , where , for some reason , there was no English teacher , so the children had not learned English at all . 
And I built a similar hole - in - the - wall . 
One big difference in the villages , as opposed to the urban slums : there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk . 
In the urban slums , the girls tend to stay away . 
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I did n't have any Internet -- and came back three months later . 
So when I came back there , I found these two kids , eight- and 12-year - olds , who were playing a game on the computer . 
And as soon as they saw me they said , " We need a faster processor and a better mouse . " 
I was real surprised . 
You know , how on earth did they know all this ? 
And they said , " Well , we 've picked it up from the CDs . " 
So I said , " But how did you understand what 's going on over there ? " 
So they said , " Well , you 've left this machine which talks only in English , so we had to learn English . " 
So then I measured , and they were using 200 English words with each other -- mispronounced , but correct usage -- words like exit , stop , find , save , that kind of thing , not only to do with the computer but in their day - to - day conversations . 
So , Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier ; in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language if they really wanted to . 
Finally , I got some funding to try this experiment out to see if these results are replicable , if they happen everywhere else . 
India is a good place to do such an experiment in , because we have all the ethnic diversities , all the -- you know , the genetic diversity , all the racial diversities , and also all the socio - economic diversities . 
So , I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section that would cover practically the whole world . 
So I did this for almost five years , and this experiment really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India . 
This is the Himalayas . Up in the north , very cold . 
I also had to check or invent an engineering design which would survive outdoors , and I was using regular , normal PCs , so I needed different climates , for which India is also great , because we have very cold , very hot , and so on . 
This is the desert to the west . Near the Pakistan border . 
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages -- the first thing that these children did was to find a website to teach themselves the English alphabet . 
Then to central India -- very warm , moist , fishing villages , where humidity is a very big killer of electronics . 
So we had to solve all the problems we had without air conditioning and with very poor power , so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running . 
I want to just cut this short . We did this over and over again . 
This sequence is also nice . This is a small child , a six - year - old , telling his eldest sister what to do . 
And this happens very often with these computers , that the younger children are found teaching the older ones . 
What did we find ? We found that six- to 13-year - olds can self - instruct in a connected environment , irrespective of anything that we could measure . 
So if they have access to the computer , they will teach themselves , including intelligence . 
I could n't find a single correlation with anything , but it had to be in groups . 
And that may be of great , you know , interest to this group , because all of you are talking about groups . 
So here was the power of what a group of children can do , if you lift the adult intervention . 
Just a quick idea of the measurements . 
We took standard statistical techniques , so I 'm going to not talk about that . 
But we got a clean learning curve , almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school . 
I 'll leave it at that , because , I mean , it sort of says it all , does n't it ? 
What could they learn to do ? 
Basic Windows functions , browsing , painting , chatting and email , games and educational material , music downloads , playing video . 
In short , what all of us do . 
And over 300 children will become computer literate and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer . 
So , how do they do that ? 
If you calculated the actual time of access , it would work out to minutes per day , so that 's not how it 's happening . 
What you have , actually , is there is one child operating the computer . 
And surrounding him are usually three other children , who are advising him on what they should do . 
If you test them , all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them . 
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children , who are also advising , usually wrongly , about everything that 's going on on the computer . 
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject . 
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing . 
It seems counter - intuitive to adult learning , but remember , eight - year - olds live in a society where most of the time they are told , do n't do this , you know , do n't touch the whiskey bottle . 
So what does the eight - year - old do ? 
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched . 
And if you tested him , he would answer every question correctly on that topic . 
So , they seem to be able to acquire very quickly . 
So what was the conclusion over the six years of work ? 
It was that primary education can happen on its own , or parts of it can happen on its own . 
It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards . 
It could perhaps be a self - organizing system , so that was the second bit that I wanted to tell you , that children can self - organize and attain an educational objective . 
The third piece was on values , and again , to put it very briefly , I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India , and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different values - oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions . 
We got all sorts of opinions . Yes , no or I do n't know . 
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes -- so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements . 
These were areas where the children were clearly confused , because half said yes and half said no . 
A typical example being , " Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies . " 
They do n't have a way to determine which way to answer this question ; perhaps none of us do . 
So I leave you with this third question . 
Can technology alter the acquisition of values ? 
Finally , self - organizing systems , about which , again , I wo n't say too much because you 've been hearing all about it . 
Natural systems are all self - organizing : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except for the debate about an intelligent designer . 
But at this point in time , as far as science goes , it 's self - organization . 
But other examples are traffic jams , stock market , society and disaster recovery , terrorism and insurgency . 
And you know about the Internet - based self - organizing systems . 
So here are my four sentences then . 
Remoteness affects the quality of education . 
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first , and other areas later . 
Values are acquired ; doctrine and dogma are imposed -- the two opposing mechanisms . 
And learning is most likely a self - organizing system . 
If you put all the four together , then it gives -- according to me -- it gives us a goal , a vision , for educational technology . 
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital , automatic , fault - tolerant , minimally invasive , connected and self - organized . 
As educationists , we have never asked for technology ; we keep borrowing it . 
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology , but it was not meant for education , it was meant for making boardroom presentations . 
We borrowed it . Video conferencing . The personal computer itself . 
I think it 's time that the educationists made their own specs , and I have such a set of specs . This is a brief look at that . 
And such a set of specs should produce the technology to address remoteness , values and violence . 
So I thought I 'd give it a name -- why do n't we call it " outdoctrination . " 
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future ? 
So I want to leave that as a thought with you . 
Thank you .

After 15 years in the British diplomatic corps , Carne Ross became a " freelance diplomat , " running a bold nonprofit that gives small , developing and yet - unrecognized nations a voice in international relations . At the BIF-5 conference , he calls for a new kind of diplomacy that gives voice to small countries , that works with changing boundaries and that welcomes innovation .

Carne Ross : An independent diplomat 
My story is a little bit about war . 
It 's about disillusionment . 
It 's about death . 
And it 's about rediscovering idealism in all of that wreckage . 
And perhaps also , there 's a lesson about how to deal with our screwed - up , fragmenting and dangerous world of the 21st century . 
I do n't believe in straightforward narratives . 
I do n't believe in a life or history written as decision " A " led to consequence " B " led to consequence " C " -- these neat narratives that we 're presented with , and that perhaps we encourage in each other . 
I believe in randomness , and one of the reasons I believe that is because me becoming a diplomat was random . 
I 'm colorblind . 
I was born unable to see most colors . 
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time , and I have to take my wife with me to chose clothes . 
And I 'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy . 
I loved watching planes barrel over our holiday home in the countryside . 
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot . 
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot , and sure enough , I failed . 
I could n't see all the blinking different lights , and I ca n't distinguish color . 
So I had to choose another career , and this was in fact relatively easy for me , because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood , which was international relations . 
As a child , I read the newspaper thoroughly . 
I was fascinated by the Cold War , by the INF negotiations over intermediate - range nuclear missiles , the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S. 
in Angola or Afghanistan . 
These things really interested me . 
And so I decided quite at an early age I wanted to be a diplomat . 
And I , one day , I announced this to my parents -- and my father denies this story to this day -- I said , " Daddy , I want to be a diplomat . " 
And he turned to me , and he said , " Carne , you have to be very clever to be a diplomat . " 
And my ambition was sealed . 
In 1989 , I entered the British Foreign Service . 
That year , 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat , and 20 of us succeeded . 
And as those numbers suggest , I was inducted into an elite and fascinating and exhilarating world . 
Being a diplomat , then and now , is an incredible job , and I loved every minute of it -- I enjoyed the status of it . 
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather - soled shoes and reveled in this amazing access I had to world events . 
I traveled to the Gaza Strip . 
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section in the British Foreign Ministry . 
I became a speechwriter for the British Foreign Secretary . 
I met Yasser Arafat . 
I negotiated with Saddam 's diplomats at the U.N. 
Later , I traveled to Kabul and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban . 
And I would travel in a C-130 transport and go and visit warlords in mountain hideaways and negotiate with them about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan , surrounded by my Special Forces escort , who , themselves , had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines , because it was so dangerous . 
And that was exciting -- that was fun . 
It was really interesting . 
And it 's a great cadre of people , incredibly close - knit community of people . 
And the pinnacle of my career , as it turned out , was when I was posted to New York . 
I 'd already served in Germany , Norway , various other places , but I was posted to New York to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation . 
And my responsibility was the Middle East , which was my specialty . 
And there , I dealt with things like the Middle East peace process , the Lockerbie issue -- we can talk about that later , if you wish -- but above all , my responsibility was Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction and the sanctions we placed on Iraq to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons . 
I was the chief British negotiator on the subject , and I was steeped in the issue . 
And anyway , my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time . 
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy . 
We went through several wars during my time in New York . 
I negotiated for my country the resolution in the Security Council of the 12th of September 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before , which were , of course , deeply present to us actually living in New York at the time . 
So it was kind of the best of time , worst of times kind of experience . 
I lived the high - life . 
Although I worked very long hours , I lived in a penthouse in Union Square . 
I was a single British diplomat in New York City ; you can imagine what that might have meant . 
I had a good time . 
But in 2002 , when my tour came to an end , I decided I was n't going to go back to the job that was waiting for me in London . 
I decided to take a sabbatical , in fact , at the New School , Bruce . 
In some inchoate , inarticulate way I realized that there was something wrong with my work , with me . 
I was exhausted , and I was also disillusioned in a way I could n't quite put my finger on . 
And I decided to take some time out from work . 
The Foreign Office was very generous . 
You could take these special unpaid leave , as they called them , and yet remain part of the diplomatic service , but not actually do any work . 
It was nice . 
And eventually , I decided to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo , which was then under U.N. administration . 
And two things happened in Kosovo , which kind of , again , shows the randomness of life , because these things turned out to be two of the pivots of my life and helped to deliver me to the next stage . 
But they were random things . 
One was that , in the summer of 2004 , the British government , somewhat reluctantly , decided to have an official inquiry into the use of intelligence on WMD in the run up to the Iraq War , a very limited subject . 
And I testified to that inquiry in secret . 
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq and its WMD , and my testimony to the inquiry said three things : that the government exaggerated the intelligence , which was very clear in all the years I 'd read it . 
And indeed , our own internal assessment was very clear that Iraq 's WMD did not pose a threat to its neighbors , let alone to us . 
Secondly , the government had ignored all available alternatives to war , which in some ways was a more discreditable thing still . 
The third reason , I wo n't go into . 
But anyway , I gave that testimony , and that presented me with a crisis . 
What was I going to do ? 
This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues , of my ministers , who had , in my view had perpetrated a war on a falsehood . 
And so I was in crisis . 
And this was n't a pretty thing . 
I moaned about it , I hesitated , I went on and on and on to my long - suffering wife , and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service . 
I felt -- there 's a scene in the Al Pacino movie " The Insider , " which you may know , where he goes back to CBS after they 've let him down over the tobacco guy , and he goes , " You know , I just ca n't do this anymore . Something 's broken . " 
And it was like that for me . I love that movie . 
I felt just something 's broken . 
I ca n't actually sit with my foreign minister or my prime minister again with a smile on my face and do what I used to do gladly for them . 
So took a running leap and jumped over the edge of a cliff . 
And it was a very , very uncomfortable , unpleasant feeling . 
And I started to fall . 
And today , that fall has n't stopped ; I 'm still falling . 
But , in a way , I 've got used to the sensation of it . 
And in a way , I kind of like the sensation of it a lot better than I like actually standing on top of the cliff , wondering what to do . 
A second thing happened in Kosovo , which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water , forgive me . 
A second thing happened in Kosovo , which kind of delivered the answer , which I could n't really answer , which is , " What do I do with my life ? " 
I love diplomacy -- I have no career -- I expected my entire life to be a diplomat , to be serving my country . 
I wanted to be an ambassador , and my mentors , my heroes , people who got to the top of my profession , and here I was throwing it all away . 
A lot of my friends were still in it . 
My pension was in it . 
And I gave it up . 
And what was I going to do ? 
And that year , in Kosovo , this terrible , terrible thing happened , which I saw . 
In March 2004 , there were terrible riots all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo . 
18 people were killed . 
It was anarchy . 
And it 's a very horrible thing to see anarchy , to know that the police and the military -- there were lots of military troops there -- actually ca n't stop that rampaging mob who 's coming down the street . 
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop is when they decide to stop and when they 've had enough burning and killing . 
And that is not a very nice feeling to see , and I saw it . 
And I went through it . I went through those mobs . 
And with my Albanian friends , we tried to stop it , but we failed . 
And that riot taught me something , which is n't immediately obvious and it 's kind of a complicated story . 
But one of the reasons that riot took place -- those riots , which went on for several days , took place -- was because the Kosovo people were disenfranchised from their own future . 
There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo going on then , and the Kosovo government , let alone the Kosovo people , were not actually participating in those talks . 
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system , this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo , and the Kosovars were n't part of it . 
And funnily enough , they were frustrated about that . 
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration . 
It was n't the only reason , and life is not simple , one reason narratives . 
It was a complicated thing , and I 'm not pretending it was more simple than it was . 
But that was one of the reasons . 
And that kind of gave me the inspiration -- or rather to be precise , it gave my wife the inspiration . 
She said , " Why do n't you advise the Kosovars ? 
Why do n't you advise their government on their diplomacy ? " 
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service . 
They were not allowed diplomats . 
They were not allowed a foreign office to help them deal with this immensely complicated process , which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo . 
And so that was the idea . 
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat , the world 's first diplomatic advisory group and a non - profit to boot . 
And it began when I flew back from London after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo . 
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him , " Look , I 'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy . 
I know this stuff . It 's what I do . Why do n't I come and help you ? " 
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said , " Yes , Carne . Come . " 
And I came to Kosovo and advised the Kosovo government . 
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers and the multi - party negotiation team of Kosovo . 
And Kosovo became independent . 
Independent Diplomat is now established in five diplomatic centers around the world , and we 're advising seven or eight different countries , or political groups , depending on how you wish to define them -- and I 'm not big on definitions . 
We 're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island . 
We 're advising the Burmese opposition , the government of Southern Sudan , which -- you heard it here first -- is going to be a new country within the next few years . 
We 're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara , who are fighting to get their country back from Moroccan occupation after 34 years of dispossession . 
We 're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations , which is suppose to culminate in Copenhagen . 
There 's a bit of randomness here too because , when I was beginning Independent Diplomat , I went to a party in the House of Lords , which is a ridiculous place , but I was holding my drink like this , and I bumped into this guy who was standing behind me . 
And we started talking , and he said -- I told him what I was doing , and I told him rather grandly I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York . 
At that time there was just me -- and me and my wife were moving back to New York . 
And he said , " Why do n't you see my colleagues in New York ? " 
And it turned out he worked for an innovation company called ? What If ! , which some of you have probably heard of . 
And one thing led to another , and I ended up having a desk in ? What If ! in New York , when I started Independent Diplomat . 
And watching ? What If ! 
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley or new flavors for Coke actually helped me innovate new strategies for the Kosovars and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara . 
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy -- that diplomacy , like business , is a business of solving problems , and yet the word innovation does n't exist in diplomacy ; it 's all zero sum games and realpolitik and ancient institutions that have been there for generations and do things the same way they 've always done things . 
And Independent Diplomat , today , tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ? What If ! . 
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office . 
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think . 
And we use naive experts who may know nothing about the countries we 're dealing with , but may know something about something else to try to inject new thinking into the problems that we try to address for our clients . 
It 's not easy , because our clients , by definition , are having a difficult time , diplomatically . 
There are , I do n't know , some lessons from all of this , personal and political -- and in a way , they 're the same thing . 
The personal one is falling off a cliff is actually a good thing , and I recommend it . 
And it 's a good thing to do at least once in your life just to tear everything up and jump . 
The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today . 
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend which is emerging and evident across the world , which is that the world is fragmenting . 
States mean less than they used to , and the power of the state is declining . 
That means the power of others things is rising . 
Those other things are called non - state actors . 
They may be corporations , they may be mafiosi , they may be nice NGOs , they may anything , any number of things . 
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world . 
If governments are less able to affect the problems that affect us in the world , then that means , who is left to deal with them , who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them ? 
Us . 
If they ca n't do it , who 's left to deal with it ? 
We have no choice but to embrace that reality . 
What this means is it 's no longer good enough to say that international relations , or global affairs , or chaos in Somalia , or what 's going on in Burma is none of your business , and that you can leave it to governments to get on with . 
I can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the Al - Shabaab militia in Somalia . 
Ask me how later , particularly if you eat fish , interestingly enough , but that connection is there . 
We are all intimately connected . 
And this is n't just Tom Friedman , it 's actually provable in case after case after case . 
What that means is , instead of asking your politicians to do things , you have to look to yourself to do things . 
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this in a sort of loose way . 
There are n't neat examples , but one example is this : the way the world is changing is embodied in what 's going on at the place I used to work -- the U.N. Security Council . 
The U.N. was established in 1945 . 
Its charter is basically designed to stop conflicts between states -- interstate conflict . 
Today , 80 percent of the agenda of the U.N. Security Council is about conflicts within states , involving non - state parties -- guerillas , separatists , terrorists , if you want to call them that , people who are not normal governments , who are not normal states . 
That is the state of the world today . 
When I realized this , and when I look back on my time at the Security Council and what happened with the Kosovars , and I realize that often the people who were most directly affected by what we were doing in the Security Council were n't actually there , were n't actually invited to give their views to the Security Council , I thought , this is wrong . 
Something 's got to be done about this . 
So I started off in a traditional mode . 
Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat went around the U.N. Security Council . 
We went around 70 U.N. member states -- the Kazaks , the Ethiopians , the Israelis -- you name them , we went to see them -- the secretary general , all of them , and said , " This is all wrong . 
This is terrible that you do n't consult these people who are actually affected . 
You 've got to institutionalize a system where you actually invite the Kosovars to come and tell you what they think . 
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think . 
It 'll be great . You can have an exchange . 
You can actually incorporate these people 's views into your decisions , which means your decisions will be more effective and durable . " 
Super - logical , you would think . 
I mean , incredibly logical . So obvious , anybody could get it . 
And of course , everybody got it . Everybody went , " Yes , of course , you 're absolutely right . 
Come back to us in maybe six months . " 
And of course , nothing happened -- nobody did anything . 
The Security Council does its business in exactly the same way today that it did X number of years ago , when I was there 10 years ago . 
So we looked at that observation of basically failure and thought , what can we do about it . 
And I thought , I 'm buggered if I 'm going to spend the rest of my life lobbying for these crummy governments to do what needs to be done . 
So what we 're going to do is we 're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves . 
So now , Independent Diplomat is in the process of setting up meetings between the U.N. Security Council and the parties to the disputes that are on the agenda of the Security Council . 
So we will be bringing Darfuri rebel groups , the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots , rebels from Aceh , and awful long laundry list of chaotic conflicts around the world . 
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York to sit down in a quiet room in a private setting with no press and actually explain what they want to the members of the U. N. Security Council , and for the members of the U.N. Security Council to explain to them what they want . 
So there 's actually a conversation , which has never before happened . 
And of course , describing all this , any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult , and I entirely agree with you . 
The chances of failure are very high , but it certainly wo n't happen if we do n't try to make it happen . 
And my politics has changed fundamentally from when I was a diplomat to what I am today , and I think that outputs is what matters , not process , not technology , frankly , so much either . 
Preach technology to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations who are now in political prison in Tehran , where Ahmadinejad remains in power . 
Technology has not delivered political change in Iran . 
You 've got to look at the outputs , and you got to say to yourself , " What can I do to produce that particular output ? " 
That is the politics of the 21st century , and in a way , Independent Diplomat embodies that fragmentation , that change , that is happening to all of us . 
That 's my story . Thanks .

High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about a lesson plan on bacteria -- and devastated when his students hated it . The problem was the textbook : it was impossible to understand . He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision , and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations .

1655 
Tyler DeWitt : Hey science teachers -- make it fun 
Let me tell you a story . 
It 's my first year as a new high school science teacher , and I 'm so eager . 
I 'm so excited , I 'm pouring myself into my lesson plans . 
But I 'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything . 
This happens one day : I 'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology : viruses and how they attack . 
And so I 'm so excited to discuss this with them , and I come in and I say , " Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool ? " 
There 's silence . 
Finally , my favorite student , she looks me straight in the eye , and she says , " The reading sucked . " 
And then she clarified . She said , " You know what , I do n't mean that it sucks . It means that I did n't understand a word of it . 
It 's boring . Um , who cares , and it sucks . " 
These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now , and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat , that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook , but not one of them really understood the main ideas . 
Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool , why it 's so important . 
I 'm totally clueless . 
I have no idea what to do next . 
So the only thing I can think of is say , " Listen . Let me tell you a story . 
The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses . 
These guys are blown up a couple million times . 
The real bacteria and viruses are so small we ca n't see them without a microscope , and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick . 
But what a lot of people do n't know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick . " 
Now , the story that I start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story . 
Once upon a time there 's this happy little bacterium . 
Do n't get too attached to him . 
Maybe he 's floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere , and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good . 
Maybe he ate something bad for lunch , and then things get really horrible , as his skin rips apart , and he sees a virus coming out from his insides . 
And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides . 
If -- Ouch is right ! -- If you see this , and you 're a bacterium , this is like your worst nightmare . 
But if you 're a virus and you see this , you cross those little legs of yours and you think , " We rock . " 
Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium . 
Here 's what had to happen . 
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it . 
The next thing is , that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA . 
And now that we 've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA , the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses . 
Because , you see , DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make . 
So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots . 
The workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they 're following different instructions . 
So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is , until it 's so filled with viruses that it bursts . 
But that 's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria . 
Some are much more crafty . 
When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium , they do a little espionage . 
Here , this cloaked , secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell , but here 's the kicker : It does n't do anything harmful -- not at first . 
Instead , it silently slips into the bacteria 's own DNA , and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell , waiting for instructions . 
And what 's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies , the babies also have the virus DNA in them . 
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family , filled with virus sleeper cells . 
They 're just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM ! -- all of the DNA pops out . 
It takes control of these cells , turns them into virus - making factories , and they all burst , a huge , extended bacteria family , all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts , the viruses taking over the bacterium . 
So now you understand how viruses can attack cells . 
There are two ways : On the left is what we call the lytic way , where the viruses go right in and take over the cells . 
On the [ right ] is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses . 
So this stuff is not that hard , right ? 
And now all of you understand it . 
But if you 've graduated from high school , I can almost guarantee you 've seen this information before . 
But I bet it was presented in a way that it did n't exactly stick in your mind . 
So when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ? 
Well , there were a couple of reasons . 
First of all , I can guarantee you that their textbooks did n't have secret agent viruses , and they did n't have horror stories . 
You know , in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness . 
It kills me . I 'm not kidding . 
I used to work for an educational publisher , and as a writer , I was always told never to use stories or fun , engaging language , because then my work might not be viewed as " serious " and " scientific . " 
Right ? I mean , because God forbid somebody have fun when they 're learning science . 
So we have this field of science that 's all about slime , and color changes . Check this out . 
And then we have , of course , as any good scientist has to have , explosions ! 
But if a textbook seems too much fun , it 's somehow unscientific . 
Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible . 
If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier , we could start by saying something like , " These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium . " 
The way this showed up in the textbook , it looked like this : " Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium . " 
That 's great , perfect for 13-year - olds . 
But here 's the thing . There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there 's no way that we could ever give that to students , because it contains some language that is n't completely accurate . 
For example , I told you that viruses have DNA . 
Well , a very tiny fraction of them do n't . 
They have something called RNA instead . 
So a professional science writer would circle that and say , " That has to go . 
We have to change it to something much more technical . " 
And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation , they 'd find fault with almost every word I 've used , and they 'd have to change anything that was n't serious enough , and they 'd have to change everything that was n't 100 percent perfect . 
Then it would be accurate , but it would be completely impossible to understand . 
This is horrifying . 
You know , I keep talking about this idea of telling a story , and it 's like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision , where you ca n't just tell a story . 
It 's like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know , who gives us all the details nobody cares about , where you 're like , " Oh , I met my friend for lunch the other day , and she was wearing these ugly jeans . 
I mean , they were n't really jeans , they were more kind of , like , leggings , but , like , I guess they 're actually kind of more like jeggings , like , but I think — " and you 're just like , " Oh my God . 
What is the point ? " 
Or even worse , science education is becoming like that guy who always says , " Actually . " 
Right ? You want to be like , " Oh , dude , we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness . " 
And that guy 's like , " Actually , it was 87.3 miles . " 
And you 're like , " Actually , shut up ! 
I 'm just trying to tell a story . " 
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection . 
We have to convince our audience that what we 're talking about matters . 
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across . 
I 'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said , and I paraphrase , when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth . 
I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education . 
Now , finally , I am often so disappointed when people think that I 'm advocating a dumbing down of science . 
That 's not true at all . 
I 'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT , and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed , specific scientific communication between experts , but not when we 're trying to teach 13-year - olds . 
If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA , that 's not going to ruin their chances of success in science . 
But if a young learner ca n't understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this , that will ruin their chances of success . 
This needs to stop , and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems , and I beg them , I beseech them to just stop it . 
But I think that 's unlikely . 
So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet , where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up . 
There 's a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple , understandable ways . 
I dream of a Wikipedia - like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand . 
And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube . 
I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances , and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp . 
The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it 's often written in LOLcats , but nonetheless it 's so appreciative , so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science . 
There 's still so much work left to be done , though , and if you 're involved with science in any way I urge you to join me . 
Pick up a camera , start to write a blog , whatever , but leave out the seriousness , leave out the jargon . 
Make me laugh . Make me care . 
Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point . 
How should you start ? 
Why do n't you say , " Listen , let me tell you a story " ? 
Thank you .

TV executive Lauren Zalaznick thinks deeply about pop television . Sharing results of a bold study that tracks attitudes against TV ratings over five decades , she makes a case that television reflects who we truly are -- in ways we might not have expected . 
culture , entertainment 
1224 
Lauren Zalaznick : The conscience of television 
I want to say that really and truly , after these incredible speeches and ideas that are being spread , I am in the awkward position of being here to talk to you today about television . 
So most everyone watches TV . 
We like it . We like some parts of it . 
Here in America , people actually love TV . 
The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day . 
Okay ? 
Now I happen to make my living these days in television , so for me , that 's a good thing . 
But a lot of people do n't love it so much . 
They , in fact , berate it . 
They call it stupid , and worse , believe me . 
My mother , growing up , she called it the " idiot box . " 
But my idea today is not to debate whether there 's such a thing as good TV or bad TV ; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience . 
So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral , political , social and emotional need states of our nation -- that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system . 
So all these things are uniquely human , and they all add up to our idea of conscience . 
Now today , we 're not talking about good and bad TV . 
We 're talking about popular TV . 
We 're talking about top-10 Nielsen - rated shows over the course of 50 years . 
How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you 've heard about , which is the idea of our social , collective unconscious , but how do these top-10 Nielsen - rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience ? 
How does television evolve over time , and what does this say about our society ? 
Now speaking of evolution , from basic biology , you probably remember that the animal kingdom , including humans , have four basic primal instincts . 
You have hunger ; you have sex ; you have power ; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness . 
As humans , what 's important to remember is that we 've developed , we 've evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts . 
We have the capacity to laugh and cry . 
We feel awe , we feel pity . 
That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom . 
The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained . 
We love to watch TV . 
This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom . 
Animals might love to play , but they do n't love to watch . 
So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious . 
Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ? 
I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders . 
Is television literally functioning as our conscience , tempting us and rewarding us at the same time ? 
So to begin to answer these questions , we did a research study . 
We went back 50 years to the 1959/1960 television season . 
We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows . 
We talked to over 3,000 individuals -- almost 3,600 -- aged 18 to 70 , and we asked them how they felt emotionally . 
How did you feel watching every single one of these shows ? 
Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity ? 
Did you feel outrage ? Did you laugh ? 
What did this mean for you ? 
So to our global TED audiences , I want to say that this was a U.S. sample . 
But as you can see , these emotional need states are truly universal . 
And on a factual basis , over 80 percent of the U.S. 's most popular shows are exported around the world . 
So I really hope our global audiences can relate . 
Two acknowledgments before our first data slide : For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis , I thank legendary rabbi , Jack Stern . 
And for the way in which I 'm going to present the data , I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling , who you may have just seen . 
Okay , here we go . 
So here you see , from 1960 to 2010 , the 50 years of our study . 
Two things we 're going to start with -- the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state , which , for this purpose , we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me , that make me feel much more positive about the world . 
Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I do n't understand the difference between right and wrong . 
As we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady . 
That 's what we 're watching TV for . 
Moral ambiguity starts to climb . 
Right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wane . 
Why ? 
The Cuban Missile Crisis , JFK is shot , the Civil Rights movement , race riots , the Vietnam War , MLK is shot , Bobby Kennedy is shot , Watergate . 
Look what happens . 
In 1970 , inspiration plummets . 
Moral ambiguity takes off . 
They cross , but Ronald Reagan , a telegenic president , is in office . 
It 's trying to recover . 
But look , it ca n't : AIDS , Iran - Contra , the Challenger disaster , Chernobyl . 
Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years . 
Take a look at this . 
This chart is going to document a very similar trend . 
But in this case , we have comfort -- the bubble in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green . 
Now this time on TV you have " Bonanza , " do n't forget , you have " Gunsmoke , " you have " Andy Griffith , " you have domestic shows all about comfort . 
This is rising . Comfort stays whole . 
Irreverence starts to rise . 
Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up . 
You get to 1969 , and look what happens . 
You have comfort , irreverence , and social commentary , not only battling it out in our society , but you literally have two establishment shows -- " Gunsmoke " and " Gomer Pyle " -- in 1969 are the number - two- and number - three - rated television shows . 
What 's number one ? 
The socially irreverent hippie show , " Rowan and Martin 's Laugh - In . " 
They 're all living together , right . 
Viewers had responded dramatically . 
Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show . 
When you guys hear this industry term , a breakout hit , what does that mean ? 
It means in the 1966 television season , The " Smothers Brothers " came out of nowhere . 
This was the first show that allowed viewers to say , " My God , I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War , about the presidency , through television ? " 
That 's what we mean by a breakout show . 
So then , just like the last chart , look what happens . 
In 1970 , the dam bursts . The dam bursts . 
Comfort is no longer why we watch television . 
Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s . 
Now look at this . 
The 70s means who ? Norman Lear . 
You have " All in the Family , " " Sanford and Son , " and the dominant show -- in the top-10 for the entire 70s -- " M*A*S*H. " 
In the entire 50 years of television that we studied , seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War , five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration . 
Only one generation , 20 years in , and we discovered , Wow ! TV can do that ? 
It can make me feel this ? 
It can change us ? 
So to this very , very savvy crowd , I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive . 
Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago . 
This is a quick chart . Here 's another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , " takes me out of my everyday realm " and " makes me feel better . " 
That 's mapped against the red dot , unemployment , which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic . 
You 'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment . 
Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed ? 
No . In the 70s you have the bellwether show " The Bionic Woman " that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973 , followed by the " Six Million - Dollar Man " and " Charlie 's Angels . " 
Another spike in the 1980s -- another spike in shows about control and power . 
What were those shows ? 
Glamorous and rich . 
" Dallas , " " Fantasy Island . " 
Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment . 
So here you are , in my favorite chart , because this is our last 20 years . 
Whether or not you 're in my business , you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three - camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV . 
Well , as we say in the business , X marks the spot . 
The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor -- we 're watching " Friends , " " Frasier , " " Cheers " and " Seinfeld . " 
Everything 's good , low unemployment . 
But look : X marks the spot . 
In 2001 , the September 2001 television season , humor succumbs to judgment once and for all . 
Why not ? 
We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court . 
We had the bursting of the tech bubble . 
We had 9/11 . 
Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon . 
Look what happens when we keep going . 
At the turn of the century , the Internet takes off , reality television has taken hold . 
What do people want in their TV then ? 
I would have thought revenge or nostalgia . 
Give me some comfort ; my world is falling apart . 
No , they want judgment . 
I can vote you off the island . 
I can keep Sarah Palin 's daughter dancing . 
I can choose the next American Idol . You 're fired . 
That 's all great , right ? 
So as dramatically different as these television shows , pure entertainment , have been over the last 50 years -- what did I start with ? -- one basic instinct remains . 
We 're animals , we need our moms . 
There has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant TV mom . 
The 1950s : June Cleever in the original comfort show , " Leave it to Beaver . " 
Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s . 
Maude Findlay , the epitome of the irreverent 1970s , who tackled abortion , divorce , even menopause on TV . 
The 1980s , our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington . 
Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood . 
This era 's mom , Bree Van de Kamp . 
Now I do n't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience , sitting on television 's shoulders , but I do know that I absolutely love this image . 
So to you all , the women of TEDWomen , the men of TEDWomen , the global audiences of TEDWomen , thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television . 
But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television . 
They give it life on television , for sure , but it 's you as viewers , through your collective social consciences , that give it life , longevity , power or not . 
So thanks very much .

Psychologist Jonathan Haidt asks a simple , but difficult question : why do we search for self - transcendence ? Why do we attempt to lose ourselves ? In a tour through the science of evolution by group selection , he proposes a provocative answer . 
culture , evolution , religion 
1389 
Jonathan Haidt : Religion , evolution , and the ecstasy of self - transcendence 
I have a question for you : Are you religious ? 
Please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person . 
Let 's see , I 'd say about three or four percent . 
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference . 
Okay , here 's another question : Do you think of yourself as spiritual in any way , shape or form ? Raise your hand . 
Okay , that 's the majority . 
My Talk today is about the main reason , or one of the main reasons , why most people consider themselves to be spiritual in some way , shape or form . 
My Talk today is about self - transcendence . 
It 's just a basic fact about being human that sometimes the self seems to just melt away . 
And when that happens , the feeling is ecstatic and we reach for metaphors of up and down to explain these feelings . 
We talk about being uplifted or elevated . 
Now it 's really hard to think about anything abstract like this without a good concrete metaphor . 
So here 's the metaphor I 'm offering today . 
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms , most of which we 're very familiar with . 
But sometimes it 's as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase . 
We climb the staircase and experience a state of altered consciousness . 
In 1902 , the great American psychologist William James wrote about the many varieties of religious experience . 
He collected all kinds of case studies . 
He quoted the words of all kinds of people who 'd had a variety of these experiences . 
One of the most exciting to me is this young man , Stephen Bradley , had an encounter , he thought , with Jesus in 1820 . 
And here 's what Bradley said about it . 
Stephen Bradley : I thought I saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room , with arms extended , appearing to say to me , " Come . " 
The next day I rejoiced with trembling . 
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die . 
This world had no place in my affections . 
Previous to this time , I was very selfish and self - righteous . 
But now I desired the welfare of all mankind and could , with a feeling heart , forgive my worst enemies . 
JH : So note how Bradley 's petty , moralistic self just dies on the way up the staircase . 
And on this higher level he becomes loving and forgiving . 
The world 's many religions have found so many ways to help people climb the staircase . 
Some shut down the self using meditation . 
Others use psychedelic drugs . 
This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god . 
Others use dancing , spinning and circling to promote self - transcendence . 
But you do n't need a religion to get you through the staircase . 
Lots of people find self - transcendence in nature . 
Others overcome their self at raves . 
But here 's the weirdest place of all : war . 
So many books about war say the same thing , that nothing brings people together like war . 
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self - transcendent experiences . 
I 'm going to play for you an excerpt from this book by Glenn Gray . 
Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II . 
And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers and wrote about the experience of men in battle . 
Here 's a key passage where he basically describes the staircase . 
Glenn Gray : Many veterans will admit that the experience of communal effort in battle has been the high point of their lives . 
" I " passes insensibly into a " we , " " my " becomes " our " and individual faith loses its central importance . 
I believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self - sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy . 
I may fall , but I do not die , for that which is real in me goes forward and lives on in the comrades for whom I gave up my life . 
JH : So what all of these cases have in common is that the self seems to thin out , or melt away , and it feels good , it feels really good , in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives . 
It feels somehow uplifting . 
This idea that we move up was central in the writing of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim . 
Durkheim even called us Homo duplex , or two - level man . 
The lower level he called the level of the profane . 
Now profane is the opposite of sacred . 
It just means ordinary or common . 
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals . 
We want to satisfy our individual desires . 
We pursue our individual goals . 
But sometimes something happens that triggers a phase change . 
Individuals unite into a team , a movement or a nation , which is far more than the sum of its parts . 
Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred because he believed that the function of religion was to unite people into a group , into a moral community . 
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness . 
And once people circle around some sacred object or value , they 'll then work as a team and fight to defend it . 
Durkheim wrote about a set of intense collective emotions that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum , of making a group out of individuals . 
Think of the collective joy in Britain on the day World War II ended . 
Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square , which brought down a dictator . 
And think of the collective grief in the United States that we all felt , that brought us all together , after 9/11 . 
So let me summarize where we are . 
I 'm saying that the capacity for self - transcendence is just a basic part of being human . 
I 'm offering the metaphor of a staircase in the mind . 
I 'm saying we are Homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred . 
When we climb that staircase , self - interest fades away , we become just much less self - interested , and we feel as though we are better , nobler and somehow uplifted . 
So here 's the million - dollar question for social scientists like me : Is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ? 
Is it a product of natural selection , like our hands ? 
Or is it a bug , a mistake in the system -- this religious stuff is just something that happens when the wires cross in the brain -- Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience , it 's just a mistake ? 
Well many scientists who study religion take this view . 
The New Atheists , for example , argue that religion is a set of memes , sort of parasitic memes , that get inside our minds and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff , self - destructive stuff , like suicide bombing . 
And after all , how could it ever be good for us to lose ourselves ? 
How could it ever be adaptive for any organism to overcome self - interest ? 
Well let me show you . 
In " The Descent of Man , " Charles Darwin wrote a great deal about the evolution of morality -- where did it come from , why do we have it . 
Darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves , but they 're of great use to our groups . 
He wrote about the scenario in which two tribes of early humans would have come in contact and competition . 
He said , " If the one tribe included a great number of courageous , sympathetic and faithful members who are always ready to aid and defend each other , this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other . " 
He went on to say that " Selfish and contentious people will not cohere , and without coherence nothing can be effected . " 
In other words , Charles Darwin believed in group selection . 
Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years , but it 's about to make a major comeback this year , especially after E.O. Wilson 's book comes out in April , making a very strong case that we , and several other species , are products of group selection . 
But really the way to think about this is as multilevel selection . 
So look at it this way : You 've got competition going on within groups and across groups . 
So here 's a group of guys on a college crew team . 
Within this team there 's competition . 
There are guys competing with each other . 
The slowest rowers , the weakest rowers , are going to get cut from the team . 
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport . 
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics . 
So within the team , their interests are actually pitted against each other . 
And sometimes it would be advantageous for one of these guys to try to sabotage the other guys . 
Maybe he 'll badmouth his chief rival to the coach . 
But while that competition is going on within the boat , this competition is going on across boats . 
And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat , now they 've got no choice but to cooperate because they 're all in the same boat . 
They can only win if they all pull together as a team . 
I mean , these things sound trite , but they are deep evolutionary truths . 
The main argument against group selection has always been that , well sure , it would be nice to have a group of cooperators , but as soon as you have a group of cooperators , they 're just going to get taken over by free - riders , individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others . 
Let me illustrate this for you . 
Suppose we 've got a group of little organisms -- they can be bacteria , they can be hamsters ; it does n't matter what -- and let 's suppose that this little group here , they evolved to be cooperative . 
Well that 's great . They graze , they defend each other , they work together , they generate wealth . 
And as you 'll see in this simulation , as they interact they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they 've doubled in size , you 'll see them split , and that 's how they reproduce and the population grows . 
But suppose then that one of them mutates . 
There 's a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy . 
It takes advantage of the others . 
And so when a green interacts with a blue , you 'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller . 
So here 's how things play out . 
We start with just one green , and as it interacts it gains wealth or points or food . 
And in short order , the cooperators are done for . 
The free - riders have taken over . 
If a group can not solve the free - rider problem then it can not reap the benefits of cooperation and group selection can not get started . 
But there are solutions to the free - rider problem . 
It 's not that hard a problem . 
In fact , nature has solved it many , many times . 
And nature 's favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat . 
For example , why is it that the mitochondria in every cell has its own DNA , totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus ? 
It 's because they used to be separate free - living bacteria and they came together and became a superorganism . 
Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another ; we 'll never know exactly why -- but once they got a membrane around them , they were all in the same membrane , now all the wealth - created division of labor , all the greatness created by cooperation , stays locked inside the membrane and we 've got a superorganism . 
And now let 's rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free - riders , of defectors , of cheaters and look what happens . 
A superorganism can basically take what it wants . 
It 's so big and powerful and efficient that it can take resources from the greens , from the defectors , the cheaters . 
And pretty soon the whole population is actually composed of these new superorganisms . 
What I 've shown you here is sometimes called a major transition in evolutionary history . 
Darwin 's laws do n't change , but now there 's a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different . 
Now this transition was not a one - time freak of nature that just happened with some bacteria . 
It happened again about 120 or a 140 million years ago when some solitary wasps began creating little simple , primitive nests , or hives . 
Once several wasps were all together in the same hive , they had no choice but to cooperate , because pretty soon they were locked into competition with other hives . 
And the most cohesive hives won , just as Darwin said . 
These early wasps gave rise to the bees and the ants that have covered the world and changed the biosphere . 
And it happened again , even more spectacularly , in the last half - million years when our own ancestors became cultural creatures , they came together around a hearth or a campfire , they divided labor , they began painting their bodies , they spoke their own dialects , and eventually they worshiped their own gods . 
Once they were all in the same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside . 
And they unlocked the most powerful force ever known on this planet , which is human cooperation -- a force for construction and destruction . 
Of course , human groups are nowhere near as cohesive as beehives . 
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments , but they tend to then break apart . 
We 're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are . 
In fact , often , as we 've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts , often those divisions are along religious lines . 
Nonetheless , when people do come together and put themselves all into the same movement , they can move mountains . 
Look at the people in these photos I 've been showing you . 
Do you think they 're there pursuing their self - interest ? 
Or are they pursuing communal interest , which requires them to lose themselves and become simply a part of a whole ? 
Okay , so that was my Talk delivered in the standard TED way . 
And now I 'm going to give the whole Talk over again in three minutes in a more full - spectrum sort of way . 
Jonathan Haidt : We humans have many varieties of religious experience , as William James explained . 
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves . 
The staircase takes us from the experience of life as profane or ordinary upwards to the experience of life as sacred , or deeply interconnected . 
We are Homo duplex , as Durkheim explained . 
And we are Homo duplex because we evolved by multilevel selection , as Darwin explained . 
I ca n't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug , but if it is an adaptation , then the implications are profound . 
If it is an adaptation , then we evolved to be religious . 
I do n't mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions . 
Those things came along too recently . 
I mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects , people and ideas . 
This is why politics is so tribal . 
Politics is partly profane , it 's partly about self - interest , but politics is also about sacredness . 
It 's about joining with others to pursue moral ideas . 
It 's about the eternal struggle between good and evil , and we all believe we 're on the good team . 
And most importantly , if the staircase is real , it explains the persistent undercurrent of dissatisfaction in modern life . 
Because human beings are , to some extent , hivish creatures like bees . 
We 're bees . We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment . 
We broke down the old institutions and brought liberty to the oppressed . 
We unleashed Earth - changing creativity and generated vast wealth and comfort . 
Nowadays we fly around like individual bees exulting in our freedom . 
But sometimes we wonder : Is this all there is ? 
What should I do with my life ? 
What 's missing ? 
What 's missing is that we are Homo duplex , but modern , secular society was built to satisfy our lower , profane selves . 
It 's really comfortable down here on the lower level . 
Come , have a seat in my home entertainment center . 
One great challenge of modern life is to find the staircase amid all the clutter and then to do something good and noble once you climb to the top . 
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia . 
They all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into . 
They 're all searching for their staircase . 
And that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish . 
Most people long to overcome pettiness and become part of something larger . 
And this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly 400 years ago . 
" No man is an island entire of itself . 
Every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main . " 
JH : Thank you .

Author Sam Martin shares photos of a quirky world hobby that 's trending with the XY set : " manspaces . " Grab a cold one and enjoy . 
architecture , book , culture , design , entertainment , men 
654 
Sam Martin : Claim your " manspace " 
So , I am indeed going to talk about the spaces men create for themselves , but first I want to tell you why I 'm here . 
I 'm here for two reasons . These two guys are my two sons Ford and Wren . 
When Ford was about three years old , we shared a very small room together , in a very small space . 
My office was on one half of the bedroom , and his bedroom was on the other half . 
And you can imagine , if you 're a writer , that things would get really crowded around deadlines . 
So when Wren was on the way , I realized I needed to find a space of my own . 
There was no more space in the house . So I went out to the backyard , and without any previous building experience , and about 3,000 dollars and some recycled materials , I built this space . 
It had everything I needed . It was quiet . 
There was enough space . And I had control , which was very important . 
As I was building this space , I thought to myself , " Surely I 'm not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own . " 
So I did some research . 
And I found that there was an historic precedence . 
Hemingway had his writing space . 
Elvis had two or three manspaces , which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland . 
In the popular culture , Superman had the Fortress of Solitude , and there was , of course , the Batcave . 
So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now . 
Here is one of the first spaces I found . It is in Austin , Texas , which is where I 'm from . 
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage , a nice garage . 
But on the inside , it 's anything but . 
And this , to me , is a pretty classic manspace . 
It has neon concert posters , a bar and , of course , the leg lamp , which is very important . 
I soon realized that manspaces did n't have to be only inside . 
This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard , out of landscaping timbers , astroturf . 
And he found the scoreboard in the trash . 
Here 's another outdoor space , a little bit more sophisticated . 
This a 1923 wooden tugboat , made completely out of Douglas fir . 
The guy did it all himself . 
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging - out space inside . 
So , pretty early on in my investigations I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find , which was , quite frankly , a lot of beer can pyramids and overstuffed couches and flat - screen TVs . 
There were definitely hang - out spots . 
But some were for working , some were for playing , some were for guys to collect their things . 
Most of all , I was just surprised with what I was finding . 
Take this place for example . 
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage . 
This is in Long Island , New York . 
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window . 
On the inside it 's a recreation of a 16th century Japanese tea house . 
The man imported all the materials from Japan , and he hired a Japanese carpenter to build it in the traditional style . 
It has no nails or screws . 
All the joints are hand - carved and hand - scribed . 
Here is another pretty typical scene . This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood . 
But you open one of the garage doors and there is a professional - size boxing ring inside . 
And so there is a good reason for this . 
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough . 
He won the silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympics , and he trains in this space . He trains other people . 
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments , which is another sort of important part about a manspace . 
So , while this space represents someone 's profession , this one certainly represents a passion . 
It 's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship . 
It 's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s . 
Museum quality . 
So , as I came to the end of my journey , I found over 50 spaces . 
And they were unexpected and they were surprising . 
But they were also -- I was really impressed by how personalized they were , and how much work went into them . 
And I realized that 's because the guys that I met were all very passionate about what they did . 
And they really loved their professions . 
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies . 
And so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do , and who they were . 
So if you do n't have a space of your own , I highly recommend finding one , and getting into it . 
Thank you very much .

Great design is a never - ending journey of discovery -- for which it helps to pack a healthy sense of humor . Sociologist and surfer - turned - designer David Carson walks through a gorgeous slide deck of his work and found images .

David Carson on design + discovery 
I had requested slides , kind of adamantly , up till the -- pretty much , last few days , but was denied access to a slide projector . 
I actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal , and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work , unlike PowerPoint and some other programs . 
Now , I agree that you have to -- yeah , there are certain concessions and , you know , if you use a slide projector , you 're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side , or up or down , but maybe that 's an O.K. trade - off , to trade that off for a focus . 
It 's a thought . Just a thought . 
And there 's something nice about slides getting stuck . 
And the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up , which we wo n't see tonight . So . 
With that , let 's get the first slide up here . 
This , as many of you have probably guessed , is a recently emptied beer can in Portugal . 
This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time , and I thought -- you know , fly all night , I looked up , and I thought , wow , how clean . 
You come into this major airport , and they simply have a B. 
I mean , how nice is that ? 
Everything 's gotten simpler in design , and here 's this mega airport , and God , I just -- I took a picture . 
I thought , God , that is the coolest thing I 've ever seen at an airport . 
Till a couple months later , I went back to the same airport -- same plane , I think -- and looked up , and it said C. 
It was only then that I realized it was simply a gate that I was coming into . 
I 'm a big believer in the emotion of design , and the message that 's sent before somebody begins to read , before they get the rest of the information ; what is the emotional response they get to the product , to the story , to the painting -- whatever it is . 
That area of design interests me the most , and I think this for me is a real clear , very simplified version of what I 'm talking about . 
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical , situated next to each other . 
So , here 's the first door . You know , you get the message . 
You know , it 's pretty clear . 
Take a look at the second door and see if there 's any different message . 
O.K. , which one would you park in front of ? 
Same color , same message , same words . 
The only thing that 's different is the expression that the individual door - owner here put into the piece -- and , again , which is the psycho - killer here ? 
Yet it does n't say that ; it does n't need to say that . 
I would probably park in front of the other one . 
I 'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so . 
It 's gotten so simple that it 's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive . 
But I was in Milan and saw this street sign , and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist . 
And this graffiti artist has come along , made this sign a little bit better , and then moved on . 
He did n't overpower it like they have a tendency to do . 
This is for a book by " Metropolis . " 
I took some photos , and this is a billboard in Florida , and either they had n't paid their rent , or they did n't want to pay their rent again on the sign , and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down , so they just teared out sections of it . 
And I would argue that it 's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention , getting you to look over that way . 
And hopefully you do n't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey 's . 
This is from my second book . 
The first book is called , " The End of Print , " and it was done along with a film , working with William Burroughs . 
And " The End of Print " is now in its fifth printing . 
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it , he said no ; he said he did n't believe it was the end of print . 
And I said , well , that 's fine ; I just would love to have your input on this film and this book , and he finally agreed to it . 
And at the end of the film , he says in this great voice that I ca n't mimic but I 'll kind of try , but not really , he says , " I remember attending an exhibition called , ' Photography : The End of Painting . ' " And then he says , " And , of course , it was n't at all . " 
So , apparently when photography was perfected , there were people going around saying , that 's it : you 've just ruined painting . 
People are just going to take pictures now . 
And of course , that was n't the case . 
So , this is from " 2nd Sight , " a book I did on intuition . 
I think it 's not the only ingredient in design , but possibly the most important . 
It 's something everybody has . 
It 's not a matter of teaching it ; in fact , most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they ca n't quantify it : it 's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design , but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter . 
So it tends to get discounted . 
This is a quote from Albert Einstein , who says , " The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery . 
There comes a leap in consciousness -- call it intuition or what you will -- and the solution just comes to you , and you do n't know from where or why . " 
So , it 's kind of like when somebody says , Who did that song ? 
And the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your intuition gives you that answer , in a sense . 
I like this for a couple of reasons . 
If you 've had any design courses , they would teach you you ca n't read this . 
I think you eventually can and , more importantly , I think it 's true . 
" Do n't mistake legibility for communication . " 
Just because something 's legible does n't means it communicates . 
More importantly , it does n't mean it communicates the right thing . 
So , what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material ? 
And I think that 's sometimes an overlooked area . 
This is working with Marshall McLuhan . 
I stayed and worked with his wife and son , Eric , and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times , predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising , television , media world . 
And so this book is called " Probes . " It 's another word for quotes . 
And it 's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before , and basically , I 've interpreted the different quotes . 
So , this was the contents page originally . 
When I got done it was 540 pages , and then the publisher , Gingko Press , ended up cutting it down considerably : it 's just under 400 pages now . 
But I decided I liked this contents page -- I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it . 
It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever , but it 's a nice spread , I think , in there . 
So , a couple spreads from the book : here McLuhan says , " The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature ; they are Nature . " 
" The invention of printing did away with anonymity , fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property , " which had never been done before printing . 
" When new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies , anxieties of all kinds result . " 
" While people are engaged in creating a totally different world , they always form vivid images of the preceding world . " 
I hate this stuff . It 's hard to read . 
" People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe , and no possible occupation except information gathering . " 
That was it . That 's all he saw as the options . And not too far off . 
So , this is a project for Nine Inch Nails . 
And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden , and it was done right after 9/11 . 
And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA that the real estate person had n't pointed out . 
There was some bomb shelter built , apparently in the ' 60s Cuban missile crisis . 
And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by , and he goes , " It 's something to do with the sewage system . " 
I was , O.K. ; that 's fine . 
I finally went down there , and it was this old rusted circular thing , and two beds , and very kind of creepy and weird . 
And also , surprisingly , it was done in kind of a cheap metal , and it had completely rusted through , and water everywhere , and spiders . 
And I thought , you know , what were they thinking ? 
You 'd think maybe cement , possibly , or something . 
But anyway , I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD , and I 've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape , and it 's ready . I think I 'm ready . So . 
This is an experiment , really , for a client , Quicksilver , where we were taking what was a six - shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web . 
So , this is a six - shot sequence . 
I 've taken one shot ; I cropped it a few different ways . 
And then the tiny line of copy says , If you want to see this entire sequence -- how this whole ride was -- go to the website . 
And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture . 
Got no way of tracking it , so I could be totally wrong . 
I do n't have the site . It 's just the piece itself . 
This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke - free Environment -- asked me to do these posters . 
They were wild - posted around New York City . 
You ca n't really -- well , you ca n't see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of payoff , in a sense . 
It says , " If the cigarette companies can lie , then so can we . " But -- -- but I did . 
These were literally wild - posted all over New York one night , and there were definitely some heads turning , you know , people smoking and , " Huh ! " 
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious . 
It was n't some , you know , weird grunge type or something ; it looked like they might be real . Anyway . 
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts , a school in Florida . 
This amazes me . This is a product I just found out . 
I was in the Caribbean at Christmas , and I 'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell -- not that they will sell -- that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin . 
This was either an old product with new packaging , or a brand - new package , and I just thought , Yikes ! How 's that still happening ? 
I do a lot of workshops all over the world , really , and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors . 
I felt this was one of the more successful solutions . 
The students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night , and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ... 
I did some work for Microsoft a few years back . 
It was a worldwide branding campaign . 
And it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology ; I had no design training , and sometimes people say , well , that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there 's no product that I had to sell ; it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve . 
They thought some people did n't like them . 
I found out that 's very true , working on this campaign worldwide . 
And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit , and what I did was add type and people to the ad , which the previous campaign had not had , and nobody remembered them , and nobody referenced them . 
And we were trying to say that , hey , some of these guys that work there are actually OK ; some of them actually have friends and family , and they 're not all awful people . 
And the umbrella campaign was " Thank God it 's Monday . " 
So , we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative : their over - competitiveness , their , you know , long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it . 
You know : Thank God it 's Monday -- I get to go back to that little cubicle , those fake gray walls , and hear everybody else 's conversations f or 10 hours and then go home . 
But anyway , this is one of the ads I was most pleased with , because they were all elaborately art - directed , and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer . 
It says , " Wonder Around . " And then it 's a piece of the software . 
And this is how the ad ran around the world . 
In Germany , they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to , because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference . 
This is how the ad ran throughout the world ; Germany made one slight change in the ad . 
Now , there 's kind of two issues here . 
If you 're going to put a kid in the ad , pick one that looks alive . 
I just have a feeling this kid 's been there for a week , you know . 
He 's just really hoping that boots up and , you know ... 
And then as the agency explained to me , they said , " Look , we do n't have little green people in our country ; why would we put little green people in our ads , for instance ? " 
So , I understand their logic . I totally disagree with it ; I think it 's a very small - minded approach , the world is certainly much more global , and I certainly think the people of Germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer , though we 'll never know . 
This is some work from Ray Gun . 
And the point of this magazine was to read the articles , listen to the music , and try to interpret it . 
There 's no grid , there 's no system , there 's nothing set up in advance . 
This is an opener for Brian Eno , and it 's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music . 
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school . 
There 's a lot of great writing in " Ray Gun . " 
And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books . 
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article -- so I set the whole article in Dingbat . 
You could -- you could highlight it ; you could make it Helvetica or something : it is the actual article . 
I suppose you could eventually decode it , but it 's really not very well written ; it really would n't be worthwhile . 
Having done a lot of magazines , I 'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories , and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11 . 
And I was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we 'd already seen a million times , which was basically the moment of impact . 
And People magazine , I thought , got probably the best shot . 
It 's kind of horsey type , but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting : there was something more enticing , if that 's the right -- it 's not the right word -- but in this cover than Time or Newsweek . 
But when I got into this magazine , there 's something kind of disturbing , and this continued . 
On the left we see people dying ; we see people running for their lives . 
And on the right we learn that there 's a new way to support your breast . 
The coveted right - hand page was not given up to the whole issue . 
Look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she 's going through ? -- and the copy says : " He knows just how to give me goosebumps . " 
Yeah , he jumps out of buildings . It 's -- unfortunately , this one works , kind of , as a spread . 
And this continued through the entire magazine . 
It did not let up . 
This says : " One clean fits all . " . 
There were a lot of orphans made this day , and here 's a dead body being brought out . 
It just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate . 
And this one I think is possibly the worst : two ladies , both facing the same way , both wearing jeans . 
One -- who knows what she 's going through ; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk . 
And -- I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this , and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk , and when they got back to their car , they found a note on their car that made them think maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event -- it had been a few months . 
This was what they found on their car . 
There 's very few times you 'd be happy to find this on your car , but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back . 
This is my desktop . 
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders , but I do n't know what they are . 
These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here . 
We are wrapping up . 
This I saw on the plane , flying in , for hot new products . 
I 'm not sure this is an improvement , or a good idea , because , like , if you do n't spend quite enough time in front of your computer , you can now get a plate in the keyboard , so there 's no more faking it -- that you do n't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway . 
Now there 's a plate , and it would be really , really convenient to get a piece of pizza , then type a little bit , then ... 
I 'm just not sure this is improvement . 
If you ever doubt the power of graphic design , this is a very generic sign that literally says , " Vote for Hitler . " It says nothing else . 
And this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion , of graphic design , even though , in fact , was a very generic poster at the time . 
What 's next ? What 's next is going to be people . 
As we get more technically driven , the importance of people becomes more than it 's ever been before . 
You have to utilize who you are in your work . 
Nobody else can do that : nobody else can pull from your background , from your parents , your upbringing , your whole life experience . 
If you allow that to happen , it 's really the only way you can do some unique work , and you 're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well . 
This is -- I like found art ; hand lettering 's coming back in a big way , and I thought this was a great example of both . 
This lady 's advertising for her lost pit bull . 
It 's friendly -- she 's underlined friendly -- that 's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles . She ca n't spell . 
But more importantly , she 's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull . 
And I 'm thinking , yeah , right , I 'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks . 
I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles , and you get charged by this thing and you go , oh , please be Hercles ; please be the friendly one . 
I 'm sure she never found the dog , because I took the sign . 
But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back . 
And the theme was courage , and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer . 
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father , who was a test pilot , and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot , they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job . 
That 's pretty high for most occupations . 
But , you know , the government would make a plane ; they 'd say , go see if that one flies , would you ? 
Some of them did ; some of them did n't . 
And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make between , like , serif versus san - serif . 
And for the most part , they 're not real life - threatening . 
Why not experiment ? Why not have some fun ? 
Why not put some of yourself into the work ? 
And when I was teaching , I used to always ask the students , What 's the definition of a good job ? 
And as teachers , after you get all the answers , you like to give them the correct answer . 
And the best one I 've heard -- I 'm sure some of you have heard this -- the definition of a good job is : If you could afford to -- if money was n't an issue -- would you be doing that same work ? 
And if you would , you 've got a great job . 
And if you would n't , what the heck are you doing ? 
You 're going to be dead a really long time . 
Thank you very much .

Kevin Kelly on how technology evolves 
I do n't know about you , but I have n't quite figured out exactly what technology means in my life . 
I 've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about . 
Should I be pro - technology ? Should I embrace it full arms ? 
Should I be wary ? Like you , I 'm very tempted by the latest thing . 
But at the other hand , a couple of years ago I gave up all of my possessions , sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle -- and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body , fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food . 
And I 've since then tried to keep technology at arm 's length in many ways , so it does n't master my life . 
At the same time , I run a website on cool tools , where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology . 
So I 'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is as it relates to humanity , as it relates to nature , as it relates to the spiritual . 
And I 'm not even sure we know what technology is . 
And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded . 
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find . 
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829 . 
Before that , obviously , technology did n't exist . But obviously it did . 
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology . 
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born . 
So it sums up a lot of what we 're talking about . 
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that -- he says technology is anything that does n't quite work yet . 
Which also , I think , gets into a little bit of our current idea . 
But I was interested in another definition of technology . 
Something , again , that went back to something more fundamental . 
Something that was deeper . And as I struggled to understand that , I came up with a way of framing the question that seemed to work for me in my investigations . 
And I 'm , this morning , going to talk about this for the first time . 
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud . 
The question that I came up with was this question : what does technology want ? And by that , I do n't mean , does it want chocolate or vanilla ? By what it wants , I mean , what are its inherent trends and biases ? 
What are its tendencies over time ? One way to think about this is thinking about biological organisms , which we 've heard a lot about . 
And the trick that Richard Dawkins does , which is to say , to look at them as simply as genes , as vehicles for genes . 
So he 's saying , what do genes want ? The selfish gene . 
And I 'm applying a similar trick to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ? What does technology want ? 
Obviously , this in an incomplete question , just as looking at an organism as only a gene is an incomplete way of looking at it . 
But it 's still very , very productive . So I 'm attempting to say , if we take technology 's view of the world , what does it want ? 
And I think once we ask that question we have to go back , actually , to life . Because obviously , if we keep extending the origins of technology far back , I think we come back to life at some point . 
So that 's where I want to begin my little exploration , is in life . 
And like you heard from the previous speakers , we do n't really know what life there is on Earth right now . 
We have really no idea . 
Craig Venter 's tremendous and brilliant attempt to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great . 
Brian Farrell 's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth . 
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects , just to see what 's on life . And if we did that with our little Martian probe , which we have not done on Earth , we would begin to see some incredible species . 
This is not on another planet . These are things that are hidden away on our planet . 
This is an ant that stores its colleagues ' honey in its abdomen . 
Each one of these organisms that we 've described -- that you 've seen from Jamie and others , these magnificent things -- what they 're doing , each one of them , is they 're hacking the rules of life . 
I ca n't think of a single general principle of biology that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism . 
Every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard Olivia 's talk about the sexual habits , you 'll realize that there is n't anything we can say that 's true for all life , because every single one of them is hacking something about it . 
This is a solar - powered sea slug . It 's a nudibranch that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy . 
This is another version of that . This is a sea dragon , and the one on the bottom , the blue one , is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid , has not yet taken in the brown - green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy . 
These are hacks , and if we looked at the general shape of the approaches to hacking life there are , current consensus , six kingdoms . Six different broad approaches : the plants , the animals , the fungi , the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria and the Archaea bacteria . The Archaeas . 
Those are the general approaches to life . That 's one way to look at life on Earth today . 
But a more interesting way , the current way to take the long view , is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective . 
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution go over the linear time , we have it coming out from the center . 
So in the center is the most primitive , and this is a genealogical chart of all life on earth . This is all the same six kingdoms . 
You see 4,000 representative species , and you can see where we are . 
But what I like about this is it shows that every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved . 
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans . 
They 've been around just as long and gone through just the same kind of trial and error to get here . 
But we see that each one of these is actually hacking , and has a different way of finding out how to do life . 
And if we take the long - term trends of life , if we begin to say , what does evolution want ? There 's several things that we see . 
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth have we ever been where we do n't find life . 
We find life at the bottom of every long - term , long - distance drilling core into the center of rock that we bring up -- and there 's bacteria in the pores of that rock . 
And wherever life is , it never retreats . It 's ubiquitous and it wants to be more . 
More and more of the inert matter of the globe is being touched and animated by life . 
The second thing is is we see diversity . We also see specialization . 
We see the movement from a general - purpose cell to the more specific and specialized . 
And we see a drift towards complexity that 's very intuitive . 
And actually , we have current data that does show that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time . 
And the last thing , I bring back this nudibranch . 
One of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability . And by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life . 
Like those chloroplast cells -- they 're completely surrounded by other life . 
They never touch the inner matter . There is more and more co - evolution . 
And so the general , long - term trends of evolution are roughly these five : ubiquity , diversity , specialization , complexity and socialization . Now , I took that and said , OK , what are the long - term trends in technology ? 
And again , my question is , what does technology want ? 
And so , remarkably , I discovered that there 's also a drift toward specialization . 
That we see there 's a general hammer , and hammers become more and more specific over time . 
There 's obviously diversity . Huge numbers of things . 
This is all the contents of a Japanese home . 
I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter , and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around and count the number of species of technology in our household . 
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products . 
I did some research and found out that the King of England , Henry VIII , had only about 7,000 items in his household . 
And he was the King of England , and that was the entire wealth of England at the time . 
So we 're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things . 
This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out and he sees machines making machines . How depraved ! 
Well , this is actually what we 're headed towards : world machines . 
And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies . 
Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology and not non - technology , or even life . 
And thirdly , the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche . And I 'm happy to say , I was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological , but that 's pretty evident . 
So the major trends in technology evolution actually are the same as in biological evolution . The same drives that we see towards ubiquity , towards diversity , towards socialization , towards complexity . That is maybe not a big surprise because if we map out , say , the evolution of armor , you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary - type cladistic tree . 
I suggest that , in fact , technology is the seventh kingdom of life . 
That its operations and how it works is so similar that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom . 
And so it would be sort of approximately up there , coming out of the animal kingdom . And if we were to do that , we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way . 
This is Niles Eldredge . He was the co - developer with Stephen Jay Gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium . 
But as a sideline , he happens to collect cornets . 
He has one of the world 's largest collections -- about 500 of them . 
And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites , or snails , and to do a morphological analysis , and try to derive their genealogical history over time . 
This is his chart , which is not quite published yet . 
But the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom , those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made . That does not happen in biology . 
When something is extinct , you ca n't have it as your parent . 
But that does happen in technology . And it turns out that that 's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree , and you can actually use it to determine that this is a technological system versus a biological system . 
In fact , this idea of resurrecting the whole idea is so important that I began to think about what happens with old technology . 
And it turns out that , in fact , technologies do n't die . 
So I suggested this to an historian of science , and he said , " Well , what about , you know , come on , what about steam cars ? 
They 're not around anymore . " Well actually , they are . 
In fact , they 're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile . 
And this is a website of a guy who 's selling brand new parts for the Stanley automobile . And the thing that I liked is sort of this one - click , add - to - your - cart button -- -- for buying steam valves . I mean , it was just -- it was really there . 
And so , I began to think about , well , maybe that 's just a random sample . 
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way . 
So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward 's catalog and I randomly went through it . And I took a page -- not quite a random page -- I took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made . But I took this page and I said , how many of these things are still being made ? 
And not antiques . I want to know how many of these things are still in production . 
And the answer is : all of them . 
All of them are still being produced . So you 've got corn shellers . 
I do n't know who needs a corn sheller . 
Be it corn shellers -- you 've got ploughs ; you 've got fan mills ; all these things -- and these are not , again , antiques . These are -- you can order these . You can go to the web and you can buy them now , brand - new made . So in a certain sense , technologies do n't die . 
In fact , you can buy , for 50 bucks , a stone - age knife made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago . 
It 's short , bone handle , 50 bucks . And in fact , what 's important is that this information actually never died out . 
It 's not just that it was resurrected . It 's continued all along . 
And in Papua New Guinea , they were making stone axes until two decades ago , just as a course of practical matters . 
Even when we try to get rid of a technology , it 's actually very hard . 
So we 've all heard about the Amish giving up cars . 
We 've heard about the Japanese giving up guns . 
We 've heard about this and that . But I actually went back and took what I could find , the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology , and then I tried to find out when they came back in , because they always came back in . And it turns out that the time , the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited , is decreasing over time . And that basically , you can delay technology , but you ca n't kill it . So this makes sense , because in a certain sense what culture is , is the accumulation of ideas . 
That 's what it 's for . It 's so that ideas do n't die out . 
And when we take that , we take this idea of what culture is doing and add it to what the long - term trajectory -- again , in life 's evolution -- we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life -- what they 're really about is accelerating and changing the way in which evolution happens . 
They 're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated . 
So all these steps in evolution are increasing , basically , the evolution of evolvability . 
So what 's happening over time in life is that the ways in which you generate these new ideas , these new hacks , are increasing . And the real tricks are ways in which you kind of explore the way of exploring . 
And then what we see in the singularity , that prophesized by Kurzweil and others -- his idea that technology is accelerating evolution . 
It 's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas . 
So if you have life hacking -- life means hacking , the game of survival -- then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game . 
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve . 
That is what we call an " infinite game . " 
That 's the definition of " infinite game . " A finite game is play to win , and an infinite game is played to keep playing . 
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force . 
The origins of technology was not in 1829 , but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang , and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed . The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot , and it was so tight in there , there was no room for any difference at all . 
That 's the definition . There was no temperature . 
There was no difference whatsoever . And at the Big Bang , what it expanded was the potential for difference . 
So as it expands and as things expand what we have is the potential for differences , diversity , options , choices , opportunities , possibilities and freedoms . 
Those are all basically the same thing . 
And those are the things that technology brings us . 
That 's what technology is bringing us : choices , possibilities , freedoms . 
That 's what it 's about . It 's this expansion of room to make differences . 
And so a hammer , when we grab a hammer , that 's what we 're grabbing . 
And that 's why we continue to grab technology -- because we want those things . Those things are good . 
Differences , freedom , choices , possibilities . 
And each time we make a new opportunity place , we 're allowing a platform to make new ones . 
And I think it 's really important . Because if you can imagine Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented -- what a loss to society there would be . 
Imagine Van Gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints . 
Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film . 
Somewhere , today , there are millions of young children being born whose technology of self - expression has not yet been invented . 
We have a moral obligation to invent technology so that every person on the globe has the potential to realize their true difference . 
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals . 
That 's what technology really wants . 
I 'm going to skip through some of the objections because I do n't have answers to why there 's deforestation . 
I do n't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies . I do n't have an answer to how this impacts on our dignity , other than to suggest that maybe the seventh kingdom , because it 's so close to what life is about , maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life . 
Maybe in some ways the fact that what we 're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it . 
It 's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields , but it 's a really good thing to use to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village . 
Our humanity is actually defined by technology . 
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity is being driven by technology . This is the infinite game . 
That 's what we 're talking about . 
You see , technology is a way to evolve the evolution . 
It 's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more . 
And it 's actually a way of playing the game , of playing all the games . 
That 's what technology wants . 
And so when I think about what technology wants , I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this -- every person here has an assignment . And your assignment is to spend your life discovering what your assignment is . 
That recursive nature is the infinite game . 
And if you play that well , you 'll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you 're gone . 
That is the infinite game . And what technology is is the medium in which we play that infinite game . 
And so I think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are . 
Thank you .

Mike deGruy : Hooked by an octopus 
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age . 
I grew up in Mobile , Alabama -- somebody 's got to be from Mobile , right ? -- and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers , forming this beautiful delta . 
And the delta has alligators crawling in and out of rivers filled with fish and cypress trees dripping with snakes , birds of every flavor . 
It 's an absolute magical wonderland to live in -- if you 're a kid interested in animals , to grow up in . 
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay , and finally into the Gulf of Mexico . 
And I remember my first real contact with octopus was probably at age five or six . 
I was in the gulf , and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom . 
And I reached down and picked him up , and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility . 
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand . 
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature . 
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands and started flashing colors , just pulsing all of these colors . 
And as I looked at it , it kind of tucked its arms under it , raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes . 
I 'm going , " My gosh ! " I had never seen anything like this in my life ! 
So I marveled for a moment , and then decided it was time to release him , so I put him down . 
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing : It landed on the bottom in the rubble and -- fwoosh ! -- vanished right before my eyes . 
And I knew , right then , at age six , that is an animal that I want to learn more about . So I did . 
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology , and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school at the University of Hawaii . 
And while a student at Hawaii , I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium . 
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks but not a lot of invertebrate displays , and being the spineless guy , I thought , well I 'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals I had been learning about as a student and bring them in , and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display . 
Now , the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at , but they did n't really interact with people . 
But the octopus did . 
If you walked up to an octopus tank , especially early in the morning before anyone arrived , the octopus would rise up and look at you and you 're thinking , " Is that guy really looking at me ? He is looking at me ! " 
And you walk up to the front of the tank . Then you realize that these animals all have different personalities : Some of them would hold their ground , others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks , and one in particular , this amazing animal ... 
I went up to the front of the tank , and he 's just staring at me , and he had little horns come up above his eyes . 
So I went right up to the front of the tank -- I was three or four inches from the front glass -- and the octopus was sitting on a perch , a little rock , and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass . 
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away , and at that time I could actually focus that close ; now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone . 
Anyway , there we were , staring at each other , and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank from the filtration system , and -- chk chk chk chk chk ! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down . 
He reaches up , takes another armful of gravel , releases it -- chk chk chk chk chk ! -- same thing . 
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm . 
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm . 
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race , because I was out and he had six left . 
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day was that this octopus was playing , which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate . 
So , about three years into my degree , a funny thing happened on the way to the office , which actually changed the course of my life . 
A man came into the aquarium . It 's a long story , but essentially he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific to collect animals for him , and as we left , he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras . 
He said , " Make a movie about this expedition . " 
" OK , a couple of biologists making a movie -- this'll be interesting , " and off we went . And we did , we made a movie , which had to be the worst movie ever made in the history of movie making , but it was a blast . I had so much fun . 
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head , thinking , " Wait a minute . 
Maybe I can do this all the time . 
Yeah , I 'll be a filmmaker . " 
So I literally came back from that job , quit school , hung my filmmaking shingle and just never told anyone that I did n't know what I was doing . 
It 's been a good ride . 
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial . 
If you 're a wildlife filmmaker and you 're going out into the field to film animals , especially behavior , it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are , how they work and , you know , a bit about their behaviors . 
But where I really learned about octopus was in the field , as a filmmaker making films with them , where you 're allowed to spend large periods of time with the animals , seeing octopus being octopus in their ocean homes . 
I remember I took a trip to Australia , went to an island called One Tree Island . 
And apparently , evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree , between the time they named it and the time I arrived , because I 'm sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there . 
Anyway , one tree is situated right next to a beautiful coral reef . 
In fact , there 's a surge channel where the tide is moving back and forth , twice a day , pretty rapidly . 
And there 's a beautiful reef , very complex reef , with lots of animals , including a lot of octopus . 
And not uniquely but certainly , the octopus in Australia are masters at camouflage . 
As a matter of fact , there 's one right there . 
So our first challenge was to find these things , and that was a challenge , indeed . 
But the idea is , we were there for a month and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them . 
So the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could , every day a little closer , a little closer , a little closer . 
And you knew what the limit was : they would start getting twitchy and you 'd back up , come back in a few hours . 
And after the first week , they ignored us . 
It was like , " I do n't know what that thing is , but he 's no threat to me . " 
So they went on about their business and from a foot away , we 're watching mating and courting and fighting and it is just an unbelievable experience . 
And one of the most fantastic displays that I remember , or at least visually , was a foraging behavior . 
And they had a lot of different techniques that they would use for foraging , but this particular one used vision . 
And they would see a coral head , maybe 10 feet away , and start moving over toward that coral head . 
And I do n't know whether they actually saw crab in it , or imagined that one might be , but whatever the case , they would leap off the bottom and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head , and then the web between the arms would completely engulf the coral head , and they would fish out , swim for crabs . 
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm , it was lights out . 
And I always wondered what happened under that web . 
So we created a way to find out , and I got my first look at that famous beak in action . 
It was fantastic . 
If you 're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals , you might as well pick one that 's fairly common . 
And octopus are , they live in all the oceans . 
They also live deep . 
And I ca n't say octopus are responsible for my really strong interest in getting in subs and going deep , but whatever the case , I like that . 
It 's like nothing you 've ever done . 
If you ever really want to get away from it all and see something that you have never seen , and have an excellent chance of seeing something no one has ever seen , get in a sub . 
You climb in , seal the hatch , turn on a little oxygen , turn on the scrubber , which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe , and they chuck you overboard . 
Down you go . There 's no connection to the surface apart from a pretty funky radio . 
And as you go down , the washing machine at the surface calms down . 
And it gets quiet . 
And it starts getting really nice . 
And as you go deeper , that lovely , blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue . 
And finally , it 's a rich lavender , and after a couple of thousand feet , it 's ink black . 
And now you 've entered the realm of the mid - water community . 
You could give an entire talk about the creatures that live in the mid - water . 
Suffice to say though , as far as I 'm concerned , without question , the most bizarre designs and outrageous behaviors are in the animals that live in the mid - water community . 
But we 're just going to zip right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid - ocean ridge , which I think is even more extraordinary . 
The mid - ocean ridge is a huge mountain range , 40,000 miles long , snaking around the entire globe . 
And they 're big mountains , thousands of feet tall , some of which are tens of thousands of feet and bust through the surface , creating islands like Hawaii . 
And the top of this mountain range is splitting apart , creating a rift valley . 
And when you dive into that rift valley , that 's where the action is because literally thousands of active volcanoes are going off at any point in time all along this 40,000 mile range . 
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart , magma , lava is coming up and filling those gaps , and you 're looking land -- new land -- being created right before your eyes . 
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure , forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth , until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals , reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone . 
In fact , this whole area is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings . 
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F. 
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing . 
So it immediately cools , and it can no longer hold in suspension all of the material that it 's dissolved , and it precipitates out , forming black smoke . 
And it forms these towers , these chimneys that are 10 , 20 , 30 feet tall . 
And all along the sides of these chimneys is shimmering with heat and loaded with life . 
You 've got black smokers going all over the place and chimneys that have tube worms that might be eight to 10 feet long . 
And out of the tops of these tube worms are these beautiful red plumes . 
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms is an entire community of animals : shrimp , fish , lobsters , crab , clams and swarms of arthropods that are playing that dangerous game between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold . 
And this whole ecosystem was n't even known about until 33 years ago . 
And it completely threw science on its head . 
It made scientists rethink where life on Earth might have actually begun . 
And before the discovery of these vents , all life on Earth , the key to life on Earth , was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis . 
But down there , there is no sun , there is no photosynthesis ; it 's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it , and it 's all so ephemeral . 
You might film this unbelievable hydrothermal vent , which you think at the time has to be on another planet . 
It 's amazing to think that this is actually on earth ; it looks like aliens in an alien environment . 
But you go back to the same vent eight years later and it can be completely dead . 
There 's no hot water . 
All of the animals are gone , they 're dead , and the chimneys are still there creating a really nice ghost town , an eerie , spooky ghost town , but essentially devoid of animals , of course . 
But 10 miles down the ridge ... 
pshhh ! There 's another volcano going . 
And there 's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed . 
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities is going on every 30 or 40 years all along the ridge . 
And that ephemeral nature of the hydrothermal vent community is n't really different from some of the areas that I 've seen in 35 years of traveling around , making films . 
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay . 
And you go back , and I 'm at home , and I 'm thinking , " Okay , what can I shoot ... 
Ah ! I know where I can shoot that . 
There 's this beautiful bay , lots of soft corals and stomatopods . " 
And you show up , and it 's dead . 
There 's no coral , algae growing on it , and the water 's pea soup . 
You think , " Well , what happened ? " 
And you turn around , and there 's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in , and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth . 
And over here there 's a golf course going in . 
And this is the tropics . 
It 's raining like crazy here . 
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside , carrying with it sediments from the construction site , smothering the coral and killing it . 
And fertilizers and pesticides are flowing into the bay from the golf course -- the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals , fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom -- and there 's your pea soup . 
But , encouragingly , I 've seen just the opposite . 
I 've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay . 
And I looked at it , just said , " Yuck , " and go and work on the other side of the island . 
Five years later , come back , and that same bay is now gorgeous . It 's beautiful . 
It 's got living coral , fish all over the place , crystal clear water , and you go , " How did that happen ? " 
Well , how it happened is the local community galvanized . 
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it ; enacted laws and made permits required to do responsible construction and golf course maintenance and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay , and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay , and the bay recovered . 
The ocean has an amazing ability to recover , if we 'll just leave it alone . 
I think Margaret Mead said it best . 
She said that a small group of thoughtful people could change the world . 
Indeed , it 's the only thing that ever has . 
And a small group of thoughtful people changed that bay . 
I 'm a big fan of grassroots organizations . 
I 've been to a lot of lectures where , at the end of it , inevitably , one of the first questions that comes up is , " But , but what can I do ? 
I 'm an individual . I 'm one person . 
And these problems are so large and global , and it 's just overwhelming . " 
Fair enough question . 
My answer to that is do n't look at the big , overwhelming issues of the world . 
Look in your own backyard . 
Look in your heart , actually . 
What do you really care about that is n't right where you live ? 
And fix it . 
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood and encourage others to do the same . 
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map , little dots on a map . 
And in fact , the way that we can communicate today -- where Alaska is instantly knowing what 's going on in China , and the Kiwis did this , and then over in England they tried to ... 
and everybody is talking to everyone else -- it 's not isolated points on a map anymore , it 's a network we 've created . 
And maybe these healing zones can start growing , and possibly even overlap , and good things can happen . 
So that 's how I answer that question . 
Look in your own backyard , in fact , look in the mirror . 
What can you do that is more responsible than what you 're doing now ? 
And do that , and spread the word . 
The vent community animals ca n't really do much about the life and death that 's going on where they live , but up here we can . 
In theory , we 're thinking , rational human beings . 
And we can make changes to our behavior that will influence and affect the environment , like those people changed the health of that bay . 
Now , Sylvia 's TED Prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could , everything we could , to set aside not pin pricks , but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation , " hope spots , " she calls them . 
And I applaud that . I loudly applaud that . 
And it 's my hope that some of these " hope spots " can be in the deep ocean , an area that has historically been seriously neglected , if not abused . 
The term " deep six " comes to mind : " If it 's too big or too toxic for a landfill , deep six it ! " 
So , I hope that we can also keep some of these " hope spots " in the deep sea . 
Now , I do n't get a wish , but I certainly can say that I will do anything I can to support Sylvia Earle 's wish . 
And that I do . 
Thank you very much .

Liza Donnelly : Drawing on humor for change 
I was afraid of womanhood . 
Not that I 'm not afraid now , but I 've learned to pretend . 
I 've learned to be flexible . 
In fact , I 've developed some interesting tools to help me deal with this fear . 
Let me explain . 
Back in the ' 50s and ' 60s , when I was growing up , little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft , and we were supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy -- really not quite clear what we were supposed to be . 
There were plenty of role models all around us . 
We had our mothers , our aunts , our cousins , our sisters , and of course , the ever - present media bombarding us with images and words , telling us how to be . 
Now my mother was different . 
She was a homemaker , but she and I did n't go out and do girlie things together , and she did n't buy me pink outfits . 
Instead , she knew what I needed , and she bought me a book of cartoons . 
And I just ate it up . 
I drew , and I drew , and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family , I could draw , do what I wanted to do , and not have to perform , not have to speak -- I was very shy -- and I could still get approval . 
I was launched as a cartoonist . 
Now when we 're young , we do n't always know . We know there are rules out there , but we do n't always know -- we do n't perform them right , even though we are imprinted at birth with these things , and we 're told what the most important color in the world is . 
We 're told what shape we 're supposed to be in . 
We 're told what to wear -- -- and how to do our hair -- -- and how to behave . 
Now the rules that I 'm talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture . 
We 're being corrected , and the primary policemen are women , because we are the carriers of the tradition . 
We pass it down from generation to generation . 
Not only that -- we always have this vague notion that something 's expected of us . 
And on top of all off these rules , they keep changing . 
We do n't know what 's going on half the time , so it puts us in a very tenuous position . 
Now if you do n't like these rules , and many of us do n't -- I know I did n't , and I still do n't , even though I follow them half the time , not quite aware that I 'm following them -- what better way than to change them [ than ] with humor ? 
Humor relies on the traditions of a society . 
It takes what we know , and it twists it . 
It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress , and it makes it unexpected , and that 's what elicits a laugh . 
Now what if you put together women and humor ? 
I think you can get change . 
Because women are on the ground floor , and we know the traditions so well , we can bring a different voice to the table . 
Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos . 
I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C. 
during the Civil Rights movement , the assassinations , the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement , and I think I was drawing , trying to figure out what was going on . 
And then also my family was in chaos , and I drew to try to bring my family together -- -- try to bring my family together with laughter . 
It did n't work . 
My parents got divorced , and my sister was arrested . 
But I found my place . 
I found that I did n't have to wear high heels , I did n't have to wear pink , and I could feel like I fit in . 
Now when I was a little older , in my 20s , I realized there are not many women in cartooning . 
And I thought , " Well , maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning , " and so I did . I became a cartoonist . 
And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking , " Well , why do n't I do something ? 
I always loved political cartoons , so why do n't I do something with the content of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we 're following as well as laugh ? " 
Now my perspective is a particularly -- -- my perspective is a particularly American perspective . 
I ca n't help it . I live here . 
Even though I 've traveled a lot , I still think like an American woman . 
But I believe that the rules that I 'm talking about are universal , of course -- that each culture has its different codes of behavior and dress and traditions , and each woman has to deal with these same things that we do here in the U.S. 
Consequently , we have . 
Women , because we 're on the ground , we know the tradition . 
We have amazing antennae . 
Now my work lately has been to collaborate with international cartoonists , which I so enjoy , and it 's given me a greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth , to get at the issues quickly and succinctly . 
And not only that , it can get to the viewer through not only the intellect , but through the heart . 
My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women cartoonists from across the world -- countries such as Saudi Arabia , Iran , Turkey , Argentina , France -- and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our difficulties . 
And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult circumstances . 
But I feel blessed to be able to work with them . 
And we talk about how women have such strong perceptions , because of our tenuous position and our role as tradition - keepers , that we can have the great potential to be change - agents . 
And I think , I truly believe , that we can change this thing one laugh at a time . 
Thank you .

Physicist Geoffrey West has found that simple , mathematical laws govern the properties of cities -- that wealth , crime rate , walking speed and many other aspects of a city can be deduced from a single number : the city 's population . In this mind - bending talk from TEDGlobal he shows how it works and how similar laws hold for organisms and corporations .

Geoffrey West : The surprising math of cities and corporations 
Cities are the crucible of civilization . 
They have been expanding , urbanization has been expanding , at an exponential rate in the last 200 years so that by the second part of this century , the planet will be completely dominated by cities . 
Cities are the origins of global warming , impact on the environment , health , pollution , disease , finance , economies , energy -- they 're all problems that are confronted by having cities . 
That 's where all these problems come from . 
And the tsunami of problems that we feel we 're facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet . 
Here 's some numbers . 
Two hundred years ago , the United States was less than a few percent urbanized . 
It 's now more than 82 percent . 
The planet has crossed the halfway mark a few years ago . 
China 's building 300 new cities in the next 20 years . 
Now listen to this : Every week for the foreseeable future , until 2050 , every week more than a million people are being added to our cities . 
This is going to affect everything . 
Everybody in this room , if you stay alive , is going to be affected by what 's happening in cities in this extraordinary phenomenon . 
However , cities , despite having this negative aspect to them , are also the solution . 
Because cities are the vacuum cleaners and the magnets that have sucked up creative people , creating ideas , innovation , wealth and so on . 
So we have this kind of dual nature . 
And so there 's an urgent need for a scientific theory of cities . 
Now these are my comrades in arms . 
This work has been done with an extraordinary group of people , and they 've done all the work , and I 'm the great bullshitter that tries to bring it all together . 
So here 's the problem : This is what we all want . 
The 10 billion people on the planet in 2050 want to live in places like this , having things like this , doing things like this , with economies that are growing like this , not realizing that entropy produces things like this , this , this and this . 
And the question is : Is that what Edinburgh and London and New York are going to look like in 2050 , or is it going to be this ? 
That 's the question . 
I must say , many of the indicators look like this is what it 's going to look like , but let 's talk about it . 
So my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities . 
And scientific theory means quantifiable -- relying on underlying generic principles that can be made into a predictive framework . 
That 's the quest . 
Is that conceivable ? 
Are there universal laws ? 
So here 's two questions that I have in my head when I think about this problem . 
The first is : Are cities part of biology ? 
Is London a great big whale ? 
Is Edinburgh a horse ? 
Is Microsoft a great big anthill ? 
What do we learn from that ? 
We use them metaphorically -- the DNA of a company , the metabolism of a city , and so on -- is that just bullshit , metaphorical bullshit , or is there serious substance to it ? 
And if that is the case , how come that it 's very hard to kill a city ? 
You could drop an atom bomb on a city , and 30 years later it 's surviving . 
Very few cities fail . 
All companies die , all companies . 
And if you have a serious theory , you should be able to predict when Google is going to go bust . 
So is that just another version of this ? 
Well we understand this very well . 
That is , you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size , how many branches of a given size does a tree have , how many leaves , what is the energy flowing through each branch , what is the size of the canopy , what is its growth , what is its mortality ? 
We have a mathematical framework based on generic universal principles that can answer those questions . 
And the idea is can we do the same for this ? 
So the route in is recognizing one of the most extraordinary things about life , is that it is scalable , it works over an extraordinary range . 
This is just a tiny range actually : It 's us mammals ; we 're one of these . 
The same principles , the same dynamics , the same organization is at work in all of these , including us , and it can scale over a range of 100 million in size . 
And that is one of the main reasons life is so resilient and robust -- scalability . 
We 're going to discuss that in a moment more . 
But you know , at a local level , you scale ; everybody in this room is scaled . 
That 's called growth . 
Here 's how you grew . 
Rat , that 's a rat -- could have been you . 
We 're all pretty much the same . 
And you see , you 're very familiar with this . 
You grow very quickly and then you stop . 
And that line there is a prediction from the same theory , based on the same principles , that describes that forest . 
And here it is for the growth of a rat , and those points on there are data points . 
This is just the weight versus the age . 
And you see , it stops growing . 
Very , very good for biology -- also one of the reasons for its great resilience . 
Very , very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm . 
This is what we believe . 
This is what our whole economy is thrusting upon us , particularly illustrated in that left - hand corner : hockey sticks . 
This is a bunch of software companies -- and what it is is their revenue versus their age -- all zooming away , and everybody making millions and billions of dollars . 
Okay , so how do we understand this ? 
So let 's first talk about biology . 
This is explicitly showing you how things scale , and this is a truly remarkable graph . 
What is plotted here is metabolic rate -- how much energy you need per day to stay alive -- versus your weight , your mass , for all of us bunch of organisms . 
And it 's plotted in this funny way by going up by factors of 10 , otherwise you could n't get everything on the graph . 
And what you see if you plot it in this slightly curious way is that everybody lies on the same line . 
Despite the fact that this is the most complex and diverse system in the universe , there 's an extraordinary simplicity being expressed by this . 
It 's particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms , each subsystem , each cell type , each gene , has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history . 
And yet , despite all of that Darwinian evolution and natural selection , they 've been constrained to lie on a line . 
Something else is going on . 
Before I talk about that , I 've written down at the bottom there the slope of this curve , this straight line . 
It 's three - quarters , roughly , which is less than one -- and we call that sublinear . 
And here 's the point of that . 
It says that , if it were linear , the steepest slope , then doubling the size you would require double the amount of energy . 
But it 's sublinear , and what that translates into is that , if you double the size of the organism , you actually only need 75 percent more energy . 
So a wonderful thing about all of biology is that it expresses an extraordinary economy of scale . 
The bigger you are systematically , according to very well - defined rules , less energy per capita . 
Now any physiological variable you can think of , any life history event you can think of , if you plot it this way , looks like this . 
There is an extraordinary regularity . 
So you tell me the size of a mammal , I can tell you at the 90 percent level everything about it in terms of its physiology , life history , etc . 
And the reason for this is because of networks . 
All of life is controlled by networks -- from the intracellular through the multicellular through the ecosystem level . 
And you 're very familiar with these networks . 
That 's a little thing that lives inside an elephant . 
And here 's the summary of what I 'm saying . 
If you take those networks , this idea of networks , and you apply universal principles , mathematizable , universal principles , all of these scalings and all of these constraints follow , including the description of the forest , the description of your circulatory system , the description within cells . 
One of the things I did not stress in that introduction was that , systematically , the pace of life decreases as you get bigger . 
Heart rates are slower ; you live longer ; diffusion of oxygen and resources across membranes is slower , etc . 
The question is : Is any of this true for cities and companies ? 
So is London a scaled up Birmingham , which is a scaled up Brighton , etc . , etc . ? 
Is New York a scaled up San Francisco , which is a scaled up Santa Fe ? 
Do n't know . We will discuss that . 
But they are networks , and the most important network of cities is you . 
Cities are just a physical manifestation of your interactions , our interactions , and the clustering and grouping of individuals . 
Here 's just a symbolic picture of that . 
And here 's scaling of cities . 
This shows that in this very simple example , which happens to be a mundane example of number of petrol stations as a function of size -- plotted in the same way as the biology -- you see exactly the same kind of thing . 
There is a scaling . 
That is that the number of petrol stations in the city is now given to you when you tell me its size . 
The slope of that is less than linear . 
There is an economy of scale . 
Less petrol stations per capita the bigger you are -- not surprising . 
But here 's what 's surprising . 
It scales in the same way everywhere . 
This is just European countries , but you do it in Japan or China or Colombia , always the same with the same kind of economy of scale to the same degree . 
And any infrastructure you look at -- whether it 's the length of roads , length of electrical lines -- anything you look at has the same economy of scale scaling in the same way . 
It 's an integrated system that has evolved despite all the planning and so on . 
But even more surprising is if you look at socio - economic quantities , quantities that have no analog in biology , that have evolved when we started forming communities eight to 10,000 years ago . 
The top one is wages as a function of size plotted in the same way . 
And the bottom one is you lot -- super - creatives plotted in the same way . 
And what you see is a scaling phenomenon . 
But most important in this , the exponent , the analog to that three - quarters for the metabolic rate , is bigger than one -- it 's about 1.15 to 1.2 . 
Here it is , which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita , unlike biology -- higher wages , more super - creative people per capita as you get bigger , more patents per capita , more crime per capita . 
And we 've looked at everything : more AIDS cases , flu , etc . 
And here , they 're all plotted together . 
Just to show you what we plotted , here is income , GDP -- GDP of the city -- crime and patents all on one graph . 
And you can see , they all follow the same line . 
And here 's the statement . 
If you double the size of a city from 100,000 to 200,000 , from a million to two million , 10 to 20 million , it does n't matter , then systematically you get a 15 percent increase in wages , wealth , number of AIDS cases , number of police , anything you can think of . 
It goes up by 15 percent , and you have a 15 percent savings on the infrastructure . 
This , no doubt , is the reason why a million people a week are gathering in cities . 
Because they think that all those wonderful things -- like creative people , wealth , income -- is what attracts them , forgetting about the ugly and the bad . 
What is the reason for this ? 
Well I do n't have time to tell you about all the mathematics , but underlying this is the social networks , because this is a universal phenomenon . 
This 15 percent rule is true no matter where you are on the planet -- Japan , Chile , Portugal , Scotland , does n't matter . 
Always , all the data shows it 's the same , despite the fact that these cities have evolved independently . 
Something universal is going on . 
The universality , to repeat , is us -- that we are the city . 
And it is our interactions and the clustering of those interactions . 
So there it is , I 've said it again . 
So if it is those networks and their mathematical structure , unlike biology , which had sublinear scaling , economies of scale , you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger . 
If it 's social networks with super - linear scaling -- more per capita -- then the theory says that you increase the pace of life . 
The bigger you are , life gets faster . 
On the left is the heart rate showing biology . 
On the right is the speed of walking in a bunch of European cities , showing that increase . 
Lastly , I want to talk about growth . 
This is what we had in biology , just to repeat . 
Economies of scale gave rise to this sigmoidal behavior . 
You grow fast and then stop -- part of our resilience . 
That would be bad for economies and cities . 
And indeed , one of the wonderful things about the theory is that if you have super - linear scaling from wealth creation and innovation , then indeed you get , from the same theory , a beautiful rising exponential curve -- lovely . 
And in fact , if you compare it to data , it fits very well with the development of cities and economies . 
But it has a terrible catch , and the catch is that this system is destined to collapse . 
And it 's destined to collapse for many reasons -- kind of Malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources . 
And how do you avoid that ? Well we 've done it before . 
What we do is , as we grow and we approach the collapse , a major innovation takes place and we start over again , and we start over again as we approach the next one , and so on . 
So there 's this continuous cycle of innovation that is necessary in order to sustain growth and avoid collapse . 
The catch , however , to this is that you have to innovate faster and faster and faster . 
So the image is that we 're not only on a treadmill that 's going faster , but we have to change the treadmill faster and faster . 
We have to accelerate on a continuous basis . 
And the question is : Can we , as socio - economic beings , avoid a heart attack ? 
So lastly , I 'm going to finish up in this last minute or two asking about companies . 
See companies , they scale . 
The top one , in fact , is Walmart on the right . 
It 's the same plot . 
This happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees . 
We could use sales , anything you like . 
There it is : after some little fluctuations at the beginning , when companies are innovating , they scale beautifully . 
And we 've looked at 23,000 companies in the United States , may I say . 
And I 'm only showing you a little bit of this . 
What is astonishing about companies is that they scale sublinearly like biology , indicating that they 're dominated , not by super - linear innovation and ideas ; they become dominated by economies of scale . 
In that interpretation , by bureaucracy and administration , and they do it beautifully , may I say . 
So if you tell me the size of some company , some small company , I could have predicted the size of Walmart . 
If it has this sublinear scaling , the theory says we should have sigmoidal growth . 
There 's Walmart . Does n't look very sigmoidal . 
That 's what we like , hockey sticks . 
But you notice , I 've cheated , because I 've only gone up to ' 94 . 
Let 's go up to 2008 . 
That red line is from the theory . 
So if I 'd have done this in 1994 , I could have predicted what Walmart would be now . 
And then this is repeated across the entire spectrum of companies . 
There they are . That 's 23,000 companies . 
They all start looking like hockey sticks , they all bend over , and they all die like you and me . 
Thank you .

Diana Laufenberg shares 3 surprising things she has learned about teaching -- including a key insight about learning from mistakes . 
children , culture , education 
1034 
Diana Laufenberg : How to learn ? From mistakes 
I have been teaching for a long time , and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students . 
In 1931 , my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade . 
She went to school to get the information because that 's where the information lived . 
It was in the books ; it was inside the teacher 's head ; and she needed to go there to get the information , because that 's how you learned . 
Fast - forward a generation : this is the one - room schoolhouse , Oak Grove , where my father went to a one - room schoolhouse . 
And he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher , stored it in the only portable memory he has , which is inside his own head , and take it with him , because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world . 
When I was a kid , we had a set of encyclopedias at my house . 
It was purchased the year I was born , and it was extraordinary , because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information . 
The information was inside my house and it was awesome . 
This was different than either generation had experienced before , and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level . 
But the information was closer to me . 
I could get access to it . 
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching , we really see the advent of the Internet . 
Right about the time that the Internet gets going as an educational tool , I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas , small town Kansas , where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely , small - town , rural Kansas school district , where I was teaching my favorite subject , American government . 
My first year -- super gung - ho -- going to teach American government , loved the political system . 
Kids in the 12th grade : not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system . 
Year two : learned a few things -- had to change my tactic . 
And I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves . 
I did n't tell them what to do or how to do it . 
I posed a problem in front of them , which was to put on an election forum for their own community . 
They produced fliers . They called offices . 
They checked schedules . They were meeting with secretaries . 
They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates . 
They invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and whether or not the streets were done well , and really had this robust experiential learning . 
The older teachers -- more experienced -- looked at me and went , " Oh , there she is . That 's so cute . She 's trying to get that done . " 
" She does n't know what she 's in for . " 
But I knew that the kids would show up , and I believed it , and I told them every week what I expected out of them . 
And that night , all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately , doing their job , owning it . 
I had to just sit and watch . 
It was theirs . It was experiential . It was authentic . 
It meant something to them . 
And they will step up . 
From Kansas , I moved on to lovely Arizona , where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years , this time with middle school students . 
Luckily , I did n't have to teach them American government . 
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography . 
Again , " thrilled " to learn . 
But what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona , was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school , and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities . 
And one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina , which is the gentleman that the movie " Hotel Rwanda " is based after . 
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us . 
We could walk there . We did n't even have to pay for the buses . 
There was no expense cost . Perfect field trip . 
The problem then becomes how do you take seventh- and eighth - graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful , and they know what to do with it . 
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive . 
I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life , or in their own story , or in their own world , that they could identify that had done a similar thing . 
I asked them to produce a little movie about it . 
It 's the first time we 'd done this . 
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer , but they were into it . And I asked them to put their own voice over it . 
It was the most awesome moment of revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves , what they 're willing to share . 
The last question of the assignment is : how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people ? 
The things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary . 
Fast - forward to Pennsylvania , where I find myself today . 
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy , which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the school district of Philadelphia . 
We are a nine through 12 public school , but we do school quite differently . 
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned , and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past , of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school , and to a moment when we have information surplus . 
So what do you do when the information is all around you ? 
Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information ? 
In Philadelphia we have a one - to - one laptop program , so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday , taking them home , getting access to information . 
And here 's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you 've given the tool to acquire information to students , is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process . 
We deal right now in the educational landscape with an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test , and I am here to share with you : it is not learning . 
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong . 
To ask them to always have the right answer does n't allow them to learn . 
So we did this project , and this is one of the artifacts of the project . 
I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure . 
My students produced these info - graphics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill . 
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the info - graphics that existed in a lot of mass media , and take a look at what were the interesting components of it , and produce one for themselves of a different man - made disaster from American history . 
And they had certain criteria to do it . 
They were a little uncomfortable with it , because we 'd never done this before , and they did n't know exactly how to do it . 
They can talk -- they 're very smooth , and they can write very , very well , but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them . 
But I gave them the room to just do the thing . 
Go create . Go figure it out . 
Let 's see what we can do . 
And the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint . 
This was done in like two or three days . 
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it . 
And when I sat the students down , I said , " Who 's got the best one ? " 
And they immediately went , " There it is . " 
Did n't read anything . " There it is . " 
And I said , " Well what makes it great ? " 
And they 're like , " Oh , the design 's good , and he 's using good color . 
And there 's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud . 
And I said , " Go read it . " 
And they 're like , " Oh , that one was n't so awesome . " 
And then we went to another one -- it did n't have great visuals , but it had great information -- and spent an hour talking about the learning process , because it was n't about whether or not it was perfect , or whether or not it was what I could create . 
It asked them to create for themselves , and it allowed them to fail , process , learn from . 
And when we do another round of this in my class this year , they will do better this time , because learning has to include an amount of failure , because failure is instructional in the process . 
There are a million pictures that I could click through here , and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites -- of students learning , of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information , but instead , ask them what they can do with it . 
Ask them really interesting questions . 
They will not disappoint . 
Ask them to go to places , to see things for themselves , to actually experience the learning , to play , to inquire . 
This is one of my favorite photos , because this was taken on Tuesday , when I asked the students to go to the polls . 
This is Robbie , and this was his first day of voting , and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that . 
But this is learning too , because we asked them to go out into real spaces . 
The main point is that , if we continue to look at education as if it 's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning , empowering student voice and embracing failure , we 're missing the mark . 
And everything that everybody is talking about today is n't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities , because we wo n't get there with a standardized test , and we wo n't get there with a culture of one right answer . 
We know how to do this better , and it 's time to do better .

Alan Russell on regenerating our bodies 
I 'm going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope . 
When we go to the physician today -- when we go to the doctor 's office and we walk in , there are words that we just do n't want to hear . 
There are words that we 're truly afraid of . 
Diabetes , cancer , Parkinson 's , Alzheimer 's , heart failure , lung failure -- things that we know are debilitating diseases , for which there 's relatively little that can be done . 
And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease , why it 's important , why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already has n't , and where we are clinically today , and where we might go tomorrow , and what some of the hurdles are . 
And we 're going to do all of that in 18 minutes , I promise . 
I want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it . 
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human . 
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue . 
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand . 
It 's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale . 
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there . 
We know that if we have a damaged hip , you can put an artificial hip in . 
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover . 
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine . 
This is not regenerative medicine . 
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago . 
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like -- and I 'll come back to that theme a few times -- instead of doing that , we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue . 
So that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment . 
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel . 
And this is just the same . 
If you look back in history , Charles Lindbergh , who was better known for flying airplanes , was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel , one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller , to begin to think about , could you culture organs ? 
And they published this book in 1937 , where they actually began to think about , what could you do in bio - reactors to grow whole organs ? 
We 've come a long way since then . 
I 'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that 's going on . 
But before doing that , what I 'd like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you . 
Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life , and reducing poverty , and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe . 
One of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live . 
And the longer we live , the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older . 
This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65 . 
And you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it . 
Why is this important ? 
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ? 
If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again , maybe a little bit of asthma . 
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55 , now the average person is looking at diabetes , early - onset diabetes , heart failure , coronary artery disease -- things that are inherently more difficult to treat , and much more expensive to treat . 
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here . 
This is from " The Untied States of America . " 
In 1930 , there were 41 workers per retiree . 
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease . 
In 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S. 
And this is matched in every industrialized , wealthy country in the world . 
How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ? 
This is age versus cost of health care . 
And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there 's a sudden spike in the cost of health care . 
It 's actually quite interesting . If you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care , plotted over your lifetime . 
And about seven years before you 're about to die , there 's a spike . 
And you can actually -- -- we wo n't get into that . 
There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging . 
I 'd suggest there are four things , and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system . 
All those things do is change who pays . 
They do n't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is . 
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ration health care . 
We wo n't talk about that anymore . It 's too depressing . 
You can prevent . 
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention . 
But perhaps most interesting , to me anyway , and most important , is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression , and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom . 
Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance . 
Today , with diabetes , what do we do ? 
We diagnose the disease eventually , once it becomes symptomatic , and then we treat the symptom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years . 
And we do OK . Insulin 's a pretty good therapy . 
But eventually it stops working , and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease . 
Why could n't we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was symptomatic ? 
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different . 
This video , I think , gets across the concept that I 'm talking about quite dramatically . 
This is a newt re - growing its limb . 
If a newt can do this kind of thing , why ca n't we ? 
I 'll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment . 
But what we 're talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body , for tissues and for organs themselves . 
So today 's reality is that if we get sick , the message is we will treat your symptoms , and you need to adjust to a new way of life . 
I would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate , but it 's within the foreseeable future -- we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation . 
There 's a limb prosthetic up here , similar actually one on the soldier that 's come back from Iraq . 
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs . 
Imagine if instead of facing that , they could actually face the regeneration of that limb . 
It 's a wild concept . 
I 'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept . 
But it 's applicable , again , to every organ system . 
How can we do that ? 
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body . 
We need to learn to speak the body 's language . 
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus . 
A mammalian fetus , if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy , will re - grow that limb . 
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound - healing mechanisms . 
It 's a natural process , but it is lost as we age . 
In a child , before the age of about six months , if they lose their fingertip in an accident , they 'll re - grow their fingertip . 
By the time they 're five , they wo n't be able to do that anymore . 
So to engage in that conversation with the body , we need to speak the body 's language . 
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today . 
I 'm going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body . 
The first is cellular therapies . 
Clearly , we heal ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work . 
Therefore , if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body , they may do the healing . 
Secondly , we can use materials . 
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials . 
If we can invent materials , design materials , or extract materials from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself . 
And finally , we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal . 
I 'm going to show you an example of each of these , and I 'm going to start with materials . 
Steve Badylak -- who 's at the University of Pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea . 
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself . 
And he asked a very important question . 
He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and I place it somewhere else on a person 's body , would it give a tissue - specific response , or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear ? 
I would n't be telling you this story if it were n't compelling . 
The picture I 'm about to show you is a compelling picture . 
However , for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish -- even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends -- the lights are down . This is a good time to look at your feet , check your Blackberry , do anything other than look at the screen . 
What I 'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer . 
And although -- it 's good to laugh before we look at this . 
This is the reality of diabetes . 
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics , diabetic ulcers , we just do n't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment , which is amputation , if you ca n't heal it . 
So I 'm going to put the slide up now . It wo n't be up for long . 
This is a diabetic ulcer . It 's tragic . 
The treatment for this is amputation . 
This is an older lady . She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes , and has decided to die with what ' s left of her body intact . 
And this lady decided , after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer , that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented . 
That 's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later . 
That material contained only natural signals . 
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it did n't have before . 
There 's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you -- I 'll let you know when you can look again . 
This is a horse . The horse is not in pain . 
If the horse was in pain , I would n't show you this slide . 
The horse just has another nostril that 's developed because of a riding accident . 
Just a few weeks after treatment -- in this case , taking that material , turning it into a gel , and packing that area , and then repeating the treatment a few times -- and the horse heals up . 
And if you took an ultrasound of that area , it would look great . 
Here 's a dolphin where the fin 's been re - attached . 
There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds . 
Could you regenerate a limb ? 
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight - institution project to begin the process of asking that question . 
And I 'll show you the 15 million dollar picture . 
This is a 78 year - old man who 's lost the end of his fingertip . 
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips . 
After treatment that 's what it looks like . 
This is happening today . 
This is clinically relevant today . 
There are materials that do this . Here are the heart patches . 
But could you go a little further ? 
Could you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and remove a damaged piece of tissue , put a bio - degradable material on there ? 
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish . 
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women 's Hospital . 
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish . 
He chills the dish , it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish . 
It 's the coolest stuff . 
Now I 'm going to show you cell - based regeneration . 
And what I 'm going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient . 
Again , if you 're squeamish , you do n't want to watch . 
But this one 's kind of cool . 
So this is a bypass operation , just like what Al Gore had , with a difference . 
In this case , at the end of the bypass operation , you 're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient . 
And I 'm standing up here because at one point I 'm going to show you just how early this technology is . 
Here go the stem cells , right into the beating heart of the patient . 
And if you look really carefully , it 's going to be right around this point you 'll actually see a back - flush . 
You see the cells coming back out . 
We need all sorts of new technology , new devices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time . 
Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data . 
This was a randomized trial . 
At this time this was an N of 20 . Now there 's an N of about 100 . 
Basically , if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass , they get a little bit better . 
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass , for these particular patients , they became asymptomatic . 
These are now two years out . 
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early , and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state . 
This is the same procedure , but now done minimally invasively , with only three holes in the body where they 're taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure . 
There go the cells . 
We do n't have time to go into all of those details , but basically , that works too . 
You can take patients who are less sick , and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy . 
Here 's another example of stem - cell therapy that is n't quite clinical yet , but I think very soon will be . 
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh , along with a number of colleagues around the world . 
They 've decided that liposuction fluid , which -- in the United States , we have a lot of liposuction fluid . 
It 's a great source of stem cells . 
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid . 
So you could go in , you could get your tummy - tuck . 
Out comes the liposuction fluid , and in this case , the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons . 
All done in the lab . 
And I think fairly soon , you will see patients being treated with their own fat - derived , or adipose - derived , stem cells . 
I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease . 
Here 's just one example before I close up . 
This is equally tragic . 
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army , who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq . 
Many of those patients are very severely burned . 
And if there 's anything that 's been learned about burn , it 's that we do n't know how to treat it . 
Everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a sodding approach . 
We make something over here , and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound , and we try and get the two to take . 
In this case here , a new , wearable bio - reactor has been designed -- it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR -- by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh . 
And that bio - reactor will lay down in the wound bed . 
The gun that you see there sprays cells . 
That 's going to spray cells over that area . 
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment , deliver other things as well at the same time , and therefore we will seed that lawn , as opposed to try the sodding approach . 
It 's a completely different way of doing it . 
So my 18 minutes is up . 
So let me finish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news . 
The good news is that this is happening today . 
It 's very powerful work . 
Clearly the images kind of get that across . 
It 's incredibly difficult because it 's highly inter - disciplinary . 
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen . 
A number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease . 
The Japanese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to invest first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field . 
It 's no coincidence . 
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age . 
They need this to work or their health system dies . 
So they 're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area . 
The European Union , same thing . 
China , the same thing . 
China just launched a national tissue - engineering center . 
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars . 
In the United States we 've had a somewhat different approach . 
Oh , for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president . 
We 've had a different approach . 
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along . 
But there 's been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way . 
And I 'm going to finish up with a quote , maybe a little cheap shot , at the director of the NIH , who 's a very charming man . 
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago , to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he 's going to get next year and focus it , in a strategic way , to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients . 
And at the end of a very testy meeting , what the NIH director said was , " Your vision is larger than our appetite . " 
I 'd like to close by saying that no one 's going to change our vision , but together we can change his appetite . 
Thank you .

Sarah Jones as a one - woman global village 
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here , I thought to myself that well , it 's TED . 
And these TEDsters are -- you know , as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world . 
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that ? 
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized - sounding British accent might help things a bit . 
And then I thought no , no . I should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way I really talk because , after all , this is the great unveiling . 
And so I thought I 'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you . 
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen 's English because I am from Queens , New York . 
But the theme of this session , of course , is invention . 
And while I do n't have any patents that I 'm aware of , you will be meeting a few of my inventions today . 
I suppose it 's fair to say that I am interested in the invention of self or selves . 
We 're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits , unique developmental experiences , geographical and historical contexts . 
But then what ? 
To what extent do we self - construct , do we self - invent ? 
How do we self - identify and how mutable is that identity ? 
Like , what if one could be anyone at any time ? 
Well my characters , like the ones in my shows , allow me to play with the spaces between those questions . 
And so I 've brought a couple of them with me . 
And well , they 're very excited . 
What I should tell you -- what I should tell you is that they 've each prepared their own little TED talks . 
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University . 
Okay . Okay . Oh , well . 
Oh , wonderful . 
Good evening everybody . 
Thank you so very much for having me here today . 
Ah , thank you very much . My name is Lorraine Levine . 
Oh my ! There 's so many of you . 
Hi sweetheart . Okay . 
Anyway , I am here because of a young girl , Sarah Jones . 
She 's a very nice , young black girl . 
Well you know , she calls herself black -- she 's really more like a caramel color if you look at her . 
But anyway . 
She has me here because she puts me in her show , what she calls her one - woman show . 
And you know what that means , of course . 
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work . 
But I do n't mind . 
Frankly , I 'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this , you know . 
Really , it 's amazing . 
Not only , of course , the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities . 
There are so many celebrities running around here . 
I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier . I love her . 
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe . 
Is n't that adorable ? 
So many others you see , they 're just wonderful . 
It 's lovely to know they 're concerned , you know . 
And -- oh , I saw Goldie Hawn . 
Oh , Goldie Hawn . I love her , too ; she 's wonderful . Yeah . 
You know , she 's only half Jewish . 
Did you know that about her ? 
Yeah . But even so , a wonderful talent . 
And I -- you know , when I saw her , such a wonderful feeling . 
Yeah , she 's lovely . 
But anyway , I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel . 
It 's such an eye - opening experience to be here . 
You 're all so responsible for this world that we live in today . 
You know , I could n't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl . 
And you 've all made these advancements happen in such a short time -- you 're all so young . 
You know , your parents must be very proud . 
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here . 
I noticed it 's very multicultural . 
You know , when you 're standing up here , you can see all the different people . 
It 's like a rainbow . 
It 's okay to say rainbow . Yeah . 
I just -- I ca n't keep up with whether you can say , you know , the different things . 
What are you allowed to say or not say ? 
I just -- I do n't want to offend anybody . You know . 
But anyway , you know , I just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally , some of you , the architects building our brighter future . 
You know , it 's heartening to me . 
Even though , quite frankly , some of your presentations are horrifying , absolutely horrifying . 
It 's true . It 's true . 
You know , between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you 're talking about . 
And of course , we know it 's all because of the -- all the ... 
Well , I do n't know how else to say it to you , so I 'll just say it my way : the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the , you know , the bankers and the Wall Street . You know it . 
Anyway . 
The point is , I 'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess . 
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements . 
Thank you for all that you do . 
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you 've become TED meisters . 
So , happy continued success . 
Congratulations . Mazel tov . 
Hi . Hi . 
Thank you everybody . 
Sorry , this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything , to be here right now . 
My name is Noraida . And I 'm just -- I 'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference that you 're doing and everything like that . 
I am Dominican - American . 
Actually , you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic , otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City . 
But I do n't know if there 's any other Dominican people here , but I know that Juan Enriquez , he was here yesterday . 
And I think he 's Mexican , so that 's -- honestly , that 's close enough for me right now . So -- I just -- I 'm sorry . 
I 'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything . 
And I just -- you know I 'm not used to doing the public speaking . 
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast . 
Nobody can understand nothing I 'm saying , which is very frustrating for me , as you can imagine . 
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath . 
But then on top of that , you know , Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes . 
So then I 'm like , should I be nervous , you know , because maybe it 's better . 
And I 'm just trying not to panic and freak out . So I like , take a deep breath . 
Okay . Sorry . So anyway , what I was trying to say is that I really love TED . 
Like , I love everything about this . It 's amazing . 
Like , it 's -- I ca n't get over this right now . 
And , like , people would not believe , seriously , where I 'm from , that this even exists . 
You know , like even , I mean I love like the name , the -- TED . 
I mean I know it 's a real person and everything , but I 'm just saying that like , you know , I think it 's very cool how it 's also an acronym , you know , which is like , you know , is like very high concept and everything like that . 
I like that . 
And actually , I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything . 
Because , actually , I 'm a sophomore at college right now . 
At my school -- actually I was part of co - founding an organization , which is like a leadership thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything . 
And the organization is called DA BOMB , A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything -- it 's like , DA BOMB , it means like Dominican -- it 's an acronym -- Dominican - American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies . 
So , I know , see , like the name is like a little bit long , but with the war on terror and everything , the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea , whatever . 
So , basically like DA BOMB -- what Dominican - American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does is , basically , we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me . 
I am a working mother , and I also go to school full - time . 
And , you know , it 's like -- it 's so important to have like role models out there . 
I mean , I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different , whatever . 
But like even at my job -- like , I just got promoted . 
Right now it 's very exciting actually for me because I 'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director under the Senior Vice President for Business Development -- that 's my new title . 
So , but I think whether you own your own company or you 're just starting out like me , like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning . 
And if everybody , like all people really had access to that , it would be a very different world out there , as I know you know . 
So , I think all people , we need that , but especially , I look at people like me , you know like , I mean , Latinos -- we 're about to be the majority , in like two weeks . 
So , we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else . 
So , I 'm very happy that you 're , you know , doing this kind of thing , making the talks available online . 
That 's very good . I love that . 
And I just -- I love you guys . I love TED . 
And if you do n't mind , privately now , in the future , I 'm going to think of TED as an acronym for Technology , Entertainment and Dominicans . 
Thank you very much . 
So , that was Noraida , and just like Lorraine and everybody else you 're meeting today , these are folks who are based on real people from my real life : friends , neighbors , family members . 
I come from a multicultural family . 
In fact , the older lady you just met : very , very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother 's side . 
It 's a long story , believe me . 
But on top of my family background , my parents also sent me to the United Nations school , where I encountered a plethora of new characters , including Alexandre , my French teacher , okay . 
Well , you know , it was beginner French , that I am taking with her , you know . 
And it was Madame Bousson , you know , she was very [ French ] . 
It was like , you know , she was there in the class , you know , she was kind of typically French . 
You know , she was very chic , but she was very filled with ennui , you know . 
And she would be there , you know , kind of talking with the class , you know , talking about the , you know , the existential futility of life , you know . 
And we were only 11 years old , so it was not appropriate . 
But [ German ] . 
Yes , I took German for three years , [ German ] , and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class , even in the UN school . 
Although , you know , it was wonderful . 
The teacher , Herr Schtopf , he never discriminated . 
Never . He always , always treated each of us , you know , equally unbearably during the class . 
So , there were the teachers and then there were my friends , classmates from everywhere , many of whom are still dear friends to this day . 
And they 've inspired many characters as well . 
For example , a friend of mine . 
Well , I just wanted to quickly say good evening . 
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity . 
Of course , TED , the reputation precedes itself all over the world . 
But , you know , I am originally from India , and I wanted to start by telling you that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to TED in California , originally , I was very pleased and , frankly , relieved because , you know , I am a human rights advocate . 
And usually my work , it takes me to Washington D.C. 
And there , I must attend these meetings , mingling with some tiresome politicians , trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown . 
So , you can just imagine -- right . 
So , but I 'm thrilled to be joining all of you here . 
I wish we had more time together , but that 's for another time . Okay ? Great . 
And , sadly , I do n't think we 'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought , but -- I 'm trying to behave myself , it 's my first time here . 
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize , if you saw " Bridge and Tunnel . " 
Uh , well , thank you . 
Good evening . 
My name is Pauline Ning , and first I want to tell you that I 'm -- of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York . 
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED , I said , well , you know , first , I do n't know that , you know -- before two years ago , you would not find me in front of an audience of people , much less like this because I did not like to give speeches because I feel that , as an immigrant , I do not have good English skills for speaking . 
But then , I decided , just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , I try anyway . 
My daughter -- my daughter wrote that , she told me , " Always start your speech with humor . " 
But my background -- I want to tell you story only briefly . 
My husband and I , we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s to have the freedom we can not have in China at that time . 
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition , but it 's very hard . 
You know , as immigrant , I would speak Chinese to them , and they would always answer me back in English . 
They love rock music , pop culture , American culture . 
But when they got older , when the time comes for them to start think about getting married , that 's when we expect them to realize , a little bit more , their own culture . 
But that 's where we had some problems . 
My son , he says he is not ready to get married . 
And he has a sweetheart , but she is American woman , not Chinese . 
It 's not that it 's bad , but I told him , " What 's wrong with a Chinese woman ? " 
But I think he will change his mind soon . 
So , then I decide instead , I will concentrate on my daughter . 
The daughter 's marriage is very special to the mom . 
But first , she said she 's not interested . 
She only wants to spend time with her friends . 
And then at college , it 's like she never came home . 
And she does n't want me to come and visit . 
So I said , " What 's wrong in this picture ? " 
So , I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend . 
But she told me , " Mom , you do n't have to worry about boys because I do n't like them . " 
And I said , " Yes , men can be difficult , but all women have to get used to that . " 
She said , " No Mom . I mean , I do n't like boys . I like girls . 
I am lesbian . " 
So , I always teach my kids to respect American ideas , but I told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay , she is just confused by this American problem . 
But she told me , " Mom , it 's not American . " 
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl . 
So , these are the words I am waiting to hear , but from my son , not my daughter . 
But at first I did not know what to do . 
But then , over time , I have come to understand that this is who she is . 
So , even though sometimes it 's still hard , I will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant , usually because of places like this , because of ideas like this , and people like you , with an open mind . 
So I think maybe TED , you impact people 's lives in the ways maybe even you do n't realize . 
So , for my daughter 's sake , I thank you for your ideas worth spreading . 
Thank you . Xie xie . 
Good evening . My name is Habbi Belahal . 
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her to be last today . 
I am originally from Jordan . 
And I teach comparative literature at Queens College . 
It is not Harvard . 
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water . 
But I am very proud of my students . 
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference . 
So you will get the extra credit I promised you . 
But , while I know that I may not look like the typical TED - izen , as you would say , I do like to make the point that we in global society , we are never as different as the appearances may suggest . 
So , if you will indulge me , I will share quickly with you a bit of verse , which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age . 
So , back in the ancient times . 
[ Arabic ] And this roughly translates : " Please , let me hold your hand . 
I want to hold your hand . 
I want to hold your hand . 
And when I touch you , I feel happy inside . 
It 's such a feeling that my love , I ca n't hide , I ca n't hide , I ca n't hide . " 
Well , so okay , but please , please , but please . 
If it is sounding familiar , it is because I was at the same time in my life listening to the Beatles . 
On the radio [ unclear ] , they were very popular . 
So , all of that is to say that I like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another , there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme . 
And I pray that this is the way that we will self - invent , in time . 
That 's all , shukran . Thank you very much for the opportunity . 
Okay ? Great . 
Thank you all very much . It was lovely . 
Thank you for having me . 
Thank you very , very much . I love you . 
Well , you have to let me say this . 
I just -- thank you . 
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline , and just everyone for having me here . 
It 's been a long time coming , and I feel like I 'm home . 
And I know I 've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere , but this is honestly one of the best audiences I 've ever experienced . 
The whole thing is amazing , and so do n't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon .

Dr. Seyi Oyesola tours a hospital in Nigeria 
Just to put everything in context , and to kind of give you a background to where I 'm coming from , so that a lot of the things I 'm going to say , and the things I 'm going to do -- or things I 'm going to tell you I 've done -- you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am . 
I graduated high school in Cleveland , Ohio , 1975 . 
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad , we went back home . 
Finished university education , got a medical degree , 1986 . 
And by the time I was an intern house officer , I could barely afford to maintain my mother 's 13-year - old car -- and I was a paid doctor . 
This brings us to why a lot of us , who are professionals , are now , as they say , in diaspora . 
Now , are we going to make that a permanent thing , where we all get trained , and we leave , and we do n't go back ? 
Perhaps not , I should certainly hope not -- because that is not my vision . 
All right , for good measure , that 's where Nigeria is on the African map , and just there is the Delta region that I 'm sure everybody 's heard of . 
People getting kidnapped , where the oil comes from , the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria . 
But , critical poverty : this slide is from a presentation I gave not that long ago . Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care . 
Very interesting . 
How many people do you think are on that taxi ? 
And believe it or not , that is a taxi in Nigeria . 
And the capital -- well , what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos , that 's a taxi , and you have police on them . 
So , tell me , how many policemen do you think are on this taxi ? And now ? Three . 
So , when these kind of people -- and , believe me , it 's not just the police that use these taxis in Lagos . We all do . I 've been on one of these , and I did n't have a helmet , either . 
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off , has an accident and needs a hospital . 
Believe it or not , some of us do survive . 
Some of us do survive malaria ; we do survive AIDS . 
And like I tell my family , and my wife reminds me every time , " You 're risking your life , you know , every time you go to that country . " 
And she 's right . Every time you go there , you know that if you actually need critical care -- critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident -- of which there are many , there are accidents everywhere -- where do they go ? 
Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff ? 
I 'm not saying instead of , I 'm saying as well as , AIDS , TB , malaria , typhoid -- the list goes on . 
I 'm saying , where do they go when they 're like me ? 
When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things , I teach , I train -- but I catch one of these things , or I 'm chronically ill with one of those , where do they go ? 
What 's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled ? 
I think it 's quite significant . This is where they go . 
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden -- this is a major hospital . In fact , it 's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria . 
Now that is less than a year old , in an operating room . 
That 's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria . 
You remember all that oil ? 
Yes , I 'm sorry if it upsets some of you , but I think you need to see this . That 's the floor , OK ? 
You can say some of this is education . 
You can say it 's hygiene . I 'm not pleading poverty . 
I 'm saying we need more than just , you know , vaccination , malaria , AIDS , because I want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there . 
In fact , when I start running around saying , " Hey , boys and girls , you 're cardiologists in the U.S. , can you come home with me and do a mission ? " 
I want them to think , " Well there 's some hope . " 
Now , have a look at that . That 's the anesthesiology machine . 
And that 's my specialty , right ? 
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag . 
It 's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K. 
And believe me , these are current pictures . 
Now , if something like this , which has happened in the U.K. , that 's where they go . This is the intensive care unit in which I work . 
All right , this is a slide from a talk I gave about intensive care units in Nigeria , and jokingly we refer to it as " Expensive Scare . " 
Because it 's scary and it 's expensive , but we need to have it , OK ? 
So , these are the problems . 
There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are , are there ? 
I think we all know . And several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems . 
These are a few of them . So , what did I do ? 
There we go -- we 're going on a mission . 
We 're going to do some open - heart surgery . I was the only Brit , on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons , cardiac nurse , intensive care nurse . 
We all went out and did a mission and we 've done three of them so far . 
Just so you know , I do believe in missions , I do believe in aid and I do believe in charity . They have their place , but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier ? 
Because it 's not everyone that 's going to benefit from a mission . 
Health is wealth , in the words of Hans Rosling . 
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first . 
So , here we are , mission . Big trouble . 
Open - heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble . 
That 's Mike , Mike comes out from Mississippi . 
Does he look like he 's happy ? 
It took us two days just to organize the place , but hey , you know , we worked on it . Does he look happy ? 
Yes , that 's the medical advice the committee chairman says , " Yes , I told you , you were n't going to be able to , you ca n't do this , I just know it . " 
Look , that 's the technician we had . So yes , you go on , all right ? 
I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K. 
Yes , let 's just go work this thing out . 
See , that 's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally . 
We get a lot of donated equipment . 
Equipment that 's obsolete , equipment that does n't quite work , or it works and you ca n't fix it . And there 's nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on . 
But we had problems with it . We had severe problems there . 
He had to get on the phone . This guy was always on the phone . 
So what we going to do now ? 
It looks like all these Americans are here and yes , one Brit , and he 's not going to do anything -- he thinks he 's British actually , and he 's actually Nigerian , I just thought about that . 
We eventually got it working , is the truth , but it was one of these . Even older than the one you saw . 
The reason I have this picture here , this X - ray , it 's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X - rays . 
Do you figure where that is ? It was on a window . 
I mean , what 's an X - ray viewing box ? Please . 
Well , nowadays everything 's on PAX anyway . 
You look at your X - rays on a screen and you do stuff with them , you email them . But we were still using X - rays , but we did n't even have a viewing box ! 
And we were doing open - heart surgery . 
OK , I know it 's not AIDS , I know it 's not malaria , but we still need this stuff . Oh yeah , echo -- this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready . 
People still believe in Voodoo . Heart disease , VSD , hole in the heart , tetralogies . 
You still get people who believe in it and they came . 
At 67 percent oxygen saturation , the normal is about 97 . 
Her condition , open - heart surgery that as she required , would have been treated when she was a child . 
We had to do these for adults . So , we did succeed and we still do . 
We 've done three . We 're planning another one in July in the north of the country . So , we certainly still do open - heart , but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in -- we ship everything , instruments . We had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who were n't used to it . 
The oxygen tanks did n't quite work right . 
But how many did we do the first one ? 12 . 
We did 12 open - heart surgical patients successfully . 
Here is our very first patient , out of intensive care , and just watch that chair , all right ? 
This is what I mean about appropriate technology . 
That 's what he was doing , propping up the bed because the bed simply did n't work . 
Have you seen one of those before ? 
No ? Yes ? Does n't matter , it worked . 
I 'm sure you 've all seen or heard this before : " We , the willing , have been doing so much with so little for so long -- -- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing . " 
Thank you . Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company . 
This one 's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing . 
So , we put my hand in my pocket and say , " Guys , let 's just buy stuff . 
Let 's go set up a company that teaches people , educates them , gives them the tools they need to keep going . " 
And that 's a perfect example of one . 
Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital , you buy a different one for children , you buy a different one for transport . This one will do everything , and it will do it at half the price and does n't need compressed air . 
If you 're in America and you do n't know about this one , we do , because we make it our duty to find out what 's appropriate technology for Africa -- what 's appropriately priced , does the job , and we move on . Anesthesia machine : multi - parameter monitor , operating lights , suction . 
This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car , that charges your , whatever , Game Boy , telephone ? 
That 's exactly how the outlets are designed . 
Yes , it will take a solar panel . Yes a solar panel will charge it . 
But if you 've got mains as well , it will charge the batteries in there . 
And guess what ? We have a little pedal charger too , just in case . 
And guess what , if it all fails , if you can find a car that 's still got a live battery and you stick it in , it will still work . Then you can customize it . 
Is it dental surgery you want ? General surgery you want ? 
Decide which instruments , stock it up with consumables . 
And currently we 're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on - site . 
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new . 
Oxygen concentrators are very old technology . What is new , and what we will have in a few months , I hope , is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site . Zeolite -- it 's not new -- zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air . 
If you take nitrogen out , what 's left ? Oxygen , pretty much . 
So that 's not new . What we 're doing is applying this technology to it . 
These are the basic features of my device , or our device . 
This is what makes it so special . 
Apart from the awards it 's won , it 's portable and it 's certified . It 's registered , the MHRA -- and the CE mark , for those who do n't know , for Europe , is the equivalent of the FDA in the U.S. 
If you compare it with what 's on the market , price - wise , size - wise , ease of use , complexity ... 
This picture was taken last year . 
These are members of my graduating class , 1986 . 
It was in this gentleman 's house in the Potomac , for those of you who are familiar with Maryland . 
There are too many of us outside and everybody , just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling , he 's my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention , it 's the problems . But what we really need are African solutions that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture , looking at the people , looking at how much money they 've got . 
African people , because they will do it with a passion , I hope . 
And lots and lots of that little bit down there , sacrifice . 
You have to do it . Africans have to do it , in conjunction with everyone else . 
Thank you .

Jeff Skoll makes movies that matter 
I 've actually been waiting by the phone for a call from TED for years . 
And in fact , in 2000 , I was ready to talk about eBay , but no call . 
In 2003 , I was ready to do a talk about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship . No call . 
In 2004 , I started Participant Productions and we had a really good first year , and no call . 
And finally , I get a call last year , and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams . 
You 've got a cruel sense of humor , TED . 
When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley , But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood . 
And , in fact , some advantages to owning your own media company . 
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed . 
Hollywood has its sex symbols , and the Valley has its sex symbols . 
Hollywood has its rivalries , and the Valley has its rivalries . 
Hollywood gathers around power tables , and the Valley gathers around power tables . 
So it turned out there was a lot more in common than I would have dreamed . 
But I 'm actually here today to tell a story . 
And part of it is a personal story . When Chris invited me to speak , he said , people think of you as a bit of an enigma , and they want to know what drives you a bit . 
And what really drives me is a vision of the future that I think we all share . 
It 's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability . 
And when we heard a lot of the presentations over the last couple of days , Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey , I think we all realized how far we have to go to get to this new version of humanity that I like to call " Humanity 2.0 . " 
And it 's also something that resides in each of us , to close what I think are the two big calamities in the world today . 
One is the gap in opportunity -- this gap that President Clinton last night called uneven , unfair and unsustainable -- and , out of that , comes poverty and illiteracy and disease and all these evils that we see around us . 
But perhaps the other , bigger gap is what we call the hope gap . 
And someone , at some point , came up with this very bad idea that an ordinary individual could n't make a difference in the world . 
And I think that 's just a horrible thing . 
And so chapter one really begins today , with all of us , because within each of us is the power to equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps . 
And if the men and women of TED ca n't make a difference in the world , I do n't know who can . 
And for me , a lot of this started when I was younger and my family used to go camping in upstate New York . 
And there really was n't much to do there for the summer , except get beaten up by my sister or read books . 
And so I used to read authors like James Michener and James Clavell and Ayn Rand . 
And their stories made the world seem a very small and interconnected place . 
And it struck me that if I could write stories that were about this world as being small and interconnected , that maybe I could get people interested in the issues that affected us all , and maybe engage them to make a difference . 
I did n't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living , so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent , so I could write these stories as quickly as I could . 
I then had a bit of a wake - up call when I was 14 . 
And my dad came home one day and announced that he had cancer , and it looked pretty bad . 
And what he said was , he was n't so much afraid that he might die , but that he had n't done the things that he wanted to with his life . 
And knock on wood , he 's still alive today , many years later . 
But for a young man that made a real impression on me , that one never knows how much time one really has . 
So I set out in a hurry . I studied engineering . 
I started a couple of businesses that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom . 
One of those businesses was a computer rental business called Micros on the Move , which is very well named , because people kept stealing the computers . 
So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business , so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there . 
And while I was there , I made friends with a fellow named Pierre Omidyar , who is here today . And Pierre , I apologize for this . This is a photo from the old days . 
And just after I 'd graduated , Pierre came to me with this idea to help people buy and sell things online with each other . 
And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree , I said , " Pierre , what a stupid idea . " 
And needless to say , I was right . 
But right after that , Pierre -- in ' 96 , Pierre and I left our full - time jobs to build eBay as a company . And the rest of that story , you know . 
The company went public two years later and is today one of the best known companies in the world . 
Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries , and so on . 
But for me , personally , it was a real change . 
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto and living off their leftovers , to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources . 
And I wanted to figure out how I could take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world . 
And around that time , I met John Gardner , who is a remarkable man . 
He was the architect of the Great Society programs under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s . 
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do , or anyone could do , to make a difference in the long - term issues facing humanity . 
And John said , " Bet on good people doing good things . 
Bet on good people doing good things . " 
And that really resonated with me . 
I started a foundation to bet on these good people doing good things . 
These leading , innovative , nonprofit folks , who are using business skills in a very leveraged way to solve social problems . 
People today we call social entrepreneurs . 
And to put a face on it , people like Muhammad Yunus , who started the Grameen Bank , has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world , won the Nobel Peace Prize . 
But there 's also a lot of people that you do n't know . 
Folks like Ann Cotton , who started a group called CAMFED in Africa , because she felt girls ' education was lagging . 
And she started it about 10 years ago , and today , she educates over a quarter million African girls . 
And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale , who started the world 's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company , and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis , also known as black fever . 
And by 2010 , she hopes to eliminate this disease , which is really a scourge in the developing world . 
And so this is one way to bet on good people doing good things . 
And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change that I find really is powerful . 
It 's what we call , " Invest , connect and celebrate . " 
And invest : if you see good people doing good things , invest in them . Invest in their organizations , or in business . Invest in these folks . 
Connecting them together through conferences -- like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections , or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship that my foundation does at Oxford every year . 
And celebrate them : tell their stories , because not only are there good people doing good work , but their stories can help close these gaps of hope . 
And it was this last part of the mission , the celebrate part , that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid and wanted to tell stories to get people involved in the issues that affect us all . 
And a light bulb went off , which was , first , that I did n't actually have to do the writing myself , I could find writers . 
And then the next light bulb was , better than just writing , what about film and TV , to get out to people in a big way ? 
And I thought about the films that inspired me , films like " Gandhi " and " Schindler 's List . " 
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today . 
And there really was n't a specific company that was focused on the public interest . 
So , in 2003 , I started to make my way around Los Angeles to talk about the idea of a pro - social media company and I was met with a lot of encouragement . 
One of the lines of encouragement that I heard over and over was , " The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you , who think you 're going to come to this town and make movies . " 
And then of course , there was the other adage . 
" The surest way to become a millionaire is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business . " 
Undeterred , in January of 2004 , I started Participant Productions with the vision to be a global media company focused on the public interest . 
And our mission is to produce entertainment that creates and inspires social change . 
And we do n't just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it . 
We want them to actually get involved in the issues . 
In 2005 , we launched our first slate of films , " Murder Ball , " " North Country , " " Syriana " and " Good Night and Good Luck . " 
And much to my surprise , they were noticed . 
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films . 
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy . 
Perhaps more importantly , tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs and the activism programs that we created to go around the movies . 
And we had an online component of that , our community sect called Participate.net . 
But with our social sector partners , like the ACLU and PBS and the Sierra Club and the NRDC , once people saw the film , there was actually something they could do to make a difference . 
One of these films in particular , called " North Country , " was actually kind of a box office disaster . 
But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron and it was about women 's rights , women 's empowerment , domestic violence and so on . 
And we released the film at the same time that the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act . 
And with screenings on the Hill , and discussions , and with our social sector partners , like the National Organization of Women , the film was widely credited with influencing the successful renewal of the act . 
And that to me , spoke volumes , because it 's -- the film started about a true - life story about a woman who was harassed , sued her employer , led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act , and the Violence Against Women Act and others . 
And then the movie about this person doing these things , then led to this greater renewal . 
And so again , it goes back to betting on good people doing good things . 
Speaking of which , our fellow TEDster , Al -- I first saw Al do his slide show presentation on global warming in May of 2005 . 
At that point , I thought I knew something about global warming . 
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem . 
And after we saw his slide show , it became clear that it was much more urgent . 
And so right afterwards , I met backstage with Al , and with Lawrence Bender , who was there , and Laurie David , and Davis Guggenheim , who was running documentaries for Participant at the time . 
And with Al 's blessing , we decided on the spot to turn it into a film , because we felt that we could get the message out there far more quickly than having Al go around the world , speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time . 
And you know , there 's another adage in Hollywood , that nobody knows nothing about anything . 
And I really thought this was going to be a straight - to - PBS charitable initiative . 
And so it was a great shock to all of us when the film really captured the public interest , and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland , and most of Scandinavia . 
We 've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S. 
and it 's really changed the debate on global warming . 
It was also a pretty good year for this guy . 
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming . 
And for Participant , this is just the start . 
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world . 
And we have 10 films in production right now , and dozens others in development . 
I 'll quickly talk about a few coming up . 
One is " Charlie Wilson 's War , " with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts . 
And it 's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson , and how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan . 
And we 're also doing a movie called " The Kite Runner , " based on the book " The Kite Runner , " also about Afghanistan . 
And we think once people see these films , they 'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world and the Middle East in general . 
We premiered a film called " The Chicago 10 " at Sundance this year . 
It 's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968 , Abby Hoffman and crew , and , again , a story about a small group of individuals who did make change in the world . 
And a documentary that we 're doing on Jimmy Carter and his Mid - East peace efforts over the years . 
And in particular , we 've been following him on his recent book tour , which , as many of you know , has been very non - controversial -- -- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie . 
In closing , I 'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way . 
And all the people in this room have done so through their business lives , or their philanthropic work , or their other interests . 
And one thing that I 've learned is that there 's never one right way to make change . 
One can do it as a tech person , or as a finance person , or a nonprofit person , or as an entertainment person , but every one of us is all of those things and more . 
And I believe if we do these things , we can close the opportunity gaps , we can close the hope gaps . 
And I can imagine , if we do this , the headlines in 10 years might read something like these : " New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero , " " U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil " -- -- " Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate 10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence . " 
And I like this one , " Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro . " 
And finally , an eBay listing for one well - traveled slide show , now obsolete , museum piece . Please contact Al Gore . 
And I believe that , working together , we can make all of these things happen . 
And I want to thank you all for having me here today . 
It 's been a real honor . Thank you . 
Oh , thank you .

For the last eight years , pop singer Annie Lennox has devoted the majority of her time to her SING campaign , raising awareness and money to combat HIV / AIDS . She shares the experiences that have inspired her , from working with Nelson Mandela to meeting a little African girl in a desperate situation .

Annie Lennox : Why I am an HIV / AIDS activist 
I 'm going to share with you the story as to how I have become an HIV / AIDS campaigner . 
And this is the name of my campaign : SING Campaign . 
In November of 2003 , I was invited to take part in the launch of Nelson Mandela 's 46664 Foundation -- that is his HIV / AIDS foundation . 
And 46664 is the number that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island . 
And that 's me with Youssou N'Dour , onstage , having the time of my life . 
The next day , all the artists were invited to join Mandela in Robben Island , where he was going to give a conference to the world 's press , standing in front of his former prison cell . 
You can see the bars of the window there . 
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us . 
In that moment in time , Mandela told the world 's press that there was a virtual genocide taking place in his country ; that post - apartheid Rainbow Nation , a thousand people were dying on a daily basis and that the front line victims , the most vulnerable of all , were women and children . 
This was a huge impact on my mind , because I am a woman and I am a mother , and I had n't realized that the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly affecting women in such a way . 
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa , when I left Capetown , I told myself , " This is going to be something that I have to talk about . 
I have to serve . " 
And so , subsequently I participated in every single 46664 event that I could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to Mandela -- out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done . 
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela , everyone reveres Nelson Mandela . 
But do they all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his country , the country that had one of the highest incidents of transmission of the virus ? 
I think that if I went out into the street now and I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked . 
I was very , very fortunate a couple of years later to have met Zackie Achmat , the founder of Treatment Action Campaign , an incredible campaigner and activist . 
I met him at a 46664 event . 
He was wearing a t - shirt like the one I wear now . 
This is a tool -- this tells you I am in solidarity with people who have HIV , people who are living with HIV . 
And in a way because of the stigma , by wearing this t - shirt I say , " Yes , we can talk about this issue . 
It does n't have to be in the closet . " 
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign and I 'm very proud to be a member of that incredible organization . 
It 's a grassroots campaign with 80 percent membership being women , most of whom are HIV - positive . 
They work in the field . 
They have tremendous outreach to the people who are living directly with the effects of the virus . 
They have education programs . 
They bring out the issues of stigma . 
It 's quite extraordinary what they do . 
And yes , my SING Campaign has supported Treatment Action Campaign in the way that I have tried to raise awareness and to try to also raise funds . 
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa . 
So this is my SING Campaign . 
SING Campaign is basically just me and about three or four wonderful people who help to support me . 
I 've traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years -- I went to about 12 different countries . 
Here I am in Oslo in Norway , getting a nice , fat check ; singing in Hong Kong , trying to get people to raise money . 
In Johannesburg , I had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle - class South African audience who ended up in tears because I use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really do n't quite know what the solutions are . 
Aaron Motsoaledi , the current health minister , attended that concert and I had an opportunity to meet with him , and he gave his absolute commitment to try to making a change , which is absolutely necessary . 
This is in the Scottish Parliament . 
I 've subsequently become an envoy for Scotland and HIV . 
And I was showing them my experiences and trying to , again , raise awareness . 
And once again , in Edinburgh with the wonderful African Children 's Choir who I simply adore . 
And it 's children like this , many of whom have been orphaned because of their family being affected by the AIDS virus . 
I 'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe -- he 's the director of UNAIDS . 
And I 'm very honored by the fact that Michel invited me , only a few months ago , to become a UNAIDS ambassador . 
And in this way , I 've been strengthening my platform and broadening my outreach . 
The message that UNAIDS are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimination of the transmission of the virus from mother to child by 2015 . 
It 's a very ambitious goal but we believe it can be achieved with political will . 
This can happen . 
And here I am with a pregnant woman , who is HIV positive and we 're smiling , both of us are smiling , because we 're very confident , because we know that that young woman is receiving treatment so her life can be extended to take care of the baby she 's about to give birth to . 
And her baby will receive PMTCT , which will mean that that baby can be born free of the virus . 
Now that is prevention at the very beginning of life . 
It 's one way to start looking at intervention with the AIDS pandemic . 
Now , I just would like to finish off to tell you the little story about Avelile . 
This is Avelile -- she goes with me wherever I go . 
I tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of HIV / AIDS orphans . 
Avelile 's mother had HIV virus -- she died from AIDS - related illness . 
Avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus . 
And here she is at seven years old , weighing no more than a one year - old baby . 
At this point in her life , she 's suffering with full - blown AIDS and had pneumonia . 
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child . 
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal . 
They put her on very special nutritious diet and took great care of her . 
And we did n't know when we left the hospital -- because we filmed her story -- we did n't know if she was going to survive . 
So , it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter and left us feeling very resonant with this direct experience , this one child , you know , that story . 
Five months later , we went back to South Africa to meet Avelile again . 
And I 'm getting -- the hairs on my -- I do n't know if you can see the hairs on my arms . 
They 're standing up because I know what I 'm going to show you . 
This is the transformation that took place . 
Is n't it extraordinary ? 
That round of applause is actually for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile . 
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation . 
So , I would like to say to you , each one in the audience , if you feel that every mother and every child in the world has the right to have access to good nutrition and good medical care , and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals , specifically five and six , should be absolutely committed to by all governments around the world -- especially in sub - Saharan Africa -- could you please stand up . 
I think that 's fair to say , it 's almost everyone in the hall . 
Thank you very much .

In this powerful talk from TEDGlobal , Rebecca MacKinnon describes the expanding struggle for freedom and control in cyberspace , and asks : How do we design the next phase of the Internet with accountability and freedom at its core , rather than control ? She believes the internet is headed for a " Magna Carta " moment when citizens around the world demand that their governments protect free speech and their right to connection .

Rebecca MacKinnon : Let 's take back the Internet ! 
So I begin with an advertisement inspired by George Orwell that Apple ran in 1984 . 
Big Brother : We are one people with one will , one resolve , one cause . 
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own confusion . 
We shall prevail . 
Narrator : On January 24th , Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh . 
And you 'll see why 1984 wo n't be like " 1984 . " 
Rebecca MacKinnon : So the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today . 
Technology created by innovative companies will set us all free . 
Fast - forward more than two decades : Apple launches the iPhone in China and censors the Dalai Lama out along with several other politically sensitive applications at the request of the Chinese government for its Chinese app store . 
The American political cartoonist Mark Fiore also had his satire application censored in the United States because some of Apple 's staff were concerned it would be offensive to some groups . 
His app was n't reinstated until he won the Pulitzer Prize . 
The German magazine Stern , a news magazine , had its app censored because the Apple nannies deemed it to be a little bit too racy for their users , and despite the fact that this magazine is perfectly legal for sale on newsstands throughout Germany . 
And more controversially , recently , Apple censored a Palestinian protest app after the Israeli government voiced concerns that it might be used to organize violent attacks . 
So here 's the thing . 
We have a situation where private companies are applying censorship standards that are often quite arbitrary and generally more narrow than the free speech constitutional standards that we have in democracies . 
Or they 're responding to censorship requests by authoritarian regimes that do not reflect consent of the governed . 
Or they 're responding to requests and concerns by governments that have no jurisdiction over many , or most , of the users and viewers who are interacting with the content in question . 
So here 's the situation . 
In a pre - Internet world , sovereignty over our physical freedoms , or lack thereof , was controlled almost entirely by nation - states . 
But now we have this new layer of private sovereignty in cyberspace . 
And their decisions about software coding , engineering , design , terms of service all act as a kind of law that shapes what we can and can not do with our digital lives . 
And their sovereignties , cross - cutting , globally interlinked , can in some ways challenge the sovereignties of nation - states in very exciting ways , but sometimes also act to project and extend it at a time when control over what people can and can not do with information has more effect than ever on the exercise of power in our physical world . 
After all , even the leader of the free world needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan if he wants to get reelected next year . 
And these platforms were certainly very helpful to activists in Tunisia and Egypt this past spring and beyond . 
As Wael Ghonim , the Google - Egyptian - executive by day , secret - Facebook - activist by night , famously said to CNN after Mubarak stepped down , " If you want to liberate a society , just give them the Internet . " 
But overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated . 
On the left there 's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist who was part of the storming of the Egyptian state security offices in March . 
And many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles . 
But some of the files were left behind intact , and activists , some of them , found their own surveillance dossiers full of transcripts of their email exchanges , their cellphone text message exchanges , even Skype conversations . 
And one activist actually found a contract from a Western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the Egyptian security forces . 
And Egyptian activists are assuming that these technologies for surveillance are still being used by the transitional authorities running the networks there . 
And in Tunisia , censorship actually began to return in May -- not nearly as extensively as under President Ben Ali . 
But you 'll see here a blocked page of what happens when you try to reach certain Facebook pages and some other websites that the transitional authorities have determined might incite violence . 
In protest over this , blogger Slim Amamou , who had been jailed under Ben Ali and then became part of the transitional government after the revolution , he resigned in protest from the cabinet . 
But there 's been a lot of debate in Tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem . 
In fact , on Twitter , there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution who said , " Well actually , we do want democracy and free expression , but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off - bounds because it 's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy . 
But the problem is , how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions and how do you make sure that they do not abuse their power ? 
As Riadh Guerfali , the veteran digital activist from Tunisia , remarked over this incident , " Before , things were simple : you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other . 
Today , things are a lot more subtle . " 
Welcome to democracy , our Tunisian and Egyptian friends . 
The reality is that even in democratic societies today , we do not have good answers for how you balance the need for security and law enforcement on one hand and protection of civil liberties and free speech on the other in our digital networks . 
In fact , in the United States , whatever you may think of Julian Assange , even people who are not necessarily big fans of his are very concerned about the way in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks . 
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman , despite the fact that Wikileaks had not been charged , let alone convicted , of any crime . 
So we assume that the Internet is a border - busting technology . 
This is a map of social networks worldwide , and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing , depending on how you like the way Facebook manages its service . 
But borders do persist in some parts of cyberspace . 
In Brazil and Japan , it 's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons . 
But if you look at China , Vietnam and a number of the former Soviet states , what 's happening there is more troubling . 
You have a situation where the relationship between government and local social networking companies is creating a situation where , effectively , the empowering potential of these platforms is being constrained because of these relationships between companies and government . 
Now in China , you have the " great firewall , " as it 's well - known , that blocks Facebook and Twitter and now Google+ and many of the other overseas websites . 
And that 's done in part with the help from Western technology . 
But that 's only half of the story . 
The other part of the story are requirements that the Chinese government places on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet , known as a system of self - discipline . 
In plain English , that means censorship and surveillance of their users . 
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009 where the Internet Society of China presented awards to the top 20 Chinese companies that are best at exercising self - discipline -- i.e. policing their content . 
And Robin Li , CEO of Baidu , China 's dominant search engine , was one of the recipients . 
In Russia , they do not generally block the Internet and directly censor websites . 
But this is a website called Rospil that 's an anti - corruption site . 
And earlier this year , there was a troubling incident where people who had made donations to Rospil through a payments processing system called Yandex Money suddenly received threatening phone calls from members of a nationalist party who had obtained details about donors to Rospil through members of the security services who had somehow obtained this information from people at Yandex Money . 
This has a chilling effect on people 's ability to use the Internet to hold government accountable . 
So we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is mediated through the Internet , which is comprised primarily of privately owned and operated services . 
So the important question , I think , is not this debate over whether the Internet is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys . 
Of course , it 's going to empower whoever is most skilled at using the technology and best understands the Internet in comparison with whoever their adversary is . 
The most urgent question we need to be asking today is how do we make sure that the Internet evolves in a citizen - centric manner . 
Because I think all of you will agree that the only legitimate purpose of government is to serve citizens , and I would argue that the only legitimate purpose of technology is to improve our lives , not to manipulate or enslave us . 
So the question is , we know how to hold government accountable . 
We do n't necessarily always do it very well , but we have a sense of what the models are , politically and institutionally , to do that . 
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most CEO 's argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit ? 
And government regulation often is n't helping all that much . 
You have situations , for instance , in France where president Sarkozy tells the CEO 's of Internet companies , " We 're the only legitimate representatives of the public interest . " 
But then he goes and champions laws like the infamous " three - strikes " law that would disconnect citizens from the Internet for file sharing , which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression as being a disproportionate violation of citizens ' right to communications , and has raised questions amongst civil society groups about whether some political representatives are more interested in preserving the interests of the entertainment industry than they are in defending the rights of their citizens . 
And here in the United Kingdom there 's also concern over a law called the Digital Economy Act that 's placing more onus on private intermediaries to police citizen behavior . 
So what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen - centric Internet in the future , we need a broader and more sustained Internet freedom movement . 
After all , companies did n't stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course , or employing 10-year - olds as a matter of course , just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do . 
It was the result of decades of sustained activism , shareholder advocacy and consumer advocacy . 
Similarly , governments do n't enact intelligent environmental and labor laws just because politicians wake up one day . 
It 's the result of very sustained and prolonged political activism that you get the right regulations , and that you get the right corporate behavior . 
We need to make the same approach with the Internet . 
We also are going to need political innovation . 
Eight hundred years ago , approximately , the barons of England decided that the Divine Right of Kings was no longer working for them so well , and they forced King John to sign the Magna Carta , which recognized that even the king who claimed to have divine rule still had to abide by a basic set of rules . 
This set off a cycle of what we can call political innovation , which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed -- which was implemented for the first time by that radical revolutionary government in America across the pond . 
So now we need to figure out how to build consent of the networked . 
And what does that look like ? 
At the moment , we still do n't know . 
But it 's going to require innovation that 's not only going to need to focus on politics , on geopolitics , but it 's also going to need to deal with questions of business management , investor behavior , consumer choice and even software design and engineering . 
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world 's people and not the other way around . 
Thank you very much .

Misha Glenny investigates global crime networks 
These are grim economic times , fellow TEDsters , grim economic times indeed . 
And so , I would like to cheer you up with one of the great , albeit largely unknown , commercial success stories of the past 20 years . 
Comparable , in its own very peculiar way , to the achievements of Microsoft or Google . 
And it 's an industry which has bucked the current recession with equanimity . 
I refer to organized crime . 
Now organized crime has been around for a very long time , I hear you say , and these would be wise words , indeed . 
But in the last two decades , it has experienced an unprecedented expansion , now accounting for roughly 15 percent of the world 's GDP . 
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy , or McMafia , for short . 
So what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross - border crime ? 
Well , of course , there is globalization , technology , communications , all that stuff , which we 'll talk about a little bit later . 
But first , I would like to take you back to this event : the collapse of communism . 
All across Eastern Europe , a most momentous episode in our post - war history . 
Now it 's time for full disclosure . 
This event meant a great deal to me personally . 
I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe , like Solidarity in Poland , when I was in my teens . 
I then started writing about Eastern Europe , and eventually I became the BBC 's chief correspondent for the region , which is what I was doing in 1989 . 
And so when 425 million people finally won the right to choose their own governments , I was ecstatic , but I was also a touch worried about some of the nastier things lurking behind the wall . 
It was n't long , for example , before ethnic nationalism reared its bloody head in Yugoslavia . 
And amongst the chaos , amidst the euphoria , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989 , in Eastern Europe , continued to do so after the revolutions there . 
Obviously there were characters like this . 
But there were also some more unexpected people who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe . 
Like this character . Remember these guys ? 
They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting and wrestling , every four years in the Olympics , and they were the great celebrities of communism , with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it . 
They used to get great apartments in the center of town , casual sex on tap , and they could travel to the West very freely , which was a great luxury at the time . 
It may come as a surprise , but they played a critical role in the emergence of the market economy in Eastern Europe . 
Or as I like to call them , they are the midwives of capitalism . 
Here are some of those same weightlifters after their 1989 makeover . 
Now in Bulgaria -- this photograph was taken in Bulgaria -- when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe , it was n't just communism ; it was the state that collapsed as well . 
That means your police force was n't working . 
The court system was n't functioning properly . 
So what was a business man in the brave new world of East European capitalism going to do to make sure that his contracts would be honored ? 
Well , he would turn to people who were called , rather prosaically by sociologists , privatized law enforcement agencies . 
We prefer to know them as the mafia . 
And in Bulgaria , the mafia was soon joined with 14,000 people who were sacked from their jobs in the security services between 1989 and 1991 . 
Now , when your state is collapsing , your economy is heading south at a rate of knots , the last people you want coming on to the labor market are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills are surveillance , are smuggling , building underground networks and killing people . 
But that 's what happened all over Eastern Europe . 
Now , when I was working in the 1990s , I spent most of the time covering the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia . 
And I could n't help notice that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities , the paramilitary organizations , were actually the same people running the organized criminal syndicates . 
And I came to think that behind the violence lay a sinister criminal enterprise . 
And so I resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen , by talking to victims , by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services . 
But above all else , by talking to the gangsters themselves . 
And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start . 
Why ? Well of course there was the issue of law and order collapsing , but also , as they say in the retail trade , it 's location , location , location . 
And what I noticed at the beginning of my research that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world . 
Heroin , cocaine , women being trafficked into prostitution and precious minerals . 
And where were they heading ? 
The European Union , which by now was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization , transforming it into the most affluent consumer market in history , eventually comprising some 500 million people . 
And a significant minority of those 500 million people like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash sleeping with prostitutes , sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose and employing illegal migrant laborers . 
Now , organized crime in a globalizing world operates in the same way as any other business . 
It has zones of production , like Afghanistan and Columbia . 
It has zones of distribution , like Mexico and the Balkans . 
And then , of course , it has zones of consumption , like the European Union , Japan and of course , the United States . 
The zones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world , and they are often threatened by appalling violence and bloodshed . 
Take Mexico , for example . 
Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade . 
But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo ? 
Since 1998 , five million people have died there . 
It 's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers , but it 's the biggest conflict on this planet since the Second World War . 
And why is it ? Because mafias from all around the world cooperate with local paramilitaries in order to seize the supplies of the rich mineral resources of the region . 
In the year 2000 , 80 percent of the world 's coltan was sourced to the killing fields of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo . 
Now , coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone , in almost every laptop and games console . 
The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons , and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets . 
And it is this Western desire to consume that is the primary driver of international organized crime . 
Now , let me show you some of my friends in action , caught conveniently on film by the Italian police , and smuggling duty - not - paid cigarettes . 
Now , cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap . 
The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world . 
So if you can smuggle them into the E.U. , there are very handsome profits to be made , and I want to show you this to demonstrate the type of resources available to these groups . 
This boat is worth one million Euros when it 's new . 
And it 's the fastest thing on European waters . 
From 1994 , for seven years , 20 of these boats made the trip across the Adriatic , from Montenegro to Italy , every single night . 
And as a consequence of this trade , Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue . 
And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals . 
Now Italian police , when this trade started , had just two boats which could go at the same speed . 
And this is very important , because the only way you can catch these guys is if they run out of gas . 
Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them women being trafficked into prostitution , and if the police intervened , they would hurl the women into the sea so that the police had to go and save them from drowning , rather than chasing the bad guys . 
So I have shown you this to demonstrate how many boats , how many vessels it takes to catch one of these guys . 
And the answer is six vessels . 
And remember , 20 of these speed boats were coming across the Adriatic every single night . 
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making ? 
Well , this is where we come to globalization , because that was not just the deregulation of global trade . 
It was the liberalization of international financial markets . 
And boy , did that make it easy for the money launderers . 
The last two decades have been the champagne era for dirty lucre . 
In the 1990s , we saw financial centers around the world competing for their business , and there was simply no effective mechanism to prevent money laundering . 
And a lot of licit banks were also happy to accept deposits from very dubious sources without questions being asked . 
But at the heart of this , is the offshore banking network . 
Now these things are an essential part of the money laundering parade , and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion and transnational organized crime , money laundering , you have to get rid of them . 
On a positive note , we at last have someone in the White House who has consistently spoken out against these corrosive entities . 
And if anyone is concerned about what I believe is the necessity for new legislation , regulation , effective regulation , I say , let 's take a look at Bernie Madoff , who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail . 
Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars . 
That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters with the Colombian cartels and the major Russian crime syndicates , but he did this for decades in the very heart of Wall Street , and no regulator picked up on it . 
So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street or in the city of London , fleecing ordinary folk and money laundering ? 
Well I can tell you , it 's quite a few of them . 
Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now . 
And that is narcotics . Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning . 
This one , however , is in central British Columbia where I photographed it . 
It 's one of the tens of thousands of mom - and - pop grow - ops in B.C. 
which ensure that over five percent of the province 's GDP is accounted for by this trade . 
Now , I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera , of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the RCMP from the smugglers who are sending it , of course , down south to the United States where there is an insatiable market for B.C. Bud , as it 's called , in part because it 's marketed as organic , which of course goes down very well in California . 
Now , even by the police 's admission , this makes not a dent in the profits , really , of the major exporters . 
Since the beginning of globalization , the global narcotics market has expanded enormously . 
There has , however , been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces . 
This , however , may all be about to change , because something very strange is going on . 
The United Nations recognized earlier this -- it was last month actually -- that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs . 
Interestingly , the market share of heroin and cocaine is going down , because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs . 
Now that is a game changer , because it shifts production away from the developing world and into the Western world . 
When that happens , it is a trend which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West . 
The drugs policy which we 've had in place for 40 years is long overdue for a very serious rethink , in my opinion . 
Now , the recession . 
Well , organized crime has already adapted very well to the recession . 
Not surprising , the most opportunistic industry in the whole world . 
And it has no rules to its regulatory system . 
Except , of course , it has two business risks : arrest by law enforcement , which is , frankly , the least of their worries , and competition from other groups , i.e. a bullet in the back of the head . 
What they 've done is they 've shifted their operations . 
People do n't smoke as much dope , or visit prostitutes quite so frequently during a recession . 
And so instead , they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way , but above all , two sectors , and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime . 
And it 's been terribly successful . 
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle . 
Or perhaps I should say , more accurately , Señor Pringle . 
I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal . 
We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista in São Paulo , together . 
Hooked it up to my laptop , and within about five minutes he had penetrated the computer security system of a major Brazilian bank . 
It 's really not that difficult . 
And it 's actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it 's not so much the technology . 
The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering . 
Or to use the technical term for it , there 's one born every minute . 
You would not believe how easy it is to persuade people to do things with their computers which are objectively not in their interest . 
And it was very soon when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this , of course , the quickest way to a person 's wallet is through the promise of sex and love . 
I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus , one of the very great worldwide viruses that came . 
I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out , because the first person I received it from was an ex - girlfriend of mine . 
Now , she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time , but love was not amongst them . 
And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox , I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin and spared myself a very nasty infection . 
So , cybercrime , do watch out for it . 
One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing is the Internet is assisting these guys . 
These are mosquitoes who carry the malarial parasite which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal at our expense . 
Now , Artesunate is a very effective drug at destroying the parasite in the early days of infection . 
But over the past year or so , researchers in Cambodia have discovered that what 's happening is the malarial parasite is developing a resistance . 
And they fear that the reason why it 's developing a resistance is because Cambodians ca n't afford the drugs on the commercial market , and so they buy it from the Internet . 
And these pills contain only low doses of the active ingredient . 
Which is why the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance . 
The reason I say this is because we have to know that organized crime impacts all sorts of areas of our lives . 
You do n't have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime . 
They affect our bank accounts . 
They affect our communications , our pension funds . 
They even affect the food that we eat and our governments . 
This is no longer an issue of Sicilians from Palermo and New York . 
There is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st Century . 
This is a mighty industry , and it creates instability and violence wherever it goes . 
It is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seriously . 
It 's been a privilege talking to you . 
Thank you very much . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/elaine_morgan_says_we_evolved_from_aquatic_apes.html 
Elaine Morgan is a tenacious proponent of the aquatic ape hypothesis : the idea that humans evolved from primate ancestors who dwelt in watery habitats . Hear her spirited defense of the idea -- and her theory on why mainstream science does n't take it seriously . 
apes , evolution , science 
607 
Elaine Morgan says we evolved from aquatic apes 
Well , this is 2009 . 
And it 's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin . 
And all over the world , eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this . 
And what they 're planning to do is to enlighten us on almost every aspect of Darwin and his life , and how he changed our thinking . 
I say almost every aspect , because there is one aspect of this story which they have thrown no light on . 
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it and to talk about something else . 
So I 'm going to talk about it . 
It 's the question of , why are we so different from the chimpanzees ? 
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference , very , very closely related . 
And yet , when you look at the phenotypes , there 's a chimp , there 's a man ; they 're astoundingly different , no resemblance at all . 
I 'm not talking about airy - fairy stuff about culture or psychology , or behavior . 
I 'm talking about ground - base , nitty - gritty , measurable physical differences . 
They , that one , is hairy and walking on four legs . 
That one is a naked biped . Why ? 
I mean -- if I 'm a good Darwinist , I 've got to believe there 's a reason for that . 
If we changed so much , something must have happened . 
What happened ? 
Now 50 years ago , that was a laughably simple question . 
Everybody knew the answer . 
They knew what happened . 
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees ; our ancestors went out onto the plain . 
That explained everything . 
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass , or to chase after animals , or to free our hands for weapons . 
And we got so overheated in the chase that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away . 
Everybody knew that , for generations . 
But then , in the ' 90s , something began to unravel . 
The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids . 
And they were n't savanna species . 
And they looked at the herbivores . And they were n't savanna herbivores . 
And then they were so clever , they found a way to analyze fossilized pollen . 
Shock , horror . 
The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation . 
Some of it even came from lianas , those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle . 
So we 're left with a situation where we know that our earliest ancestors were moving around on four legs in the trees , before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence . 
This is not something I 've made up . 
It 's not a minority theory . 
Everybody agrees with it . 
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa and spoke to University College London . 
He said , " Everything I 've been telling you for the last 20 years , forget about it . It was wrong . 
We 've got to go back to square one and start again . " 
It made him very unpopular . They did n't want to go back to square one . 
I mean , it 's a terrible thing to happen . 
You 've got this beautiful paradigm . 
You 've believed it through generations . 
Nobody has questioned it . 
You 've been constructing fanciful things on top of it , relying on it to be as solid as a rock . 
And now it 's whipped away from under you . 
What do you do ? What does a scientist do in that case ? 
Well , we know the answer because Thomas S. Kuhn wrote a seminal treatise about this back in 1962 . 
He said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is , guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened . 
If they have n't got a paradigm they ca n't ask the question . 
So they say , " Yes it 's wrong , but supposing it was right ... " 
And the only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions . 
So that is what they have done now . 
That 's why you do n't hear them talking about it . It 's yesterday 's question . 
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle . 
It 's what we ought to be doing . 
Aaron Filler from Harvard said , " Is n't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures ? 
I mean , why do n't we talk about , well , there 's chromosomes , and there 's genes . 
And we just record what we see . " 
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave ! 
He knew all about that kind of science . 
And he called it hypothesis - free science . 
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart . 
And if you 're going to say , " I 'm going to stop talking about selective pressures , " you can take " The Origin of Species " and throw it out of the window , for it 's about nothing else but selective pressures . 
And the irony of it is , that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse where we did n't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up . 
There was one waiting in the wings . 
It had been waiting there since 1960 when Alister Hardy , a marine biologist , said , " I think what happened , perhaps our ancestors had a more aquatic existence for some of the time . " 
He kept it to himself for 30 years . 
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose . 
All his colleagues said , " This is outrageous . 
You 've exposed us to public ridicule ! 
You must never do that again . " 
And at that time , it became set in stone : the aquatic theory should be dumped with the UFOs and the yetis , as part of the lunatic fringe of science . 
Well I do n't think that . 
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him . 
I 'd like to talk about just a handful of what have been called the hallmarks of mankind , the things that made us different from everybody else , and all our relatives . 
Let 's look at our naked skin . 
It 's obvious that most of the things we think about that have lost their body hair , mammals without body hair , are aquatic ones , like the dugong , the walrus , the dolphin , the hippopotamus , the manatee . 
And a couple of wallowers - in - mud like the babirusa . 
And you 're tempted to think , well perhaps , could that be why we are naked ? 
I suggested it and people said , " No no no . 
I mean , look at the elephant . 
You 've forgotten all about the elephant have n't you ? " 
So back in 1982 I said , " Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor . " 
Peals of merry laughter ! 
" That crazy woman . She 's off again . She 'll say anything wo n't she ? " 
But by now , everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor . 
This has come ' round to be that all those naked pachyderms have aquatic ancestors . 
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros . 
Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros and said , " Seems to have spent most of its time in the water . " 
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water . 
As an absolute connection , it only works one way . 
You ca n't say all aquatic animals are naked , because look at the sea otter . 
But you can say that every animal that has become naked has been conditioned by water , in its own lifetime , or the lifetime of its ancestors . I think this is significant . 
The only exception is the naked Somalian mole - rat , which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground . 
And take bipedality . 
Here you ca n't find anybody to compare it with , because we 're the only animal that walks upright on two legs . 
But you can say this : all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs , if they want to , for a short time . 
There is only one circumstance in which they always , all of them , walk on two legs , and that is when they are wading through water . 
Do you think that 's significant ? 
David Attenborough thinks it 's significant , as the possible beginning of our bipedalism . 
Look at the fat layer . 
We have got , under our skin , a layer of fat , all over : nothing in the least like that in any other primate . 
Why should it be there ? 
Well they do know , that if you look at other aquatic mammals , the fat that in most land mammals is deposited inside the body wall , around the kidneys and the intestines and so on , has started to migrate to the outside , and spread out in a layer inside the skin . 
In the whale it 's complete : no fat inside at all , all in blubber outside . 
We can not avoid the suspicion that in our case it 's started to happen . 
We have got skin lined with this layer . 
It 's the only possible explanation of why humans , if they 're very unlucky , can become grossly obese , in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate , physically impossible . 
Something very odd , matter - of - factly , never explained . 
The question of why we can speak . 
We can speak . 
And the gorilla ca n't speak . Why ? 
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that -- purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath . 
You ca n't even train a gorilla to say " Ah " on request . 
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the diving birds . 
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak . 
And then again , there is the fact that we are streamlined . 
Trying to imagine a diver diving into water -- hardly makes a splash . 
Try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver , and you can see that , compared with gorilla , we are halfway to being shaped like a fish . 
I am trying to suggest that , for 40-odd years , this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe , and it is not lunatic fringe . 
And the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own , which they 've all agreed on , and they love . 
There is nothing there . 
They are staving off the aquatic theory to protect a vacuum . 
How do they react when I say these things ? 
One very common reaction I 've heard about 20 times is , " But it was investigated . 
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning , when Hardy put forward his article . " 
I do n't believe it . 
For 35 years I 've been looking for any evidence of any incident of that kind , and I 've concluded that that 's one of the urban myths . 
It 's never been done . 
I ask people sometimes , and they say , " I like the aquatic theory ! 
Everybody likes the aquatic theory . 
Of course they do n't believe it , but they like it . " 
Well I say , " Why do you think it 's rubbish ? " 
They say " Well ... 
everybody I talk to says it 's rubbish . 
And they ca n't all be wrong , can they ? " 
The answer to that , loud and clear , is , " Yes ! They can all be wrong . " 
History is strewn with the cases when they 've all got it wrong . 
And if you 've got a scientific problem like that , you ca n't solve it by holding a head count , and saying , " More of us say yes than say no . " 
Apart from that , some of the heads count more than others . 
Some of them have come over . 
There was Professor Tobias . He 's come over . 
Daniel Dennett , he 's come over . 
Sir David Attenborough , he 's come over . 
Anybody else out there ? Come on in . 
The water is lovely . 
And now we 've got to look to the future . 
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen . 
Either they will go on for the next 40 years , 50 years , 60 years . 
" Yeah well we do n't talk about that . Let 's talk about something interesting . " 
That would be very sad . 
The second thing that could happen is that some young genius will arrive , and say , " I 've found it . 
It was not the savanna , it was not the water , it was this ! " 
No sign of that happening either . 
I do n't think there is a third option . 
So the third thing that might happen is a very beautiful thing . 
If you look back at the early years of the last century , there was a stand - off , a lot of bickering and bad feeling between the believers in Mendel , and the believers in Darwin . 
It ended with a new synthesis : Darwin 's ideas and Mendel 's ideas blending together . 
And I think the same thing will happen here . 
You 'll get a new synthesis . 
Hardy 's ideas and Darwin 's ideas will be blended together . 
And we can move forward from there , and really get somewhere . 
That would be a beautiful thing . 
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon . 
Because I 'm older now than George Burns was when he said , " At my age , I do n't even buy green bananas . " 
So if it 's going to come and it 's going to happen , what 's holding it up ? 
I can tell you that in three words . 
Academia says no . 
They decided in 1960 , " That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis . " 
And it 's not easy to change their minds . 
The professional journals wo n't touch it with a barge pole . 
The textbooks do n't mention it . 
The syllabus does n't mention even the fact that we 're naked , let alone look for a reason to it . 
" Horizon , " which takes its cue from the academics , wo n't touch it with a barge pole . 
So we never hear the case put for it , except in jocular references to people on the lunatic fringe . 
I do n't know quite where this diktat comes from . 
Somebody up there is issuing the commandment , " Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory . 
And if you hope to make progress in this profession , and you do believe it , you 'd better keep it to yourself , because it will get in your way . " 
So I get the impression that some parts of the scientific establishment are morphing into a kind of priesthood . 
But you know , that makes me feel good , because Richard Dawkins has told us how to treat a priesthood . 
He says , " Firstly , you 've got to refuse to give it all the excessive awe and reverence it 's been trained to receive . " 
Right . I 'll go ahead with that . 
And secondly , he says , " You must never be afraid to rock the boat . " 
I 'll go along with that too . 
Thank you very much .

Ze Frank 's nerdcore comedy 
You know , when Chris first approached me to speak at TED , I said no , because I felt like I was n't going to be able to make that personal connection , you know , that I wanted to . 
It 's such a large conference . 
But he explained to me that he was in a bind , and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for -- so I said fine , Ted -- I mean Chris . I 'll come on two conditions . 
One -- I want to speak as early in the morning as possible . 
And two -- I want to pick the theme for TED 2006 . 
And luckily he agreed . And the theme , in two years , is going to be " Cute Pictures Of Puppies . " 
I invented the Placebo Camera . 
It does n't actually take pictures , but it 's a hell of a lot cheaper , and you still feel like you were there . 
" Dear Sir , Good day , compliments of the day , and my best wishes to you and family . I know this letter will come to you surprisingly , but let it not be a surprise to you , for nature has a way of arriving unannounced , and , as an adage says , originals are very hard to find , but their echoes sound louder . So I decided to contact you myself , for you to assure me of safety and honesty , if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody . 
I am Mister Michael Bangoora , the son of late Mister Tiamu Bangoora -- who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone -- but was killed during a civil war . 
Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment , and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business , on which premise I write you . 
Before my father death , he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars , which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war . 
This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country , before the outbreak of war . When the war broke out , the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him , my father insisted it was not in his possession , and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund . 
Meanwhile , my mother and I is the only person who knows about the fund because my father always confide in me . 
I quickly made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker , who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport , Freetown , although he did not know the real contents of the box . 
The fund was deposited as a family reassure , in a safe , reliable security company in Dakar , Senegal , where I was only given temporary asylum . 
I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate , and so close to my country . 
The only assistance I need from you , which I know you would do for me , are the following : one , be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust ; two , provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted ; three , receive the funds into your account in trust ; take out your commission ; and leave the rest of the money until I arrive , after the transfer is complete . 
Sincerely , Mister Michael Bangoora . " 
This is really embarrassing . 
I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes . 
I only prepared 15 . 
So if it 's cool , I 'd like to just wait for three . 
I 'm really sorry . 
What 's your name ? 
Mark Serfaas . It 's pretty cool , huh ? Pursuing happiness . 
Are you a virgin ? Virgin ? 
I mean -- no , I mean like in the TED sense ? 
Are you ? Oh , yeah . So what are you , like , a thousand , two thousand , somewhere in there ? Huh ? Oh ? 
You do n't know what I 'm talking about ? 
Ah , Mark -- Serfaas . 
1,860 -- am I good ? 
And that 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
That 's nothing to be ashamed of . 
Yeah , I was hanging out with some Google guys last night . 
Really cool , we were getting wasted . 
And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that , based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime , they can actually predict what you are going to say next . 
And I was like , " Get the fuck out of here . That 's crazy . " 
But they said , " No , but do n't show anyone , " but they slipped up . 
And they said that I could just type in " What was I going to say next ? " 
and my name , and it would tell me . And I have to tell you , right now , this is an unadulterated piece of software , this is a real Internet browser and this is an actual Google site , and we 're going to test it out live today . 
What was I going to say next ? And " Ze Frank " -- that 's me . 
Am I feeling lucky ? 
Am I feeling lucky ? 
Audience : Yes . 
Ze Frank : Oh . Amazing . 
In March of 2001 -- I filmed myself dancing to Madonna 's " Justify My Love . " 
On a Thursday , I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to 17 of my closest friends , as part of my -- an invitation to my -- an invitation to my th -- th -- 26th birthday party . 
By Monday , over a million people were coming to this site a day . 
Within a week , I received a call from Earthlink that said , due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge , I owed them 30,000 dollars . 
Needless to say , I was able to leave my job . 
And , finally , you know , become freelance . 
But some people refer to me more of -- as , like , an Internet guru or -- swami . 
I -- I knew I had something . 
I 'd basically distilled a very difficult - to - explain and complex philosophy , which I wo n't get into here , because it 's a little too deep for all of you , but -- it 's about what makes websites popular , and , you know , it 's -- it 's unfortunate that I do n't have more time . 
Maybe I can come back next year , or something like that . 
I 'm obsessed with email . I get a lot of it . 
Four years later , I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I do n't know , and it 's been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures , you know ? 
It 's like a microscope to the rest of the world . 
You can kind of peer into other people 's lives , and I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user . 
For example , somebody wrote me . 
They said , " Hey Ze , if you ever come to Boulder , you should rock out with us , " and I said , " Why wait ? " 
And they said , " Hey Ze , thanks for rocking out , but I meant the kind of rocking out where we 'd be naked . " 
And that was embarrassing . 
But you know , it 's kind of a collaboration between me and the fans , so I said , " Sure . " 
I hear a lot of you whispering . 
And I know what you 're saying . You 're saying , " Holy crap , how is his presentation so smooth ? " 
And I have to say that it 's not all me this year . 
I guess Chris has to take some credit here , because in years past , I guess there 's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED . I do n't know . 
And so , this year , Chris sent us a TED Conference simulator . 
Which really allowed us as speakers to get there , in the trenches , and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience . 
And I got ta say that , you know , it 's really , really great to be here . 
I 'd like to tell all of you a little joke . Not just the good stuff , though . 
You can do heckler mode . 
Voice : Hey , moron , get off the stage . 
ZF : You get off the stage . 
Voice : We want Malcolm Gladwell . 
In case you run over time . 
I 'd -- just one last thing I 'd like to say , I 'd , really -- like to thank all of you for being here . 
And frog mode . 
" Ah , the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp ... " 
It 's true . Some people say to me , they say , " Ze , you 're doing all this stuff , this Internet stuff , and you 're not making any money . 
" Why ? " And I say , " Mom , Dad -- " I 'm trying . " You know , I do n't know if you 're all aware of this , but the video -- the video game market , kids are playing these video games , oh , but , supposedly , there 's tons of money . 
I mean , like , I think , 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent on these things . So I decided to try my hand . 
I came up with a few games . 
This is called " Atheist . " 
I figured it 'd be popular with the young kids . 
Look , I 'll move around and say some things . 
So that did n't go over so well . 
I do n't really understand why you 're laughing . 
Should have done this before I tried to pitch it . 
" Buddhist , " of course , looks very , very similar to " Atheist . " 
But you come back as a duck . 
And this is great because , you know , for a quarter , you can play this for a long time . 
And Chris had said in an email that , you know , we should really bring something new to TED , something that we have n't shown anyone . 
So , I made this for TED . It 's " Christian . " 
It 's the third in the series . 
I 'm hoping it 's going to do well this year . 
Do you have a preference ? Good choice . 
So you can wait for the Second Coming -- which is -- a random number between one and 500 million . 
So really , what are we talking about here ? Oh , tech joy . 
Tech joy , to me , means something , because I get a lot of joy out of tech . 
And in fact , making things using technology -- and I 'm being serious here , even though I 'm using my sarcastic voice -- I wo n't -- hold on . Making things , you know -- making things actually does give me a lot of joy . 
It 's the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life , and it 's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do , but it 's not finished , and you 're not starting something -- that really fills my entire life . 
And so , what I 've done is , I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who do n't consider themselves artists . 
We 're in a culture of guru - ship . It 's so hard to use some software because , you know , it 's unapproachable , people feel like they have to read the manual . 
So I try to -- -- I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves , and , hopefully -- whoa , I 'm like -- on the page , but it does n't exist . 
It 's , like -- seriously , though -- I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves . 
Here I created a contest called , " When Office Supplies Attack , " which , I think , really resonated with the -- working population . 
Over 500 entries in three weeks , toilet paper fashion . 
Again , people from all over the country doing -- the watch is particularly incredible . 
Online drawing tools -- you 've probably seen a lot of them . 
I think they 're wonderful . 
I think it 's a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff . But I 'm interested in the process , the process of creating , as the real event that I 'm interested in . 
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing , and they get bummed out at this , sort of , you know , stick figure , awful little thing that they created . 
And eventually , it just makes them stop playing with it , or draw , you know , they draw penises and things like that . 
So , the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool . 
In other words , it 's a helping tool . 
You can draw your simple stick figure , and then it collaborates with you to create , sort of , like , a post - war German etching . 
So you can -- in fact , it 's tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse . So , we go ahead , and we start scribbling , and -- so the idea is that you can really , you know , partake in this process , but watch something really crappy look beautiful . 
And here are some of my favorites . This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me . Here we are , very cool . 
Darling . Beautiful stuff . 
I mean this is incredible . This is an 11-year - old girl -- drew this and submitted it . It 's just gorgeous . 
I 'm -- I 'm dead serious here . I 'm actually -- this is not a joke . 
But , I think , it 's a -- it 's a really fun and wonderful thing . 
So this is called the " Fiction Project . " This is an online space , which is -- it 's basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing . 
These are haikus . 
None of the haikus were written by the same person , and in fact , no line was -- you know , each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time . 
I think that the " now tied up , tied down , mistress cruel approaches me , now tied down , it 's up . " 
It 's -- it 's an amazing way , and I 'll tell you , if you come home , and your spouse , or whoever it is , says , " Let 's talk " -- that , like , chills you to the very core . 
But it 's peripheral activities , like these , that allow people to get together , doing fun things . 
They actually get to know each other , and it 's sort of like low - threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we 're lacking . And very , very quickly -- I love puppets . Here 's a puppet . 
It dances to music . Lotte Reiniger , an amazing shadow puppeteer in the ' 20s , that started doing more elaborate things . 
I became interested in puppets , and I just want to show one last thing to you . 
Oh , this is how you make puppets .

Politicians are strange creatures , says politician Omar Ahmad . And the best way to engage them on your pet issue is a monthly handwritten letter . Ahmad shows why old - fashioned correspondence is more effective than email , phone or even writing a check -- and shares the four simple steps to writing a letter that works .

Omar Ahmad : Political change with pen and paper 
One of the things that defines a TEDster is you 've taken your passion , and you 've turned it into stewardship . 
You actually put action to the issues you care about . 
But what you 're going to find eventually is you may need to actually get elected officials to help you out . 
So , how do you do that ? 
One of the things I should probably tell you is , I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career , and that sort of warped my framework . 
So , when you start to think about politicians , you 've got to realize these are strange creatures . 
Other than the fact that they ca n't tell directions , and they have very strange breeding habits , how do you actually work with these things ? 
What we need to understand is : What drives the political creature ? 
And there are two things that are primary in a politician 's heart : One is reputation and influence . 
These are the primary tools by which a politician can do his job . 
The second one -- unlike most animals , which is survival of the species -- this is preservation of self . 
Now you may think it 's money , but that 's actually sort of a proxy to what I can do to preserve myself . 
Now , the challenge with you moving your issue forward is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time . 
So , what does n't work , in terms of getting your issue to be important ? 
You can send them an email . 
Well , unfortunately , I 've got so many Viagra ads coming at me , your email is lost . 
It does n't matter , it 's spam . 
How about you get on the phone ? 
Well , chances are I 've got a droid who 's picking up the phone , " Yes , they called , and they said they did n't like it . " 
That does n't move . 
Face to face would work , but it 's hard to set it up . 
It 's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work . 
Yes , contributions actually do make a difference and they set a context for having a conversation , but it takes some time to build up . 
So what actually works ? 
And the answer is rather strange . 
It 's a letter . 
We live in a digital world , but we 're fairly analog creatures . 
Letters actually work . 
Even the top dog himself takes time every day to read 10 letters that are picked out by staff . 
I can tell you that every official that I 've ever worked with will tell you about the letters they get and what they mean . 
So , how are you going to write your letter ? 
First of all , you 're going to pick up an analog device : a pen . 
I know these are tough , and you may have a hard time getting your hand bent around it , but this is actually critical . 
And it is critical that you actually handwrite your letter . 
It is so novel to see this , that somebody actually picked up an analog device and has written to me . 
Second of all , I 'm going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month . 
Here 's my promise to you : If you are consistent and do this , within three months the elected official will start calling you when that issue comes up and say , " What do you think ? " 
Now , I 'm going to give you a four paragraph format to work with . 
Now , when you approach these animals , you need to understand there 's a dangerous end to them , and you also need to approach them with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness . 
So in paragraph number one , what I 'm going to tell you to do is very simply this : You appreciate them . 
You may not appreciate the person , you may not appreciate anything else , but maybe you appreciate the fact that they 've got a tough gig . 
When animals are going to make a point , they make the point . 
They do n't spend a lot of time dicking around . 
So , here you go . 
Paragraph number two : You may actually have to just get very blunt and say what 's really on your mind . 
When you do this , do n't attack people ; you attack tactics . 
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere . 
Paragraph number three : When animals are attacked or cornered , they will fight to the death , so you have to give them an exit . 
Most of the time , if they have an exit strategy , they should take it . 
" Obviously , you 're intelligent . 
If you had the right information , you would have done the right thing . " 
Lastly , you want to be the nurturing agent . 
You 're the safe place to come in to . 
So , in paragraph number four , you 're going to tell people , " If no one is providing you with this information , let me help . " 
Animals do displays . They do two things : They warn you or they try to attract you and say , " We need to mate . " 
You 're going to do that by the way you sign your letter . 
You do a number of things : you 're a vice president , you volunteer , you do something else . 
Why is is this important ? 
Because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature : that you have influence in a large sphere , and that my preservation depends on you . 
Here is one very quick hack , especially for the feds in the audience . 
Here 's how you mail your letter . 
First of all , you send the original to the district office . 
So , you send the copy to the main office . 
If they follow protocol , they 'll pick up the phone and say , " Hey , do you have the original ? " 
Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler and says , " Oh , this is an important letter . " 
And you actually get into the folder that the elected official actually has to read . 
So , what your letter means : I 've got to tell you , we are all in a party , and political officials are the pinatas . 
We are harangued , lectured to , sold , marketed , but a letter is actually one of the few times that we have honest communication . 
I got this letter when I was first elected , and I still carry it to every council meeting I go to . 
This is an opportunity at real dialogue , and if you have stewardship and want to communicate , that dialogue is incredibly powerful . 
So when you do that , here 's what I can promise : You 're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest . 
Get writing .

Kate Hartman : The art of wearable communication 
My name is Kate Hartman . 
And I like to make devices that play with the ways that we relate and communicate . 
So I 'm specifically interested in how we , as humans , relate to ourselves , each other and the world around us . 
So just to give you a bit of context , as June said , I 'm an artist , a technologist and an educator . 
I teach courses in physical computing and wearable electronics . 
And much of what I do is either wearable or somehow related to the human form . 
And so anytime I talk about what I do , I like to just quickly address the reason why bodies matter . 
And it 's pretty simple . 
Everybody 's got one -- all of you . 
I can guarantee , everyone in this room , all of you over there , the people in the cushy seats , the people up top with the laptops -- we all have bodies . 
Do n't be ashamed . 
It 's something that we have in common and they act as our primary interfaces for the world . 
And so when working as an interaction designer , or as an artist who deals with participation -- creating things that live on , in or around the human form -- it 's really a powerful space to work within . 
So within my own work , I use a broad range of materials and tools . 
So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers to funnels and plastic tubing . 
And to tell you a bit about the things that I make , the easiest place to start the story is with a hat . 
And so it all started several years ago , late one night when I was sitting on the subway , riding home , and I was thinking . 
And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little . 
And so I was thinking about how it might be great if I could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if I could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that I could share them with somebody else . 
And so I went home , and I made a prototype of this hat . 
And I called it the Muttering Hat , because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you , but you could detach them and share them with somebody else . 
So I make other hats as well . 
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat . 
It 's fairly self - explanatory . 
It physically carves out conversation space for one . 
And when you speak out loud , the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears . 
And so when I make these things , it 's really not so much about the object itself , but rather the negative space around the object . 
So what happens when a person puts this thing on ? 
What kind of an experience do they have ? 
And how are they transformed by wearing it ? 
So many of these devices really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves . 
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener . 
And it is a tool that actually enables one to listen to their own innards . 
And so some of these things are actually more geared toward expression and communication . 
And so the Inflatable Heart is an external organ that can be used by the wearer to express themselves . 
So they can actually inflate it and deflate it according to their emotions . 
So they can express everything from admiration and lust to anxiety and angst . 
And some of these are actually meant to mediate experiences . 
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments . 
And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange , but is serves to absorb the specificity of the words that are delivered . 
And in the end , some of these things just act as invitations . 
So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there so someone can grab your ear and say what they have to say . 
So even though I 'm really interested in the relationship between people , I also consider the ways in which we relate to the world around us . 
And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back , I was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how I would like to better relate to them . 
And I thought , " Well , hey ! 
Maybe if I want to better relate to walls , maybe I need to be more wall - like myself . " 
So I made a wearable wall that I could wear as a backpack . 
And so I would put it on and sort of physically transform myself so that I could either contribute to or critique the spaces that surrounded me . 
And so jumping off of that , thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world , I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls -- which actually enables houseplants to tap into human communication protocols . 
So when a plant is thirsty , it can actually make a phone call or post a message to a service like Twitter . 
And so this really shifts the human / plant dynamic , because a single house plant can actually express its needs to thousands of people at the same time . 
And so kind of thinking about scale , my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course . 
And so glaciers are these magnificent beings , and there 's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them , but what I 'm particularly interested in is in human - glacier relations . 
Because there seems to be an issue . 
The glaciers are actually leaving us . 
They 're both shrinking and retreating -- and some of them have disappeared altogether . 
And so I actually live in Canada now , so I 've been visiting one of my local glaciers . 
And this one 's particularly interesting , because , of all the glaciers in North America , it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year . 
They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine and drop people off on the surface of the glacier . 
And this has really gotten me thinking about this experience of the initial encounter . 
When I meet a glacier for the very first time , what do I do ? 
There 's no kind of social protocol for this . 
I really just do n't even know how to say hello . 
Do I carve a message in the snow ? 
Or perhaps I can assemble one out of dot and dash ice cubes -- ice cube Morse code . 
Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool , like an icy megaphone that I can use to amplify my voice when I direct it at the ice . 
But really the most satisfying experience I 've had is the act of listening , which is what we need in any good relationship . 
And I was really struck by how much it affected me . 
This very basic shift in my physical orientation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the glacier . 
And so since we use devices to figure out how to relate to the world these days , I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit . 
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice . 
And once again , it 's this invitation that asks people to lay down on the glacier and give it a hug . 
So , yea , this is actually just the beginning . 
These are initial musings for this project . 
And just as with the wall , how I wanted to be more wall - like , with this project , I 'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace . 
And so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where I work with people from different disciplines -- artists , technologists , scientists -- to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human - glacier relations . 
So beyond that , in closing , I 'd just like to say that we 're in this era of communications and device proliferation , and it 's really tremendous and exciting and sexy , but I think what 's really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world . 
Thanks .

Venice is sinking . To save it , Rachel Armstrong says we need to outgrow architecture made of inert materials and , well , make architecture that grows itself . She proposes a not - quite - alive material that does its own repairs and sequesters carbon , too .

Rachel Armstrong : Architecture that repairs itself ? 
All buildings today have something in common . 
They 're made using Victorian technologies . 
This involves blueprints , industrial manufacturing and construction using teams of workers . 
All of this effort results in an inert object . 
And that means that there is a one - way transfer of energy from our environment into our homes and cities . 
This is not sustainable . 
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities is by connecting them to nature , not insulating them from it . 
Now , in order to do this , we need the right kind of language . 
Living systems are in constant conversation with the natural world , through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism . 
And this is the conversion of one group of substances into another , either through the production or the absorption of energy . 
And this is the way in which living materials make the most of their local resources in a sustainable way . 
So , I 'm interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture . 
But they do n't exist . So I 'm having to make them . 
I 'm working with architect Neil Spiller at the Bartlett School of Architecture , and we 're collaborating with international scientists in order to generate these new materials from a bottom up approach . 
That means we 're generating them from scratch . 
One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc , and he 's really interested in the transition from inert to living matter . 
Now , that 's exactly the kind of process that I 'm interested in , when we 're thinking about sustainable materials . 
So , Martin , he works with a system called the protocell . 
Now all this is -- and it 's magic -- is a little fatty bag . And it 's got a chemical battery in it . 
And it has no DNA . 
This little bag is able to conduct itself in a way that can only be described as living . 
It is able to move around its environment . 
It can follow chemical gradients . 
It can undergo complex reactions , some of which are happily architectural . 
So here we are . These are protocells , patterning their environment . 
We do n't know how they do that yet . 
Here , this is a protocell , and it 's vigorously shedding this skin . 
Now , this looks like a chemical kind of birth . 
This is a violent process . 
Here , we 've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate . 
And that 's the shell around that globular fat . 
They are quite brittle . So you 've only got a part of one there . 
So what we 're trying to do is , we 're trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom - up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , Victorian , top - down methods which impose structure upon matter . 
That ca n't be energetically sensible . 
So , bottom - up materials actually exist today . 
They 've been in use , in architecture , since ancient times . 
If you walk around the city of Oxford , where we are today , and have a look at the brickwork , which I 've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days , you 'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone . 
And if you look even closer , you 'll see , in that limestone , there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other . 
And then they are fossilized over millions of years . 
Now a block of limestone , in itself , is n't particularly that interesting . 
It looks beautiful . 
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be if the surfaces were actually in conversation with the atmosphere . 
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide . 
Would it give this block of limestone new properties ? 
Well , most likely it would . It might be able to grow . 
It might be able to self - repair , and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment . 
So , architects are never happy with just one block of an interesting material . 
They think big . Okay ? 
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials , we can start thinking about ecological interventions like repair of atolls , or reclamation of parts of a city that are damaged by water . 
So , one of these examples would of course be the historic city of Venice . 
Now , Venice , as you know , has a tempestuous relationship with the sea , and is built upon wooden piles . 
So we 've devised a way by which it may be possible for the protocell technology that we 're working with to sustainably reclaim Venice . 
And architect Christian Kerrigan has come up with a series of designs that show us how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef underneath the city . 
So , here is the technology we have today . 
This is our protocell technology , effectively making a shell , like its limestone forefathers , and depositing it in a very complex environment , against natural materials . 
We 're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this . 
Now , this is the very interesting part . 
We do n't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals . 
What we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles . 
So , you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually moving away from the light , toward the dark foundations . 
We 've observed this in the laboratory . 
The protocells can actually move away from the light . 
They can actually also move towards the light . You have to just choose your species . 
So that these do n't just exist as one entity , we kind of chemically engineer them . 
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone very specifically , around the foundations of Venice , effectively petrifying it . 
Now , this is n't going to happen tomorrow . It 's going to take a while . 
It 's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology in order for us to become ready to test it out in a case - by - case basis on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice . 
But gradually , as the buildings are repaired , we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city . 
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide . 
Also it will attract the local marine ecology , who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture . 
So , this is really interesting . Now we have an architecture that connects a city to the natural world in a very direct and immediate way . 
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere . 
This is terrestrial chemistry . We 've all got it , which means that this technology is just as appropriate for developing countries as it is for First World countries . 
So , in summary , I 'm generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies , and building architectures from a bottom - up approach . 
Secondly , these metabolic materials have some of the properties of living systems , which means they can perform in similar ways . 
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions within the practice of architecture . 
And finally , an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one . 
Thank you .

Sebastian Thrun helped build Google 's amazing driverless car , powered by a very personal quest to save lives and reduce traffic accidents . Jawdropping video shows the DARPA Challenge - winning car motoring through busy city traffic with no one behind the wheel , and dramatic test drive footage from TED2011 demonstrates how fast the thing can really go .

Sebastian Thrun : Google 's driverless car 
As a boy , I loved cars . 
When I turned 18 , I lost my best friend to a car accident . 
Like this . 
And then I decided I 'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year . 
Now I have n't succeeded , so this is just a progress report , but I 'm here to tell you a little bit about self - driving cars . 
I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self - driving car that could navigate a desert . 
And even though a hundred teams were there , these cars went nowhere . 
So we decided at Stanford to build a different self - driving car . 
We built the hardware and the software . 
We made it learn from us , and we set it free in the desert . 
And the unimaginable happened : it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge , winning Stanford 2 million dollars . 
Yet I still had n't saved a single life . 
Since , our work has focused on building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves -- any street in California . 
We 've driven 140,000 miles . 
Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving . 
It 's the perfect driving mechanism . 
We 've driven in cities , like in San Francisco here . 
We 've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1 . 
We 've encountered joggers , busy highways , toll booths , and this is without a person in the loop ; the car just drives itself . 
In fact , while we drove 140,000 miles , people did n't even notice . 
Mountain roads , day and night , and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco . 
Sometimes our cars get so crazy , they even do little stunts . 
Man : Oh , my God . 
What ? 
Second Man : It 's driving itself . 
Sebastian Thrun : Now I ca n't get my friend Harold back to life , but I can do something for all the people who died . 
Do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people ? 
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error , and can therefore be prevented by machines ? 
Do you realize that we could change the capacity of highways by a factor of two or three if we did n't rely on human precision on staying in the lane -- improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a little bit narrower lanes , and do away with all traffic jams on highways ? 
Do you realize that you , TED users , spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic , wasting your time on your daily commute ? 
You could regain this time . 
This is four billion hours wasted in this country alone . 
And it 's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted . 
Now I think there 's a vision here , a new technology , and I 'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars . 
Thank you .

With streams and rivers drying up because of over - usage , Rob Harmon has implemented an ingenious market mechanism to bring back the water . Farmers and beer companies find their fates intertwined in the intriguing century - old tale of Prickly Pear Creek .

1093 
Rob Harmon : How the market can keep streams flowing 
This is a river . 
This is a stream . 
This is a river . 
This is happening all over the country . 
There are tens of thousands of miles of dewatered streams in the United States . 
On this map , the colored areas represent water conflicts . 
Similar problems are emerging in the east as well . 
The reasons vary state to state , but mostly in the details . 
There are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in Montana alone . 
They would ordinarily support fish and other wildlife . 
They 're the veins of the ecosystem , and they 're often empty veins . 
I want to tell you the story of just one of these streams because it 's an archetype for the larger story . 
This is Prickly Pear Creek . 
It runs through a populated area from East Helena to Lake Helena . 
It supports wild fish including cutthroat , brown and rainbow trout . 
Nearly every year for more than a hundred years , it 's looked like this in the summer . 
How did we get here ? 
Well , it started back in the late 1800s when people started settling in places like Montana . 
In short , there was a lot of water and there were n't very many people . 
But as more people showed up wanting water , the folks who were there first got a little concerned , and in 1865 , Montana passed its first water law . 
It basically said , everybody near the stream can share in the stream . 
Oddly , a lot of people showed up wanting to share the stream , and the folks who were there first got concerned enough to bring out their lawyers . 
There were precedent - setting suits in 1870 and 1872 , both involving Prickly Pear Creek . 
And in 1921 , the Montana Supreme Court ruled in a case involving Prickly Pear that the folks who were there first had the first , or " senior water rights . " 
These senior water rights are key . 
The problem is that all over the west now it looks like this . 
Some of these creeks have claims for 50 to 100 times more water than is actually in the stream . 
And the senior water rights holders , if they do n't use their water right , they risk losing their water right , along with the economic value that goes with it . 
So they have no incentive to conserve . 
So it 's not just about the number of people ; the system itself creates a disincentive to conserve because you can lose your water right if you do n't use it . 
So after decades of lawsuits and 140 years , now , of experience , we still have this . 
It 's a broken system . 
There 's a disincentive to conserve , because , if you do n't use your water right , you can lose your water right . 
And I 'm sure you all know , this has created significant conflicts between the agricultural and environmental communities . 
Okay . Now I 'm going to change gears here . 
Most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation 's free , and some of you 'll be happy to know that it involves beer . 
There 's another thing happening around the country , which is that companies are starting to get concerned about their water footprint . 
They 're concerned about securing an adequate supply of water , they 're trying to be really efficient with their water use , and they 're concerned about how their water use affects the image of their brand . 
Well , it 's a national problem , but I 'm going to tell you another story from Montana , and it involves beer . 
I bet you did n't know , it takes about 5 pints of water to make a pint of beer . 
If you include all the drain , it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer . 
Now the brewers in Montana have already done a lot to reduce their water consumption , but they still use millions of gallons of water . 
I mean , there 's water in beer . 
So what can they do about this remaining water footprint that can have serious effects on the ecosystem ? 
These ecosystems are really important to the Montana brewers and their customers . 
After all , there 's a strong correlation between water and fishing , and for some , there 's a strong correlation between fishing and beer . 
So the Montana brewers and their customers are concerned , and they 're looking for some way to address the problem . 
So how can they address this remaining water footprint ? 
Remember Prickly Pear . 
Up until now , business water stewardship has been limited to measuring and reducing , and we 're suggesting that the next step is to restore . 
Remember Prickly Pear . 
It 's a broken system . 
You 've got a disincentive to conserve , because if you do n't use your water right , you risk losing your water right . 
Well , we decided to connect these two worlds -- the world of the companies with their water footprints and the world of the farmers with their senior water rights on these creeks . 
In some states , senior water rights holders can leave their water in - stream while legally protecting it from others and maintaining their water right . 
After all , it is their water right , and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream , it 's their right to do so . 
But they have no incentive to do so . 
So , working with local water trusts , we created an incentive to do so . 
We pay them to leave their water in - stream . 
That 's what 's happening here . 
This individual has made the choice and is closing this water diversion , leaving the water in the stream . 
He does n't lose the water right , he just chooses to apply that right , or some portion of it , to the stream , instead of to the land . 
Because he 's the senior water rights holder , he can protect the water from other users in the stream . 
Okay ? 
He gets paid to leave the water in the stream . 
This guy 's measuring the water that this leaves in the stream . 
We then take the measured water , we divide it into thousand - gallon increments . 
Each increment gets a serial number and a certificate , and then the brewers and others buy those certificates as a way to return water to these degraded ecosystems . 
The brewers pay to restore water to the stream . 
It provides a simple , inexpensive and measurable way to return water to these degraded ecosystems , while giving farmers an economic choice and giving businesses concerned about their water footprints an easy way to deal with them . 
After 140 years of conflict and 100 years of dry streams , a circumstance that litigation and regulation has not solved , we put together a market - based , willing buyer , willing seller solution -- a solution that does not require litigation . 
It 's about giving folks concerned about their water footprints a real opportunity to put water where it 's critically needed , into these degraded ecosystems , while at the same time providing farmers a meaningful economic choice about how their water is used . 
These transactions create allies , not enemies . 
They connect people rather than dividing them . 
And they provide needed economic support for rural communities . 
And most importantly , it 's working . 
We 've returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems . 
We 've connected senior water rights holders with brewers in Montana , with hotels and tea companies in Oregon and with high - tech companies that use a lot of water in the Southwest . 
And when we make these connections , we can and we do turn this into this . 
Thank you very much .

Chade - Meng Tan : Everyday compassion at Google 
So what does the happiest man in the world look like ? 
He certainly does n't look like me . 
He looks like this . 
His name is Matthieu Ricard . 
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world ? 
Well it turns out there is a way to measure happiness in the brain . 
And you do that by measuring the relative activation of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI , versus the right prefrontal cortex . 
And Matthieu 's happiness measure is off the charts . 
He 's by far the happiest man ever measured by science . 
Which leads us to a question : What was he thinking when he was being measured ? 
Perhaps something very naughty . 
Actually , he was meditating on compassion . 
Matthieu 's own experience is that compassion is the happiest state ever . 
Reading about Matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life . 
My dream is to create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime -- and to do that by creating the conditions for inner peace and compassion on a global scale . 
And learning about Matthieu gave me a new angle to look at my work . 
Matthieu 's brain scan shows that compassion is not a chore . 
Compassion is something that creates happiness . 
Compassion is fun . 
And that mind - blowing insight changes the entire game . 
Because if compassion was a chore , nobody 's going to do it , except maybe the Dalai Lama or something . 
But if compassion was fun , everybody 's going to do it . 
Therefore , to create the conditions for global compassion , all we have to do is to reframe compassion as something that is fun . 
But fun is not enough . 
What if compassion is also profitable ? 
What if compassion is also good for business ? 
Then , every boss , every manager in the world , will want to have compassion -- like this . 
That would create the conditions for world peace . 
So , I started paying attention to what compassion looks like in a business setting . 
Fortunately , I did n't have to look very far . 
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes -- in Google , my company . 
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world , but Google is the place I 'm familiar with because I 've been there for 10 years , so I 'll use Google as the case study . 
Google is a company born of idealism . 
It 's a company that thrives on idealism . 
And maybe because of that , compassion is organic and widespread company - wide . 
In Google , expressions of corporate compassion almost always follow the same pattern . 
It 's sort of a funny pattern . 
It starts with a small group of Googlers taking the initiative to do something . 
And they do n't usually ask for permission ; they just go ahead and do it , and then other Googlers join in , and it just gets bigger and bigger . 
And sometimes it gets big enough to become official . 
So in other words , it almost always starts from the bottom up . 
And let me give you some examples . 
The first example is the largest annual community event -- where Googlers from around the world donate their labor to their local communities -- was initiated and organized by three employees before it became official , because it just became too big . 
Another example , three Googlers -- a chef , an engineer and , most funny , a massage therapist -- three of them , they learned about a region in India where 200,000 people live without a single medical facility . 
So what do they do ? 
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser . 
And they raise enough money to build this hospital -- the first hospital of its kind for 200,000 people . 
During the Haiti earthquake , a number of engineers and product managers spontaneously came together and stayed overnight to build a tool to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones . 
And expressions of compassion are also found in our international offices . 
In China for example , one mid - level employee initiated the largest social action competition in China , involving more than 1,000 schools in China , working on issues such as education , poverty , health care and the environment . 
There is so much organic social action all around Google that the company decided to form a social responsibility team just to support these efforts . 
And this idea , again , came from the grassroots , from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions and volunteered themselves for the job . 
And I found it fascinating that the social responsibility team was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy . 
It was two persons saying , " Let 's do this , " and the company said , " Yes . " 
So it turns out that Google is a compassionate company , because Googlers found compassion to be fun . 
But again , fun is not enough . 
There are also real business benefits . 
So what are they ? 
The first benefit of compassion is that it creates highly effective business leaders . 
What does that mean ? 
There are three components of compassion . 
There is the affective component , which is , " I feel for you . " 
There is the cognitive component , which is , " I understand you . " 
And there is a motivational component , which is , " I want to help you . " 
So what has this got to do with business leadership ? 
According to a very comprehensive study led by Jim Collins , and documented in the book " Good to Great , " it takes a very special kind of leader to bring a company from goodness to greatness . 
And he calls them " Level 5 leaders . " 
These are leaders who , in addition to being highly capable , possess two important qualities , and they are humility and ambition . 
These are leaders who are highly ambitious for the greater good . 
And because they 're ambitious for a greater good , they feel no need to inflate their own egos . 
And they , according to the research , make the best business leaders . 
And if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion , we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits , tones down , what I call the excessive self - obsession that 's in us , therefore creating the conditions for humility . 
The motivational component of compassion creates ambition for greater good . 
In other words , compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders . 
And this is the first compelling business benefit . 
The second compelling benefit of compassion is that it creates an inspiring workforce . 
Employees mutually inspire each other towards greater good . 
It creates a vibrant , energetic community where people admire and respect each other . 
I mean , you come to work in the morning , and you work with three guys who just up and decide to build a hospital in India . 
It 's like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers ? 
So this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration , initiative and creativity . 
It makes us a highly effective company . 
So , having said all that , what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting ? 
In our experience , there are three ingredients . 
The first ingredient is to create a culture of passionate concern for the greater good . 
So always think : how is your company and your job serving the greater good ? 
Or , how can you further serve the greater good ? 
This awareness of serving the greater good is very self - inspiring and it creates fertile ground for compassion to grow in . 
That 's one . 
The second ingredient is autonomy . 
So in Google , there 's a lot of autonomy . 
And one of our most popular managers jokes that , this is what he says , " Google is a place where the inmates run the asylum . " 
And he considers himself one of the inmates . 
If you already have a culture of compassion and idealism and you let your people roam free , they will do the right thing in the most compassionate way . 
The third ingredient is to focus on inner development and personal growth . 
Leadership training in Google , for example , places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities , such as self - awareness , self - mastery , empathy and compassion , because we believe that leadership begins with character . 
We even created a seven - week curriculum on emotion intelligence , which we jokingly call " Searching Inside Yourself . " 
It 's less naughty than it sounds . 
So I 'm an engineer by training , but I 'm one of the creators and instructors of this course , which I find kind of funny , because this is a company that trusts an engineer to teach emotion intelligence . 
What a company . 
So " Search Inside Yourself " -- how does it work ? 
It works in three steps . 
The first step is attention training . 
Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities . 
Therefore , any curriculum for training emotion intelligence has to begin with attention training . 
The idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time . 
And this creates the foundation for emotion intelligence . 
The second step follows the first step . 
The second step is developing self - knowledge and self - mastery . 
So using the supercharged attention from step one , we create a high - resolution perception into the cognitive and emotive processes . 
What does that mean ? 
It means being able to observe our thought stream and the process of emotion with high clarity , objectivity and from a third - person perspective . 
And once you can do that , you create the kind of self - knowledge that enables self - mastery . 
The third step , following the second step , is to create new mental habits . 
What does that mean ? Imagine this . 
Imagine whenever you meet any other person , any time you meet a person , your habitual , instinctive first thought is , " I want you to be happy . 
I want you to be happy . " 
Imagine you can do that . 
Having this habit , this mental habit , changes everything at work . 
Because this good will is unconsciously picked up by other people , and it creates trust , and trust creates a lot of good working relationships . 
And this also creates the conditions for compassion in the workplace . 
Someday , we hope to open - source " Search Inside Yourself " so that everybody in the corporate world will at least be able to use it as a reference . 
And in closing , I want to end the same place I started , with happiness . 
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes , not the other guy -- the Dalai Lama , who said , " If you want others to be happy , practice compassion . 
If you want to be happy , practice compassion . " 
I found this to be true , both on the individual level and at a corporate level . 
And I hope that compassion will be both fun and profitable for you too . 
Thank you .

Political prisoners are n't the only ones being tortured -- the vast majority of judicial torture happens in ordinary cases , even in ' functioning ' legal systems . Social activist Karen Tse shows how we can , and should , stand up and end the use of routine torture .

Karen Tse : How to stop torture 
In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year - old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel . 
And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year - old boy who had done something important for anybody . 
He was not a political prisoner . 
He was a 12-year - old boy who had stolen a bicycle . 
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but of the 113 developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured . 
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool . 
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners . 
It is for people who are in broken - down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it 's cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time . 
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things . 
First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide . 
The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel . 
And the third is commitment . 
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ? 
Could we do something for these 93 countries ? 
And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms . 
My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all . 
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you 'd walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year - old boys , you 'd meet women and you 'd say , " Why are you here ? " Women would say , " Well I 've been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they ca n't find him . " 
So it 's just a place where there was no rule of law . 
The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , " Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? " 
And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , [ inaudible name ] , and she said " Khrew , " which means " teacher . " 
She said , " I have defended more than a hundred people , and I 've never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions . " 
And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law . 
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws . 
And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , " No , no , no , no , we 're going to do things the exact same way we 've been doing them . " 
But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house . 
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her . 
She was pregnant at the time . She had cigarette burns on her . She 'd miscarried . 
And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , " Yes , there 's no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . " 
And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia . 
But Cambodia is not alone . 
I used to think , well is it Cambodia ? 
Or is it other countries ? 
But it is in so many countries . 
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it was n't a 12-year - old boy , it was an 8-year - old boy for stealing a mobile phone . 
Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said " Your baby is so cute . " 
It was n't a baby , she was three . 
And she said " Yeah , but she 's why I 'm here , " because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison . 
And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , " You 've got to let her out . 
A judge would let her out . " 
And he said , " Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? " 
So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases . 
But we realized that it 's not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference . 
For example , in Cambodia , it was that [ inaudible name ] did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , " It 's like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . " 
Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , " I 've been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , " he came and we had a training together and he said , " I have heard it said " -- because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling -- " I have heard it said that we can not help to create justice because we do not have the resources . " 
And then he said , " But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . " 
And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases . 
The key that we see , though , is training and then early access . 
I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , " Hey , look , we do n't have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were torturing everybody all the time . " 
And I said , " But there 's been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here . 
What 's going on ? " 
I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders . 
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual . 
I said , " I 'm gon na copy this . " 
It had everything in it . Lawyers can come at the police station . It was perfect . 
Prosecutors were perfectly trained . 
But I said to them , " I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor 's office , what had happened to them ? " 
And after a pause , they said , " They had been tortured . " 
So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured . 
And as I tell you this , I 'm also aware of the fact that it sounds like , " Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? " 
Because it sounds big . 
And there are many reasons why I believe it 's possible . 
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment . 
It 's not only Innocent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces . 
We have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ? 
So it 's an online contest where it 's only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice . 
And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do . 
And it 's not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward . 
So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police can not torture people or they will be punished . 
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , " How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ? 
This is fantastic . " And he said to me , " Well , do you have money ? " And I said , " No . " And he said , " That 's okay , we can still figure it out . " 
And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non - violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights . 
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders . 
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel . 
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this . 
And people often say to me , " You know , this is great , but it 's wildly idealistic . 
Never going to happen . " 
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid . 
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit . 
Now , there 's one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : " Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . " 
And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool . 
I end always , because I 'm sure the questions are -- and I 'd be happy to talk to you at any point -- " But what can I really do ? " 
Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vishna , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice . 
Vishna was a 4-year - old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars . 
So , you know , there 's bars . And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger . 
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit . 
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through . 
Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through . 
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here 's Vishna . He 's a 4-year - old boy . 
He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , " Probably I ca n't do everything . 
But I 'm one . I can do something . 
And I will do the one thing that I can do . " 
So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . 
Thank you .

Paola Antonelli , design curator at New York ’s Museum of Modern Art , wants to spread her appreciation of design -- in all shapes and forms -- around the world . 
art , arts , culture , design , museums

Paola Antonelli treats design as art 
Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be . 
And in my idea , heaven is satisfied curiosity . 
I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud where I can just lie down with my belly down , like I was watching TV when I was a child , and my elbows up . 
And I can basically look everywhere I want , see every movie I 've always wanted to see . 
And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes in the subway in New York when you 're reading , there 's something really soothing and easy . 
Well , the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life , in a way , because I discovered ... 
it took me a while to understand it , but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable with objects than with people , I finally decided to really embrace this passion . 
And I basically live my life in sort of a trance , and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story . 
Just to give you an example : this is the exhibition , Humble Masterpieces , as it was at MoMA in 2004 . 
We were in Queens , we were building the big , big , big , big building in Midtown , so we were in the small , small , small boondocks . 
That was one of the funnest moments of my career . 
But it 's not only that . 
The typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica ; it 's its 50th anniversary this year . 
And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together , trying to outdo Akzidenz - Grotesk , and come up with a new sans - serif typeface -- and the movie starts playing in my head already . 
And of course , you can imagine , with Humble Masterpieces it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred . 
And I do hope , by the way , that the real goal of the exhibition is going to have the same effect on you . 
The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ... 
you know when they do homeworks at home ? 
Instead of having a tray with two peas , I was hoping that they would go into the kitchen cabinet or the mother 's handbag and do their museum - quality design collection on a tray . 
So , everybody 's always suggesting new humble masterpieces , and at MoMA we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces . 
And when you do that , usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions , and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions . 
And a lot of nationalism came in . 
For instance , I did n't know that the Spaniards invented the mop , but they were very proud so every Spaniard said " la frego . " And Italians did the pizza . 
And I wanted to show you , also , the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good -- they had moonshine , laundry detergents and liquid nails . 
And I keep it going , and I just got , also , this suggestion from Milan : it 's our traffic divider , which we call " panettone , " and it 's painted ; it 's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan to define all the lanes of traffic . 
So , think of your own , send them on if you want to -- they 're always welcome . 
But an exhibition like that made me understand even more what I 've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA . 
I 'm Italian . In Italy , design is normal . 
Different parts of the world have a knack for different things . 
I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay , and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism that you do n't see elsewhere , but the contemporary art was terrible . 
In Italy , in Milan especially , contemporary art really does n't have that much of a place . 
But design -- oh , my God . 
What you find at the store at the corner , without going to any kind of fancy store , is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that we are all so sophisticated . 
It 's just what you find at the store . 
And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art . 
I 'm always amazed -- three - year - olds know who Richard Serra is and take you to the galleries . 
But design , for some reason , is still misunderstood for decoration . 
It 's really interesting : what many people think when I say the word " design " is they think of this kind of overdesigned -- in this case , it 's overdesigned on purpose , but -- decoration , interior decoration . 
They think of somebody choosing fabrics . 
Design can be that , of course , but it can also be this . 
It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people , because , as you know , Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies . 
So , what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline , so that instead of being completely strangled , a teenager can also sip a Coke . 
They tried to make a toddler 's gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important . 
And then they make a little tent for the baby . 
However cruel , however ruthless you can think this is it 's a great design , and it is miles away from the fancy furniture , but still , it 's part of my same field of passion . 
What I 've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to harness the power of MoMA because it 's great to work there . You really have power in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions , and that is power because in a design museum I would n't have as many visitors . 
I 'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse , and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there . 
But what I 've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929 , which is to try and see what 's going on in the world and try to use that authority in order to make things better . 
There have been many episodes , and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience , but in two instances , his great - grandfather , grandfather -- I 'm always a little perplexed about the relation , exactly -- Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions : one in 1940 , it was about organic furniture , and the second one in 1948 was low - cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture . 
And then there was good design for very low price . 
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life . 
So , I started out in ' 95 with this exhibition that was called Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design . 
It was about a new phase , in my opinion , in the world of design in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves . 
And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California ; at that time , they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market . 
And at the same time , the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro , who did these beautiful salt - and - pepper containers that are made of rice dough . 
So you see , the range is really quite diverse . 
And then , for instance , this other exhibition that was entitled Workspheres in 2001 , where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time . 
And you see IDEO there . 
It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies . 
The idea was that if you had a cubicle , you could project a sky on top of your head and have your own " Cielo in Una Stanza " -- a sky in a room -- it 's a very famous Italian song . 
And other examples : this was Marti Guixe about working on the go , and Hella Jongerius , my favorite , about how to work at home . 
And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design : designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world . 
What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs , current conditions in economy , in materials , in sustainability issues , and then what they do at the end -- if they are good -- is much more than the sum of its parts . 
Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious . 
The idea behind her work was that at that time , everybody was saying you have to really divide your life . 
Instead , she said , " No , no . Work and leisure can be together . " 
Yeah , that 's particularly gorgeous -- it 's the TV dinner of 2001 . 
There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime , but I do n't want to focus on my shows . 
I would like , instead , to talk about how great some designers are . 
I 've always had a hard time with the word " maverick . " 
I came to the United States 13 years ago , and to this day I have to ask , " What does that mean ? " 
So , this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle . 
Therefore , he was not following everybody 's lead , and therefore , he was a maverick . 
So , designers do need to be mavericks , because the best way to design a successful object -- and also an object that we were missing before -- is to pretend that either it never existed or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it . 
So , Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA and it ended at the beginning of last year . 
It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection . 
It 's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency . 
And then when 9/11 happened , I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition until , slowly but surely , it came back -- as a half - full glass instead of half - empty -- and it was about protection and safety . 
But it ranged from such items as a complete de - mining equipment to these kind of water - sterilizing straws , so it was really wide - ranging . 
It also had ... you know , Cameron and I worked a little bit together , and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition . 
But what is interesting is that we do n't need to talk about design and art anymore ; design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point . 
It 's a sense of economy and a sense , also , of humor . 
This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland , who 's South African . 
It 's a suit for civil disobedience . 
The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest and the police comes towards you , you 're wearing this thing -- it 's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart so your heartbeat is amplified -- and the police is reminded ; it 's like having a flower in front of the rifle . 
And also , you can imagine , a whole group of people with the same suit will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police . 
So , designers sometimes do n't do things that are immediately functional , but they 're functional to our understanding of issues . 
Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia , like this hideaway furniture that 's made in the same wood as your floor so it disappears completely and you can hide away ; or even better , the huggable atomic mushroom , which got me an article on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States -- I do n't think it ever happened before at MoMA ; or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations . 
But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self , and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic . 
This is Cindy van den Bremen , who is a Dutch designer that 's done this series of Capsters . 
They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski , play tennis , do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves . 
And sometimes by doing this kind of research , you encounter such beautiful ideas of design . 
Twan Verdonck is really young , I think he 's 27 , and working together with some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial stimulation for children that have psychological impairments . 
They 're quite beautiful . 
They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you -- because autistic children like to be hugged tight , so it has a spring inside -- all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself in the mirror and regain a sense of self . 
Design really looks upon the whole world and it considers the world in all of its different ranges . 
I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul . 
And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury , and I did n't want to be a party pooper but at the same time I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality . 
And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury , and there 's luxury that is relative for people that do n't have that much . 
I want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very , very clear limits . 
This is Cuba , and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell , and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks . 
So they 're quite beautiful , but they 're beautiful because they 're so smart and economical . 
And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo , Fernando and Humberto Campana , who got inspired by the poverty and smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are selling for an enormous amount of money . 
But that 's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself . 
So really , design takes everything into account , and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances , as we become more and more wireless and impalpable , designers , instead , want us to be hands - on . 
Sometimes hammer - on . 
This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically . 
Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes your imprint , all the way to this beautiful series of objects that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona . 
From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples to these intra - toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes . 
It 's quite beautiful because somehow , this is a gorgeous moment for design . 
Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna , whose name was Marchetti , explain how the innovation in the military industry -- therefore , secret innovation -- and the innovation in the civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed . 
And that makes sense . 
In moments of war there 's great technological innovation , and in the world you have to do without -- well , during the Second World War , you had to do without steel , you had to do without aluminum . 
And then as peace comes , all of these technologies get all of a sudden available for the civilian market . 
Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance : fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden . 
I think that this is a strange moment . 
The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously , just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years , so I 'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is . 
But it surely is a very important moment for design , because not only is the technology proceeding , not only is computing technology making open - source possible also in the world of design , but also the idea of sustainability -- which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint , but also sustainability of human interrelationships -- is very much part of the work of so many designers . 
And that 's why designers , more and more , are working on behaviors rather than on objects . 
Especially the good ones , not all of them . 
I wanted to show you , for instance , the work of Mathieu Lehanneur , which is quite fantastic . 
He 's another young designer from France who 's working -- and at this point he 's working , also , with pharmaceutical companies -- on new ways to engage patients , especially children , in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty . 
For instance , this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine that kind of inflates itself when it 's time for you to take the medicine , so the child has to go -- pffff ! -- to release and relieve the container itself . 
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin , so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved in this particular kind of delivery . 
Similarly , there 's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste , orally . 
The next show that I 'm going to work on -- and I 've been bugging a lot of you about this here -- is about the relationship between design and science . 
I 'm trying to find not the metaphors , but , rather , the points in common -- the common gripes , the common issues , the common preoccupations -- and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design as an instruction , as a direction rather than a prescription of form . 
And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this . 
I 've sent an email already to quite a few of you . 
But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales , and therefore , really work at the scale of the very small to make it very big and very meaningful . 
Thank you .

Ory Okolloh on becoming an activist 
So what 's image got do with it ? 
And I must say , I think Emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages , because I 'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up . 
But I 'm going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we 've been talking about . 
So , Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions , as you can see . 
We 're not the only ones . 
And you know , it 's amazing . 
I mean , we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent . 
Just think about that , you know ? 
And this is typically what we 've been talking about , the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff . 
Now , why is that a problem ? 
A typical disaster story : disease , corruption , poverty . 
And some of you might be standing here thinking , saying , " OK , you know , Ory , you 're Harvard - educated , and all you privileged people come here , saying , ' Forget the poor people . 
Let 's focus on business and the markets , and whatever . ' " And they 're all , " There 's the 80 percent of Africans who really need help . " 
And I want to tell you that this is my story , OK ? 
And it 's the story of many of the Africans who are here . 
We start with poverty . 
I did n't grow up in the slums or anything that dire , but I know what it is to grow up without having money , or being able to support family . 
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs . 
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast . 
You know , when things were good , we had eggs and sausages . 
When things were bad , we had porridge . 
And like many African families , my parents could never save because they supported siblings , cousins , you know , their parents , and things were always dicey . 
Now , when I was born , they realized they had a pretty smart kid , and they did n't want me to go to the neighborhood school , which was free . 
And they adopted a very interesting approach to education , which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford . 
So they took me to a private , Catholic , elementary school , which set the foundation for what ended up being my career . 
And what happened was , because they could afford it sometimes , sometimes not , I got kicked out pretty much every term . 
You know , someone would come in with a list of the people who have n't paid school fees , and when they started getting pretty strict , you had to leave , until your school fees could be paid . 
And I remember thinking , I mean , why do n't these guys just take me to a cheap school ? 
Because you know , as a kid you 're embarrassed and you 're sensitive , and everyone knows you guys do n't have money . 
But they kept at it , and I now understand why they did what they did . 
They talk about corruption . 
In Kenya , we have an entrance exam to go into high school . 
And there 's national schools , which are like the best schools , and provincial schools . 
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School , a national school . 
I missed the cutoff by one point . 
And I was so disappointed , and I was like , " Oh my God , you know , what am I going to do ? " 
And my father said , " OK , listen . 
Let 's go and try and talk to the headmistress . 
You know , it 's just one point . I mean , maybe she 'll let you in if that slot 's still there . " 
So we went to the school , and because we were nobodies , and because we did n't have privilege , and because my father did n't have the right last name , he was treated like dirt . 
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him , saying , you know , who do you think you are ? 
And , you know , you must be joking if you think you can get a slot . 
And I had gone to school with other girls , who were kids of politicians , and who had done much , much worse than I did , and they had slots there . 
And there 's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you , you know ? 
And we left , and I swore to myself , and I was like , " I 'm never , ever going to have to beg for anything in my life . " 
They called me two weeks later , they 're like , oh , yeah , you can come now . And I told them to stuff it . 
Final story , and I sort of have to speak quickly . 
Disease . 
My father , who I 've been talking about , died of AIDS in 1999 . 
He never told anyone that he had AIDS , his fear of the stigma was so strong . 
And I 'm pretty much the one who figured it out , because I was a nerd . 
And I was in the States at the time , and they called me . He was very sick , the first time he got sick . 
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis . 
And so I went on to Google , Cryptococcal meningitis , you know . 
Because of doctor - patient privilege , they could n't really tell us what was going on . 
But they were like , you know , this is a long - term thing . 
And when I went online and looked at the infectious -- read about the disease , I pretty much realized what was going on . 
The first time he got sick , he recovered . 
But what happened was that he had to be on medication that , at that time -- Diflucan , which in the States is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill . 
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life . 
You know , so money ran out . 
He got sick again . 
And up until that time , he had a friend who used to travel to India , and he used to import , bring him , could get him a generic version of it . 
And that kept him going . 
But the money ran out . 
He got sick again . He got sick on a Friday . 
At that time , there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya , and we could not get cash . The family could n't get cash for him to start the treatment until Monday . 
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days . 
And finally , we figured , well , OK , we 'd better just try and take him to a public hospital . 
At least he 'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation . 
And he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him . 
And , you know , now , imagine if -- and I could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me . 
How would you look at me ? 
With pity , you know . Sadness . 
And this is how you look at Africa . 
This is the damage it causes . 
You do n't see the other side of me . 
You do n't see the blogger , you do n't see the Harvard - educated lawyer , the vibrant person , you know ? 
And I just wanted to personalize that . 
Because we talk about it in big terms , and you wonder , you know , so what ? 
But it 's damaging . 
And I 'm not unique , right ? 
Imagine if all you knew about William was the fact that he grew up in a poor village . 
And you did n't know about the windmill , you know ? 
And I was just moved . 
I was actually crying during his presentation . 
He was like , I try and I make . 
I was like Nike should hire him , you know , " Just do it ! " 
And this is , again , the point I 'm trying to make . 
When you focus just on the disasters -- -- we 're ignoring the potential . 
So , what is to be done ? 
First of all , Africans , we need to get better at telling our stories . 
We heard about that yesterday . 
We had some of them this morning . 
And this is an example , you know , blogging is one way of doing that . 
Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs that was developed in South Africa . 
So we need to start getting better . 
If no one else will tell our stories , let 's do it . 
And going back to the point I was trying to make , this is the Swahili Wikipedia . 
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa . 
It only has five contributors . 
Four of them are white males -- non - native speakers . 
The other person is -- Ndesanjo , if you 're here , stand up -- is a Tanzanian , [ the ] first Swahili blogger . 
He 's the only African who 's contributing to this . 
People , please . We ca n't whine and complain the West is doing this . 
What are we doing ? 
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers ? 
Why are we not generating our own content ? 
You know , it 's not enough to complain . We need to act . 
Reuters now integrates African blogs into their coverage of Africa . 
So , that 's a start , and we 've heard of all their other initiatives . 
The cheetah generation . 
The aid approach , you know , is flawed . 
And after all the hoopla of Live 8 , we 're still not anywhere in the picture . 
No , you 're not . 
But the point I 'm trying to make , though , is that it 's not enough for us to criticize . 
And for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should I be , should I move back , should I stay ? 
You know , just jump . 
The continent needs you . 
And I ca n't emphasize that enough , you know . 
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C. , Covington and Burling , six figures . 
With two paychecks , or three paychecks , I could solve a lot of my family 's problems . 
But I walked away from that , because my passion was here , and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling . 
And because I 'm needed here , you know ? 
I probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a Harvard Law School degree because of all the things I 'm doing . 
One is because I 'm pretty aggressive , and I try and find , you know , opportunities . 
But there is such a need , you know ? 
I 'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called Enablis that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa . 
We 're now moving into East Africa . 
And we give them business development services , as well as financing loan and equity . 
I 've also set up a project in Kenya , and what we do is we track the performance of Kenyan MPs . 
My partner , M , who 's a tech guru , hacked WordPress . 
It costs us , like , 20 dollars a month just for hosting . 
Everything else on there is a labor of love . 
We 've manually entered all the data there . 
And you can get profiles of each MP , questions they 've asked in parliament . 
We have a comment function , where people can ask their MPs questions . 
There are some MPs who participate , and come back and ask . 
And basically , we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians . 
You know , I believe that accountability stems from demand . 
You 're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart . 
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders . 
What are they doing ? 
You know , they 're not going to change just out of nowhere . 
So we need new policies , we need -- where 's that coming from , you know ? 
Another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society . 
We talk about African governments like they 've been dropped from Mars , you know ? 
They come from us . 
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we do n't like ? 
And how can we change that ? 
So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable . 
Where do we go from here ? 
I believe in the power of ideas . 
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge . 
And I 'd ask all of you , when you leave here , please just share , and keep the ideas that you 've gotten out of here going , because it can make a difference . 
The other thing I want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual . 
I 've had lots of conversations about things I think need to be happening in Africa . 
People are like , " OK , if you do n't do aid , I 'm a bleeding heart liberal , what can I do ? " 
And when I talk about my ideas , they 're like , " BBut it 's not scalable , you know . 
Give me something I can do with Paypal . " 
It 's not that easy , you know ? 
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual , in the fellows you 've met , and the businesspeople you 've met , it can make a huge difference , especially in Africa , because usually the individual in Africa carries a lot of people behind them . 
Practically . I mean , when I was a first - year student in law school , my mom 's business had collapsed , so I was supporting her . 
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad . 
I was helping her pay her tuition . 
My cousin ran out of school fees , and she 's really smart . 
I was paying her school fees . 
A cousin of mine died of AIDS , left an orphan , so we said , well , what are we going to do with her ? 
You know , she 's now my baby sister . 
And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me , I am able to lift all those people . 
So , do n't underestimate that . 
An example . This man changed my life . 
He 's a professor . He 's now at Vanderbilt . 
He 's an undergrad professor , Mitchell Seligson . 
And because of him , I got into Harvard Law School , because he took an interest . 
I was taking a class of his , and he was just like , this is an overeager student , which we do n't normally get in the United States , because everyone else is cynical and jaded . 
He called me to his office and said , " What do you want to do when you grow up ? " 
I said , " I want to be a lawyer . " 
And he was like , " Why ? You know , we do n't need another lawyer in the United States . " 
And he tried to talk me out of it , but it was like , " OK , I know nothing about applying to law school , I 'm poli - sci Ph.D. 
But , you know , let 's figure out what I need you to do , what I need to do to help you out . " 
It was like , " Where do you want to go ? " 
And to me at that time university -- I was at University of Pitts for undergrad , and that was like heaven , OK , because compared to what could have been in Kenya . 
So I 'm like , " Yeah , I 'm just applying to Pitt for law school . " 
He was like , " Why ? You know , you 're smart , you have all these things going for you . " 
And I 'm like , " Because I 'm here and it 's cheap , and you know , I kind of like Pittsburgh . " 
Like , that 's the dumbest reason I 've ever heard for applying to law school . 
And , you know , so he took me under his wing , and he encouraged me . 
And he said , " Look , you can get into Harvard , you 're that good , OK ? 
And if they do n't admit you , they 're the ones who are messed up . " 
And he built me up , you know ? 
And this is just an illustration . 
You can meet other individuals here . 
We just need a push . 
That 's all I needed was a push to go to the next level . 
Basically , I want to end with my vision for Africa , you know ? 
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential . 
You know , my vision is that my daughter , and any other African child being born today , can be whoever they want to be here , without having to leave . 
And they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born . 
That 's one thing you Americans take for granted , you know ? 
That you can grow up , you know , not so good circumstances , and you can move . 
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas , whatever , that does n't define who you are . 
For most Africans today , where you live , or where you were born , and the circumstances under which you were born , determine the rest of your life . 
I would like to see that change , and the change starts with us . 
And as Africans , we need to take responsibility for our continent . 
Thank you .

Anemia is a major -- and completely preventable -- cause of deaths in childbirth in many places around the world , but the standard test is invasive and slow . In this witty and inspiring talk , TED Fellow Myshkin Ingawale describes how he and his team created a simple , portable , low - cost device that can test for anemia without breaking the skin .

Myshkin Ingawale : A blood test without bleeding 
I like to build stuff . 
I 've always liked to build stuff . 
My team at Biosense , a startup I co - founded with my doctor and engineer friends , has built a technology called ToucHB , which can do blood testing of hemoglobin without pricks , without needles . 
I believe this is going to democratize health care . 
They 're two big words , I do n't know what they mean . 
In fact , in 2009 , I was even more clueless . 
I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen next . 
I was , in fact , busy trying to finish off my Ph.D. , which was in a completely unrelated area of how people interact , contributors interact , how articles are formed in Wikipedia -- trying to figure out how quality emerges from the system . 
I was also building something called the Copenhagen Wheel , which is just a really beautiful , beautiful electric bike at a lab at MIT called SENSEable City Lab . 
I was lucky enough that I visited Mumbai , my house , back for a vacation . 
So at that time I was planning a road trip . 
I visited a place called Parol about two hours north of Mumbai . 
This is a place where my friend , Abhishek Sen was interning . 
He 's a doctor there . 
And that 's his actual photograph . 
So Abhishek actually made me wait . 
He was out there in Parol delivering a baby . 
I was waiting , and when he did emerge , he was ashen - faced . 
He told me that there had been two deaths ; the mother and child both had died . 
The reason , he told me , was something called post partum hemorrhage . 
He explained this meant severe internal bleeding . 
What was really shocking for me was that he said that this is entirely due to undiagnosed anemia . 
Now anemia -- I 'm an engineer , but even I knew -- that anemia is something which is not supposed to be fatal . 
It is something which probably the cure is known . 
I mean , folic acid , iron tablets -- very cheap , affordable cures exist to control anemia . 
So why was this woman dying ? 
It was completely preventable . 
Five minutes away from there , I had the center , the medical center , which was distributing subsidized iron tablets . 
So the whole nature of this thing completely shocked me . 
And I knew that there had to be a way to prevent this . 
My mom is a pediatrician , and I asked her . 
She told me that this is how you would typically test for anemia . 
Take a blood sample and run it through a machine called a Coulter counter . 
This is a $ 10,000 machine which was available in Mumbai . 
It 's also available here or in any part , I guess , in Europe and most cities in the world . 
But this is not available in Parol . 
Also , that woman who was operating the machine , the technician , is not available in Parol . 
Now this struck me as -- I love to fix things . I wanted to fix this . 
I got a friend of mine , an engineer , and three other doctors -- Abhishek joined the team -- and we wanted to solve this problem . 
By the time I step down from here there will be 10 people who have lost their lives through a completely , completely preventable problem . 
Now let me take you back to Parol . 
You saw the woman there , the nurse . 
In India this is called an ASHA worker . 
It 's essentially a village health worker , a matron . 
She is really the center of the health care system . 
Public health care runs on the ASHA worker , not the doctor . 
Now we knew we had to design something which she could use . 
We knew it had to be these three things that the machine had to have . 
We knew it had to be something which had no needles , no pricking , so it would have adoption , it would not have medical waste , all those problems . 
It had to be simple enough for that woman ASHA worker to use . 
And thirdly , it had to be something which she could carry in her kit . 
She goes village to village doing screenings . 
We thought we could build it , so we built it . 
But , but it did n't work . 
So we built it again . 
And we did this 32 times . 
But I 'm very excited to tell you that last year we did build it -- it works . 
And I have it here in my purse . 
So this is a machine called the ToucHB Quik . 
What it does is it measures my hemoglobin , oxygen and pulse rate . 
I put it on my finger , switch it on , and in about 20 seconds it 'll give me , on the little screen here , a value of hemoglobin , oxygen saturation and heart rate . 
This will help ASHA workers diagnose anemia at the point of care . 
I 'll explain a little bit about how it works . 
You might have seen a little light inside of it . 
In fact , there are three lights in there , three wavelengths of light . 
And we essentially pass light right through the tissue , and from understanding how much of it is transmitted , how much of it is scattered and how much of it is absorbed , we can figure out how much hemoglobin is there in the blood . 
And this is something which is based on a principle called photoplethysmography . 
We are actually really very excited about what else non - invasive techniques like this will be able to crack in the future . 
One of the things which my intern here , Pratesh , built is a mobile application , which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go . 
There 's a bunch of very exciting stuff which we are doing . 
I would love to tell you a little bit more about it . 
But fundamentally , what I believe is that the map behind of me is called basically the map of anemia . 
It 's the death rates caused by anemia globally . 
You 'll notice , of course , that there are hot spots -- South Asia , Africa . 
My business plan is very simple . 
I 'm just going to sell these to every clinic in the world . 
That 's a simple bottom - line business plan . 
And by the time I 'm done , in 2020 , when the WHO publishes the data again , this is going to be the map of anemia . 
Thank you .

Shame is an unspoken epidemic , the secret behind many forms of broken behavior . Brené Brown , whose earlier talk on vulnerability became a viral hit , explores what can happen when people confront their shame head - on . Her own humor , humanity and vulnerability shine through every word .

Brené Brown : Listening to shame 
I 'm going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk . 
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life . 
And I actually did n't leave my house for about three days . 
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch . 
And when I walked in , she was already at the table . 
And I sat down , and she said , " God , you look like hell . " 
I said , " Thanks . I feel really -- I 'm not functioning . " 
And she said , " What 's going on ? " 
And I said , " I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability . 
And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data , as absolutely essential to whole - hearted living , I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown . 
I had a slide that said Breakdown . 
At what point did I think that was a good idea ? " 
And she said , " I saw your Talk live - streamed . 
It was not really you . 
It was a little different than what you usually do . 
But it was great . " 
And I said , " This ca n't happen . 
YouTube , they 're putting this thing on YouTube . 
And we 're going to be talking about 600 , 700 people . " 
And she said , " Well , I think it 's too late . " 
And I said , " Let me ask you something . " 
And she said , " Yeah . " 
And I said , " Do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb ? " 
And she said , " Yeah . " 
And I said , " Remember when we 'd leave a really bad message on our ex - boyfriend 's answering machine ? 
Then we 'd have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape ? " 
And she goes , " Uh ... no . " 
So of course , the only thing I could think of to say at that point was , " Yeah , me neither . 
That ... me neither . " 
And I 'm thinking to myself , " Brene , what are you doing ? What are you doing ? 
Why did you bring this up ? Have you lost your mind ? 
Your sisters would be perfect for this . " 
So I looked back up and she said , " Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube ? " 
And I said , " I 'm just thinking about it a little bit . " 
She said , " You 're like the worst vulnerability role model ever . " 
And then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic , but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic . 
I said , " If 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000 , my life is over . " 
I had no contingency plan for four million . 
And my life did end when that happened . 
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as I would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small , staying right under the radar . 
But I want to talk about what I 've learned . 
There 's two things that I 've learned in the last year . 
The first is vulnerability is not weakness . 
And that myth is profoundly dangerous . 
Let me ask you honestly -- and I 'll give you this warning , I 'm trained as a therapist , so I can out - wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly , when you 're thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable , think , " God , vulnerability 's weakness . This is weakness ? " 
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously ? 
The majority of people . 
Now let me ask you this question : This past week at TED , how many of you , when you saw vulnerability up here , thought it was pure courage ? 
Vulnerability is not weakness . 
I define vulnerability as emotional risk , exposure , uncertainty . 
It fuels our daily lives . 
And I 've come to the belief -- this is my 12th year doing this research -- that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage -- to be vulnerable , to let ourselves be seen , to be honest . 
One of the weird things that 's happened is , after the TED explosion , I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies . 
And so many of the calls went like this , " Hey , Dr. Brown . We loved your TEDTalk . 
We 'd like you to come in and speak . 
We 'd appreciate it if you would n't mention vulnerability or shame . " 
What would you like for me to talk about ? 
There 's three big answers . 
This is mostly , to be honest with you , from the business sector : innovation , creativity and change . 
So let me go on the record and say , vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation , creativity and change . 
To create is to make something that has never existed before . 
There 's nothing more vulnerable than that . 
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability . 
The second thing , in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage , the second thing I learned is this : We have to talk about shame . 
And I 'm going to be really honest with you . 
When I became a " vulnerability researcher " and that became the focus because of the TEDTalk -- and I 'm not kidding . 
I 'll give you an example . 
About three months ago , I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store . 
About from a hundred feet away , this is what I hear : " Vulnerability TED ! Vulnerability TED ! " 
I 'm a fifth generation Texan . 
Our family motto is " Lock and load . " 
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher . 
So I 'm like , just keep walking , she 's on my six . 
And then I hear , " Vulnerability TED ! " 
I turn around , I go , " Hi . " 
She 's right here and she said , " You 're the shame researcher who had the breakdown . " 
At this point parents are , like , pulling their children close . 
" Look away . " 
And I 'm so worn out at this point in my life , I look at her and I actually say , " It was a frickin ' spiritual awakening . " 
And she looks back and does this , " I know . " 
And she said , " We watched your TEDTalk in my book club . 
Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves ' The Breakdown Babes . ' " And she said , " Our tagline is : ' We 're falling apart and it feels fantastic . ' " You can only imagine what it 's like for me in a faculty meeting . 
So when I became Vulnerability TED , like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie , but I 'm Vulnerability TED -- I thought , I 'm going to leave that shame stuff behind , because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability . 
And I thought , thank God , because shame is this horrible topic , no one wants to talk about it . 
It 's the best way to shut people down on an airplane . 
" What do you do ? " " I study shame . " " Oh . " 
And I see you . 
But in surviving this last year , I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule , but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you 've got to dance with the one who brung ya . 
And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability . 
I learned about these things from studying shame . 
And so I want to walk you in to shame . 
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul . 
And we 're going to walk in . 
And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there . 
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around . 
Here 's why . 
We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country , and I think globally , around race , right ? 
Yes ? We heard that . 
Yes ? 
Can not have that conversation without shame , because you can not talk about race without talking about privilege . 
And when people start talking about privilege , they get paralyzed by shame . 
We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery , which is have a checklist . 
You ca n't fix that problem without addressing shame , because when they teach those folks how to suture , they also teach them how to stitch their self - worth to being all - powerful . 
And all - powerful folks do n't need checklists . 
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I did n't mess it up here . 
Myshkin Ingawale , I hope I did right by you . 
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here . 
And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily . 
And he said , " I saw this need . 
So you know what I did ? I made it . " 
And everybody just burst into applause , and they were like " Yes ! " 
And he said , " And it did n't work . 
And then I made it 32 more times , and then it worked . " 
You know what the big secret about TED is ? 
I ca n't wait to tell people this . 
I guess I 'm doing it right now . 
This is like the failure conference . 
No , it is . 
You know why this place is amazing ? 
Because very few people here are afraid to fail . 
And no one who gets on the stage , so far that I 've seen , has not failed . 
I 've failed miserably , many times . 
I do n't think the world understands that because of shame . 
There 's a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt . 
A lot of people refer to it as the " Man in the Arena " quote . 
And it goes like this : " It is not the critic who counts . 
It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles . 
The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat . 
But when he 's in the arena , at best he wins , and at worst he loses , but when he fails , when he loses , he does so daring greatly . " 
And that 's what this conference , to me , is about . 
That 's what life is about , about daring greatly , about being in the arena . 
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door , and you think , " I 'm going in and I 'm going to try this , " shame is the gremlin who says , " Uh , uh . 
You 're not good enough . 
You never finished that MBA . Your wife left you . 
I know your dad really was n't in Luxembourg , he was in Sing Sing . 
I know those things that happened to you growing up . 
I know you do n't think that you 're pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough . 
I know your dad never paid attention , even when you made CFO . " 
Shame is that thing . 
And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say , " I 'm going to do this , " we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing , 99 percent of the time is who ? 
Us . 
Shame drives two big tapes -- " never good enough " and , if you can talk it out of that one , " who do you think you are ? " 
The thing to understand about shame is it 's not guilt . 
Shame is a focus on self , guilt is a focus on behavior . 
Shame is " I am bad . " 
Guilt is " I did something bad . " 
How many of you , if you did something that was hurtful to me , would be willing to say , " I 'm sorry . I made a mistake ? " 
How many of you would be willing to say that ? 
Guilt : I 'm sorry . I made a mistake . 
Shame : I 'm sorry . I am a mistake . 
There 's a huge difference between shame and guilt . 
And here 's what you need to know . 
Shame is highly , highly correlated with addiction , depression , violence , aggression , bullying , suicide , eating disorders . 
And here 's what you even need to know more . 
Guilt , inversely correlated with those things . 
The ability to hold something we 've done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive . 
It 's uncomfortable , but it 's adaptive . 
The other thing you need to know about shame is it 's absolutely organized by gender . 
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris , it 's going to feel the same . 
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame . 
We 're pretty sure that the only people who do n't experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy . 
Which means , yes , I have a little shame ; no , I 'm a sociopath . 
So I would opt for , yes , you have a little shame . 
Shame feels the same for men and women , but it 's organized by gender . 
For women , the best example I can give you is Enjoli the commercial : " I can put the wash on the line , pack the lunches , hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine . 
I can bring home the bacon , fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you 're a man . " 
For women , shame is do it all , do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat . 
I do n't know how much perfume that commercial sold , but I guarantee you , it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti - anxiety meds . 
Shame , for women , is this web of unobtainable , conflicting , competing expectations about who we 're supposed to be . 
And it 's a straight - jacket . 
For men , shame is not a bunch of competing , conflicting expectations . 
Shame is one , do not be perceived as what ? 
Weak . 
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study . 
And it was n't until a man looked at me one day after a book signing , said , " I love what you have to say about shame , I 'm curious why you did n't mention men . " 
And I said , " I do n't study men . " 
And he said , " That 's convenient . " 
And I said , " Why ? " 
And he said , " Because you say to reach out , tell our story , be vulnerable . 
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters ? " 
I said , " Yeah . " 
" They 'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down . 
When we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us . 
And do n't tell me it 's from the guys and the coaches and the dads , because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else . " 
So I started interviewing men and asking questions . 
And what I learned is this : You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear , I 'll show you a woman who 's done incredible work . 
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who 's just had it , she ca n't do it all anymore , and his first response is not , " I unloaded the dishwasher , " but he really listens -- because that 's all we need -- I 'll show you a guy who 's done a lot of work . 
Shame is an epidemic in our culture . 
And to get out from underneath it , to find our way back to each other , we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we 're parenting , the way we 're working , the way we 're looking at each other . 
Very quickly , some research by Mahalik at Boston College . 
He asked , what do women need to do to conform to female norms ? 
The top answers in this country : nice , thin , modest and use all available resources for appearance . 
When he asked about men , what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms , the answers were : always show emotional control , work is first , pursue status and violence . 
If we 're going to find our way back to each other , we have to understand and know empathy , because empathy 's the antidote to shame . 
If you put shame in a Petri dish , it needs three things to grow exponentially : secrecy , silence and judgment . 
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy , it ca n't survive . 
The two most powerful words when we 're in struggle : me too . 
And so I 'll leave you with this thought . 
If we 're going to find our way back to each other , vulnerability is going to be that path . 
And I know it 's seductive to stand outside the arena , because I think I did it my whole life , and think to myself , I 'm going to go in there and kick some ass when I 'm bulletproof and when I 'm perfect . 
And that is seductive . 
But the truth is that never happens . 
And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there , that 's not what we want to see . 
We want you to go in . 
We want to be with you and across from you . 
And we just want , for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with , to dare greatly . 
So thank you all very much . I really appreciate it .

Plenty of robots can fly -- but none can fly like a real bird . That is , until Markus Fischer and his team at Festo built SmartBird , a large , lightweight robot , modeled on a seagull , that flies by flapping its wings . A soaring demo fresh from TEDGlobal 2011 .

A robot that flies like a bird 
It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird . 
Birds are very agile . 
They fly , not with rotating components , so they fly only by flapping their wings . 
So we looked at the birds , and we tried to make a model that is powerful , ultralight , and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings . 
So what would be better [ than ] to use the Herring Gull , in its freedom , circling and swooping over the sea , and [ to ] use this as a role model ? 
So we bring a team together . 
There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics in the field of building gliders . 
And the task was to build an ultralight indoor - flying model that is able to fly over your heads . 
So be careful later on . 
And this was one issue : to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down . 
So why do we do all this ? 
We are a company in the field of automation , and we 'd like to do very lightweight structures because that 's energy efficient , and we 'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena . 
So I now would like you to [ put ] your seat belts on and put your hats [ on ] . 
So maybe we 'll try it once -- to fly a SmartBird . 
Thank you . 
So we can now look at the SmartBird . 
So here is one without a skin . 
We have a wingspan of about two meters . 
The length is one meter and six , and the weight , it is only 450 grams . 
And it is all out of carbon fiber . 
In the middle we have a motor , and we also have a gear in it , and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor . 
So within the motor , we have three Hall sensors , so we know exactly where the wing is . 
And if we now beat up and down ... 
we have the possibility to fly like a bird . 
So if you go down , you have the large area of propulsion , and if you go up , the wings are not that large , and it is easier to get up . 
So , the next thing we did , or the challenges we did , was to coordinate this movement . 
We have to turn it , go up and go down . 
We have a split wing . 
With a split wing we get the lift at the upper wing , and we get the propulsion at the lower wing . 
Also , we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency . 
We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency . 
So therefore , it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion , from 30 percent up to 80 percent . 
Next thing we have to do , we have to control and regulate the whole structure . 
Only if you control and regulate it , you will get that aerodynamic efficiency . 
So the overall consumption of energy is about 25 watts at takeoff and 16 to 18 watts in flight . 
Thank you . 
Bruno Giussani : Markus , I think that we should fly it once more . 
Markus Fischer : Yeah , sure . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/thulasiraj_ravilla_how_low_cost_eye_care_can_be_world_class.html 
India 's revolutionary Aravind Eye Care System has given sight to millions . Thulasiraj Ravilla looks at the ingenious approach that drives its treatment costs down and quality up , and why its methods should trigger a re - think of all human services .

Thulasiraj Ravilla : How low - cost eye care can be world - class 
Good morning . 
I 've come here to share with you an experiment of how to get rid of one form of human suffering . 
It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy . 
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System . 
I think first it 's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind . 
Woman : Everywhere I went looking for work , they said no , what use do we have for a blind woman ? 
I could n't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair . 
If an ant fell into my rice , I could n't see that either . 
Thulasiraj Ravilla : Becoming blind is a big part of it , but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood , their dignity , their independence , and their status in the family . 
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind . 
And the irony is that they do n't need to be . 
A simple , well - proven surgery can restore sight to millions , and something even simpler , a pair of glasses , can make millions more see . 
If we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses , then almost one in five Indians will require eye care , a staggering 200 million people . 
Today , we 're reaching not even 10 percent of them . 
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence about 30 years back as a post - retirement project of Dr. V. 
He started this with no money . 
He had to mortgage all his life savings to make a bank loan . 
And over time , we have grown into a network of five hospitals , predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry , and then we added several , what we call Vision Centers as a hub - and - spoke model . 
And then more recently we started managing hospitals in other parts of the country and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well . 
The last three decades , we have done about three - and - a - half million surgeries , a vast majority of them for the poor people . 
Now , each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries . 
A typical day at Aravind , we would do about a thousand surgeries , maybe see about 6,000 patients , send out teams into the villages to examine , bring back patients , lots of telemedicine consultations , and , on top of that , do a lot of training , both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind . 
And then doing this day - in and day - out , and doing it well , requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work . 
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by Dr. V. , a value system , an efficient delivery process , and fostering the culture of innovation . 
Dr. V : I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village , and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being , you seem to be one with him . 
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence . 
Doctor , whatever you say , I accept it . 
An implicit faith in you and then you respond to it . 
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me , I must do my best for her . 
When we grow in spiritual consciousness , we identify ourselves with all that is in the world , so there is no exploitation . 
It is ourselves we are helping . 
It is ourselves we are healing . 
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient - centric organization and systems that support it . 
But on a practical level , you also have to deliver services efficiently , and , odd as it may seem , the inspiration came from McDonald 's . 
Dr. V : See , McDonald 's ' concept is simple . 
They feel they can train people all over the world , irrespective of different religions , cultures , all those things , to produce a product in the same way and deliver it in the same manner in hundreds of places . 
Larry Brilliant : He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers , and none of it made any sense to us . 
He wanted to create a franchise , a mechanism of delivery of eye care with the efficiency of McDonald 's . 
Dr. V : Supposing I 'm able to produce eye care , techniques , methods , all in the same way , and make it available in every corner of the world . 
The problem of blindness is gone . 
TR : If you think about it , I think the eyeball is the same , as American or African , the problem is the same , the treatment is the same . 
And yet , why should there be so much variation in quality and in service , and that was the fundamental principle that we followed when we designed the delivery systems . 
And , of course , the challenge was that it 's a huge problem , we are talking of millions of people , very little resource to deal with it , and then lots of logistics and affordability issues . 
And then so , one had to constantly innovate . 
And one of the early innovations , which still continues , is to create ownership in the community to the problem , and then engage with them as a partner , and here is one such event . 
Here a community camp just organized by the community themselves , where they find a place , organize volunteers , and then we 'll do our part . You know , check their vision , and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is and then determine what further testing should be done , and then those tests are done by technicians who check for glasses , or check for glaucoma . 
And then , with all these results , the doctor makes a final diagnosis , and then prescribes a line of treatment , and if they need a pair of glasses , they are available right there at the camp site , usually under a tree . 
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice , and that 's very important because I think glasses , in addition to helping people see , is also a fashion statement , and they 're willing to pay for it . 
So they get it in about 20 minutes and those who require surgery , are counseled , and then there are buses waiting , which will transport them to the base hospital . 
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support , many people like this would probably never get services , and certainly not when they most need it . 
They receive surgery the following day , and then they will stay for a day or two , and then they are put back on the buses to be taken back to where they came from , and where their families will be waiting to take them back home . 
And this happens several thousand times each year . 
It may sound impressive that we 're seeing lots of patients , very efficient process , but we looked at , are we solving the problem ? 
We did a study , a scientifically designed process , and then , to our dismay , we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need , and we 're not adequately addressing more , bigger problems . 
So we had to do something different , so we set up what we call primary eye care centers , vision centers . 
These are truly paperless offices with completely electronic medical records and so on . 
They receive comprehensive eye exams . 
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera , and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor . 
The effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people . 
And the second year went up to 75 percent . 
So I think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it , and in this process of using technology , make sure that most do n't need to come to the base hospital . 
And how much will they pay for this ? 
We fixed the pricing , taking into account what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city , so they pay about 20 rupees , and that 's good for three consultations . 
The other challenge was , how do you give high - tech or more advanced treatment and care ? 
We designed a van with a VSAT , which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed , and then as the patient is waiting , the report goes back to the patient , it gets printed out , the patient gets it , and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing -- I mean , go see a doctor or come back after six months , and then this happens as a way of bridging the technology competence . 
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market , because it focused on the non - customer , and then by reaching the unreached , we 're able to significantly grow the market . 
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently when you have very few ophthalmologists ? 
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating , and then you see on the other side , another patient is getting ready . 
So , as they finish the surgery , they just swing the microscope over , the tables are placed so that their distance is just right , and then we need to do this , because , by doing this kind of process , we 're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon . 
And then to support the surgeon , we require a certain workforce . 
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited , and then they really are the backbone of the organization . 
They do almost all of the skill - based routine tasks . 
They do one thing at a time . They do it extremely well . 
With the result we have very high productivity , very high quality at very , very low cost . 
So , putting all this together , what really happened was the productivity of our staff was significantly higher than anyone else . 
This is a very busy table , but what this really is conveying is that , when it comes to quality , we have put in very good quality - assurance systems . 
As a result , our complications are significantly lower than what has been reported in the United Kingdom , and you do n't see those kind of numbers very often . 
So the final part of the puzzle is , how do you make all this work financially , especially when the people ca n't pay for it ? 
So what we did was , we gave away a lot of it for free , and then those who pay , I mean , they paid local market rates , nothing more , and often much less . 
And we were helped by the market inefficiency . 
I think that has been a big savior , even now . 
And , of course , one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus . 
The result has been , over the years , the expenditure has increased with volumes . 
The revenues increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy margin while you 're treating a large number of people for free . 
I think in absolute terms , last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars , spent about 13 million , with over a 40 percent EBITA . 
But this really requires going beyond what we do , or what we have done , if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness . 
And what we did was a couple of very counter - intuitive things . 
We created competition for ourselves , and then we made eye care affordable by making low - cost consumables . 
We proactively and systematically promoted these practices to many hospitals in India , many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well . 
The impact of this has been that these hospitals , in the second year after our consultation , are double their output and then achieve financial recovery as well . 
The other part was how do you address this increase in cost of technology ? 
There was a time when we failed to negotiate the [ intra - ocular lens ] prices to be at affordable levels , so we set up a manufacturing unit . 
And then , over time , we were able to bring down the cost significantly to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out . 
Today , we believe we have about seven percent of the global market , and they 're used in about 120-odd countries . 
To conclude , I mean , what we do , does it have a broader relevance , or is it just India or developing countries ? 
So to address this , we studied UK versus Aravind . 
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent of the volume of what the UK does , near a half - million surgeries as a whole country . 
And we do about 300,000 . 
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists against the 70 trained by them , comparable quality , both in training and in patient care . 
So we 're really comparing apples to apples . 
We looked at cost . 
So , I think it is simple to say just because the U.K. is n't India the difference is happening . 
I think there is more to it . 
I mean , I think one has to look at other aspects as well . 
Maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity , maybe in efficiency , in the clinical process , or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables , or regulations , their defensive practice . 
So , I think decoding this can probably bring answers to most developed countries including the U.S. , and maybe Obama 's ratings can go up again . 
Another insight , which , again , I want to leave with you , in conditions where the problem is very large , which cuts across all economic strata , where we have a good solution , I think the process I described , you know , productivity , quality , patient - centered care , can give an answer , and there are many which fit this paradigm . 
You take dentistry , hearing aid , maternity and so on . 
There are many where this paradigm can now play , but I think probably one of the most challenging things is on the softer side . 
Now , how do you create compassion ? 
Now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ? 
There are a bit harder issues . 
And I 'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these . 
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you . 
Dr. V : When you grow in spiritual consciousness , we identify with all that is in the world so there is no exploitation . 
It is ourselves we are helping . 
It is ourselves we are healing . 
TR : Thank you very much .

Fabian Hemmert : The shape - shifting future of the mobile phone 
I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question : how can we make digital content graspable ? 
Because you see , on the one hand , there is the digital world and no question , many things are happening there right now . 
And for us humans , it 's not quite material , it 's not really there -- it 's virtual . 
On the other hand , we humans , we live in a physical world . 
It 's rich , it tastes good , it feels good , it smells good . 
So the question is : how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical ? 
That 's my question . 
If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity , you can see the tendency ; it 's getting physical . 
The question is : what 's next ? 
Now , I have three options that I would like to show you . 
The first one is mass . 
As humans , we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy . 
So , could we use that in mobile phones ? 
Let me show you the weight - shifting mobile . 
It is a mobile phone - shaped box that has an iron weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it 's heavy . 
We shift the gravitational center of it . 
For example , we can augment digital content with physical mass . 
So you move around the content on a display , but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device . 
Another thing it 's good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city . 
It can tell you by its weight , " Okay , move right . Walk ahead . Make a left here . " 
And the good thing about that is you do n't have to look at the device all the time ; you have your eyes free to see the city . 
Now , mass is the first thing ; the second thing , that 's shape . 
We 're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in [ our ] hands . 
So if I download an e - book and it has 20 pages -- well , they could be thin , right -- but if it has 500 pages , I want to feel that " Harry Potter " -- it 's thick . 
So let me show you the shape - changing mobile . 
Again , it 's a mobile phone - shaped box , and this one can change its shape . 
We can play with the shape itself . 
For example , it can be thin in your pocket , which we of course want it to be ; but then if you hold it in your hand , it can lean towards you , be thick . 
It 's like tapered to the downside . 
If you change the grasp , it can adjust to that . 
It 's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock , it stands . 
It 's fairly simple . 
Another thing is , sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone , they are bigger than the phone itself . 
So in that case -- like here , there 's an app that 's bigger than the phone 's screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you , " Okay , off the screen right here , there is more content . 
You ca n't see it , but it 's there . " 
And you can feel that because it 's thicker at that edge . 
The shape is the second thing . 
The third thing operates on a different level . 
As humans , we are social , we are empathic , and that 's great . 
Would n't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive ? 
Think of a hamster in the pocket . 
Well , I can feel it , it 's doing all right -- I do n't have to check it . 
Let me show you the living mobile phone . 
So , once again , mobile phone - shaped box , but this one , it has a breath and a heartbeat , and it feels very organic . 
And you can tell , it 's relaxed right now . 
Oh now , missed call , a new call , new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting . 
How do we calm it down ? 
You give it a pat behind the ears , and everything is all right again . 
So , that 's very intuitive , and that 's what we want . 
So , what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us . 
And I think making it physical is a good way to do that . 
What 's behind that is a postulation , namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future ; rather than that , technology , a bit more human .

Sue Austin : Deep sea diving … in a wheelchair 
It 's wonderful to be here to talk about my journey , to talk about the wheelchair and the freedom it has bought me . 
I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago when an extended illness changed the way I could access the world . 
When I started using the wheelchair , it was a tremendous new freedom . 
I 'd seen my life slip away and become restricted . 
It was like having an enormous new toy . 
I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again . 
Just being out on the street was exhilarating . 
But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom , people 's reaction completely changed towards me . 
It was as if they could n't see me anymore , as if an invisibility cloak had descended . 
They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair . 
When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair , they used words like " limitation , " " fear , " " pity " and " restriction . " 
I realized I 'd internalized these responses and it had changed who I was on a core level . 
A part of me had become alienated from myself . 
I was seeing myself not from my perspective , but vividly and continuously from the perspective of other people 's responses to me . 
As a result , I knew I needed to make my own stories about this experience , new narratives to reclaim my identity . 
[ " Finding Freedom : ' By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do ' official ' narratives . ' — Davis 2009 , TEDx Women " ] I started making work that aimed to communicate something of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair -- a power chair -- to negotiate the world . 
I was working to transform these internalized responses , to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped my identity when I started using a wheelchair , by creating unexpected images . 
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with . 
When I literally started leaving traces of my joy and freedom , it was exciting to see the interested and surprised responses from people . 
It seemed to open up new perspectives , and therein lay the paradigm shift . 
It showed that an arts practice can remake one 's identity and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar . 
So when I began to dive , in 2005 , I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity in just the same way as a wheelchair does , but the associations attached to scuba gear are ones of excitement and adventure , completely different to people 's responses to the wheelchair . 
So I thought , " I wonder what 'll happen if I put the two together ? " 
And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted has taken me on the most amazing journey over the last seven years . 
So to give you an idea of what that 's like , I 'd like to share with you one of the outcomes from creating this spectacle , and show you what an amazing journey it 's taken me on . 
It is the most amazing experience , beyond most other things I 've experienced in life . 
I literally have the freedom to move in 360 degrees of space and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom . 
And the incredibly unexpected thing is that other people seem to see and feel that too . 
Their eyes literally light up , and they say things like , " I want one of those , " or , " If you can do that , I can do anything . " 
And I 'm thinking , it 's because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for , or so transcends the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair , they have to think in a completely new way . 
And I think that moment of completely new thought perhaps creates a freedom that spreads to the rest of other people 's lives . 
For me , this means that they 're seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives . 
For me , the wheelchair becomes a vehicle for transformation . 
In fact , I now call the underwater wheelchair " Portal , " because it 's literally pushed me through into a new way of being , into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness . 
And the other thing is , that because nobody 's seen or heard of an underwater wheelchair before , and creating this spectacle is about creating new ways of seeing , being and knowing , now you have this concept in your mind . 
You 're all part of the artwork too .

Stewart Brand proclaims 4 environmental ' heresies ' 
Because of what I 'm about to say , I really should establish my green credentials . 
When I was a small boy , I took my pledge as an American , to save and faithfully defend from waste the natural resources of my country , its air , soil and minerals , its forests , waters and wildlife . 
And I 've stuck to that . 
Stanford , I majored in ecology and evolution . 
1968 , I put out the Whole Earth Catalog . Was " mister natural " for a while . 
And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration . 
The Brown administration , and a bunch of my friends , basically leveled the energy efficiency of California , so it 's the same now , 30 years later , even though our economy has gone up 80 percent , per capita . 
And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state . 
California is basically the equivalent of Europe , in this . 
This year , Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I 'll preview today , called Whole Earth Discipline . 
The dominant demographic event of our time is this screamingly rapid urbanization that we have going on . 
By mid - century we 'll be about 80 percent urban , and that 's mostly in the developing world , where that 's happening . 
It 's interesting , because history is driven to a large degree by the size of cities . 
The developing world now has all of the biggest cities , and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries , and nine times bigger . 
It 's qualitatively different . 
They are the drivers of history , as we see by looking at history . 
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like . 
Well we now have a distribution of urban power similar to what we had 1,000 years ago . 
In other words , the rise of the West , dramatic as it was , is over . 
The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming : 1.3 million people a week coming to town , decade after decade . 
What 's really going on ? 
Well , what 's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out . 
Subsistence farming is drying up basically . 
People are following opportunity into town . 
And this is why . 
I used to have a very romantic idea about villages , and it 's because I never lived in one . 
Because in town -- this is the bustling squatter city of Kibera , near Nairobi -- they see action . They see opportunity . 
They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in back in the subsistence farm . 
As you go around these places there 's plenty of aesthetics . 
There is plenty going on . 
They are poor , but they are intensely urban . And they are intensely creative . 
The aggregate numbers now are that basically squatters , all one billion of them , are building the urban world , which means they 're building the world -- personally , one by one , family by family , clan by clan , neighborhood by neighborhood . 
They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by . 
They even build their own infrastructure . 
Well , steal their own infrastructure , at first . 
Cable TV , water , the whole gamut , all gets stolen . 
And then gradually gentrifies . 
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity , not the working slums ; they help create prosperity . 
So in a town like Mumbai , which is half slums , it 's 1/6th of the GDP of India . 
Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense . 
These people are valuable as a group . 
And that 's how they work . 
There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people , " Oh there 's terrible things . We 've got to fix their housing . " 
It used to be , " Oh we 've got to get them phone service . " 
Now they 're showing us how they do their phone service . 
Famine mostly is a rural event now . 
There are things they care about . 
And this is where we can help . 
And the nations they 're in can help . 
And they are helping each other solve these issues . 
And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai . 
You look at that lane on the right . 
And you can ask , " Okay what 's going on there ? " 
The answer is , " Everything . " 
This is better than a mall . It 's much denser . 
It 's much more interactive . 
And the scale is terrific . 
The main event is , these are not people crushed by poverty . 
These are people busy getting out of poverty just as fast as they can . 
They 're helping each other do it . 
They 're doing it through an outlaw thing , the informal economy . 
The informal economy , it 's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics : it 's not supposed to be there , but it 's huge . 
We do n't understand how it works yet , but we have to . 
Furthermore , people in the informal economy , the gray economy -- as time goes by , crime is happening around them . And they can join the criminal world , or they can join the legitimate world . 
We should be able to make that choice easier for them to get toward the legitimate world , because if we do n't , they will go toward the criminal world . 
There 's all kinds of activity . 
In Dharavi the slum performs not only a lot of services for itself , but it performs services for the city at large . 
And one of the main events are these ad - hoc schools . 
Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers to a private , tiny , unofficial school . 
Education is more possible in the cities , and that changes the world . 
So you see some interesting , typical , urban things . 
So one thing slammed up against another , such as in Sao Paulo here . 
That 's what cities do . That 's how they create value , is by slamming things together . 
In this case , supply right next to demand . 
So the maids and the gardeners and the guards that live in this lively part of town on the left walk to work , in the boring , rich neighborhood . 
Proximity is amazing . 
We are learning about how dense proximity can be . 
Connectivity between the city and the country is what 's going to keep the country good , because the city has interesting ways of doing things . 
This is what makes cities -- this is what makes cities so green in the developing world . 
Because people leave the poverty trap , an ecological disaster of subsistence farms , and head to town . 
And when they 're gone the natural environment starts to come back very rapidly . 
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops to send food to the new growing markets in town . 
So if you want to save a village , you do it with a good road , or with a good cell phone connection , and ideally some grid electrical power . 
So the event is : we 're a city planet . That just happened . 
More than half . 
The numbers are considerable . A billion live in the squatter cities now . 
Another billion is expected . 
That 's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way . 
And that will determine a lot of how we function . 
Now , for us environmentalists , maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb . 
People get into town . 
The immediately have fewer children . 
They do n't even have to get rich yet . Just the opportunity of coming up in the world means they will have fewer , higher - quality kids , and the birthrate goes down radically . 
Very interesting side effect here , here 's a slide from Phillip Longman . 
Shows what is happening . 
As we have more and more old people , like me , and fewer and fewer babies . 
And they are regionally separated . 
What you 're getting is a world which is old folks , and old cities , going around doing things the old way , in the north . 
And young people in brand new cities they 're inventing , doing new things , in the south . 
Where do you think the action is going to be ? 
Shift of subject . Quickly drop by climate . 
The climate news , I 'm sorry to say , is going to keep getting worse than we think , faster than we think . 
Climate is a profoundly complex , nonlinear system , full of runaway positive feedbacks , hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points . 
Here 's just a few samples . 
We 're going to keep being surprised . And almost all the surprises are going to be bad ones . 
From your standpoint this means a great increase in climate refugees over the coming decades , and what goes along with that , which is resource wars and chaos wars , as we 're seeing in Darfur . 
That 's what drought does . 
It brings carrying capacity down , and there 's not enough carrying capacity to support the people . And then you 're in trouble . 
Shift to the power situation . 
Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city , or a city planet . 
So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity : coal , some gas , nuclear and hydro . 
Of those , only nuclear and hydro are green . 
Coal is what is causing the climate problems . 
And everyone will keep burning it because it 's so cheap , until governments make it expensive . 
Wind and solar ca n't help , because so far we do n't have a way to store that energy . 
So with hydro maxed out , coal and lose the climate , or nuclear , which is the current operating low - carbon source , and maybe save the climate . 
And if we can eventually get good solar in space , that also could help . 
Because remember , this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world in the villages and in the cities . 
So , between coal and nuclear , compare their waste products . 
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear , the amount of waste that would be added up would fit in a Coke can . 
Whereas a coal - burning plant , a normal one gigawatt coal plant , burns 80 rail cars of coal a day , each car having 100 tons . 
And it puts 18 thousand tons of carbon dioxide in the air . 
So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions of these various energy forms , nuclear is about even with solar and wind , and ahead of solar -- oh , I 'm sorry -- with hydro and wind , and ahead of solar . 
And does nuclear really compete with coal ? 
Just ask the coal miners in Australia . 
That 's where you see some of the source , not from my fellow environmentalists , but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power . 
Well the good news is that the developing world , but frankly , the whole world , is busy building , and starting to build , nuclear reactors . 
This is good for the atmosphere . 
It 's good for their prosperity . 
I want to point out one interesting thing , which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower . 
It 's supposed to be , I do n't know , local solar and wind and cogeneration , and good things like that . 
But frankly micro - reactors which are just now coming on , might serve even better . 
The Russians , who started this , are building floating reactors , for their new passage , where the ice is melting , north of Russia . 
And they 're selling these floating reactors , only 35 megawatts , to developing countries . 
Here 's the design of an early one from Toshiba . 
It 's interesting , say , to take a 25-megawatt , 25 million watts , and you compare it to the standard big iron of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva , which is 1.2 , 1.6 billion watts . 
These things are way smaller . They 're much more adaptable . 
Here 's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab . 
Here 's another American design that came out of Los Alamos , and is now commercial . 
Almost all of these are not only small , they are proliferation - proof . 
They 're typically buried in the ground . 
And the innovation is moving very rapidly . 
So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future . 
In terms of proliferation , nuclear energy has done more to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity . 
And that 's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room , 20 percent of electricity in this room is probably nuclear . 
Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia , soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads . 
And so I would like to see the GNEP program , that was developed in the Bush administration , go forward aggressively . 
And I was glad to see that president Obama supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy when he spoke in Prague the other week . 
One more subject . Genetically engineered food crops , in my view , as a biologist , have no reason to be controversial . 
My fellow environmentalists , on this subject , have been irrational , anti - scientific , and very harmful . 
Despite their best efforts , genetically engineered crops are the most rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history . 
They 're good for the environment because they enable no - till farming , which leaves the soil in place , getting healthier from year to year -- slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil into the atmosphere . 
They reduce pesticide use . 
And they increase yield , which allows you to have your agricultural area be smaller , and therefore more wild area is freed up . 
By the way , this map from 2006 is out of date because it shows Africa still under the thumb of Greenpeace , and Friends of the Earth from Europe , and they 're finally getting out from under that . 
And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa , at last . 
This is a moral issue . 
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics met on this issue twice in great detail and said it is a moral imperative to make genetically engineered crops readily available . 
Speaking of imperatives , geoengineering is taboo now , especially in government circles , though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago , but it will be on your plate -- not this year but pretty soon , because some harsh realizations are coming along . 
This is a list of them . 
Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary . 
There will be events , like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave , which happened a while back . 
Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh . 
Like wars over water , such as in the Indus . 
And as those events keep happening we 're going to say , " Okay , what can we do about that really ? " 
But there 's this little problem with geoengineering : what body is going to decide who gets to engineer ? How much they do ? Where they do it ? 
Because everybody is downstream , downwind of whatever is done . 
And if we just taboo it completely we could lose civilization . 
But if we just say " OK , China , you 're worried , you go ahead . 
You geoengineer your way . We 'll geoengineer our way . " 
That would be considered an act of war by both nations . 
So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along . 
I should say , it is more practical than people think . 
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot , one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas . 
This one came from the sulfur dioxide from Mount Pinatubo in 1991 -- cooled the earth by half a degree . 
There was so much ice in 1992 , the following year , that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs who were known as the Pinatubo cubs . 
To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year . 
That 's nothing , compared to all of the other things we may be trying to do about energy . 
Just to run by another one : this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds , by atomizing seawater ; that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet . 
A nice one , because it can happen lots of little ways in lots of little places , is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians who made good agricultural soil by pyrolizing , smoldering , plant waste , and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon while it 's improving the soil . 
So here is where we are . 
Nobel Prize - winning climatologist Paul Crutzen calls our geological era the Anthropocene , the human - dominated era . We are stuck with its obligations . 
In the Whole Earth Catalog , my first words were , " We are as Gods , and might as well get good at it . " 
The first words of Whole Earth Discipline are , " We are as Gods , and have to get good at it . " 
Thank you . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/naomi_klein_addicted_to_risk.html 
Days before this talk , journalist Naomi Klein was on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico , looking at the catastrophic results of BP 's risky pursuit of oil . Our societies have become addicted to extreme risk in finding new energy , new financial instruments and more ... and too often , we 're left to clean up a mess afterward . Klein 's question : What 's the backup plan ? 
activism , business , culture , economics , science , social change

Naomi Klein : Addicted to risk 
I just did something I 've never done before . 
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel . 
Now I 'm not a scientist , but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team from the University of South Florida who have been tracking the travels of BP 's oil in the Gulf of Mexico . 
This is the boat we were on , by the way . 
The scientists I was with were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff -- the birds , the turtles , the dolphins , the glamorous stuff . 
They 're looking at the really little stuff that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff . 
And what they 're finding is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants can be highly toxic to phytoplankton , which is very bad news , because so much life depends on it . 
So contrary to what we heard a few months back about how 75 percent of that oil sort of magically disappeared and we did n't have to worry about it , this disaster is still unfolding . 
It 's still working its way up the food chain . 
Now this should n't come as a surprise to us . 
Rachel Carson -- the godmother of modern environmentalism -- warned us about this very thing back in 1962 . 
She pointed out that the " control men " -- as she called them -- who carpet - bombed towns and fields with toxic insecticides like DDT , were only trying to kill the little stuff , the insects , not the birds . 
But they forgot this : the fact that birds dine on grubs , that robins eat lots of worms now saturated with DDT . 
And so , robin eggs failed to hatch , songbirds died en masse , towns fell silent . 
Thus the title " Silent Spring . " 
I 've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico , because I 'm Canadian , and I can draw no ancestral ties . 
And I think what it is is I do n't think we have fully come to terms with the meaning of this disaster , with what it meant to witness a hole ripped in our world , with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth gush forth on live TV , 24 hours a day , for months . 
After telling ourselves for so long that our tools and technology can control nature , suddenly we were face - to - face with our weakness , with our lack of control , as the oil burst out of every attempt to contain it -- " top hats , " " top kills " and , most memorably , the " junk shot " -- the bright idea of firing old tires and golf balls down that hole in the world . 
But even more striking than the ferocious power emanating from that well was the recklessness with which that power was unleashed -- the carelessness , the lack of planning that characterized the operation from drilling to clean - up . 
If there is one thing BP 's watery improv act made clear , it is that , as a culture , we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable , and to do so without a back - up plan , without an exit strategy . 
And BP was hardly our first experience of this in recent years . 
Our leaders barrel into wars , telling themselves happy stories about cakewalks and welcome parades . 
Then , it is years of deadly damage control , Frankensteins of sieges and surges and counter - insurgencies , and once again , no exit strategy . 
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim to similar overconfidence , convincing themselves that the latest bubble is a new kind of market -- the kind that never goes down . 
And when it inevitably does , the best and the brightest reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot -- in this case , throwing massive amounts of much - needed public money down a very different kind of hole . 
As with BP , the hole does get plugged , at least temporarily , but not before exacting a tremendous price . 
We have to figure out why we keep letting this happen , because we are in the midst of what may be our highest - stakes gamble of all -- deciding what to do , or not to do , about climate change . 
Now as you know , a great deal of time is spent , in this country and around the world , inside the climate debate , on the question of , " What if the IPC scientists are all wrong ? " 
Now a far more relevant question -- as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it -- is , " What if those scientists are right ? " 
Given the stakes , the climate crisis clearly calls for us to act based on the precautionary principle -- the theory that holds that when human health and the environment are significantly at risk and when the potential damage is irreversible , we can not afford to wait for perfect scientific certainty . 
Better to err on the side of caution . 
More overt , the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed , but rather on the industry that stands to profit . 
But climate policy in the wealthy world -- to the extent that such a thing exists -- is not based on precaution , but rather on cost - benefit analysis -- finding the course of action that economists believe will have the least impact on our GDP . 
So rather than asking , as precaution would demand , what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe , we ask bizarre questions like this : " What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions ? 
Can we put this off till 2020 , 2030 , 2050 ? " 
Or we ask , " How much hotter can we let the planet get and still survive ? 
Can we go with two degrees , three degrees , or -- where we 're currently going -- four degrees Celsius ? " 
And by the way , the assumption that we can safely control the Earth 's awesomely complex climate system as if it had a thermostat , making the planet not too hot , not too cold , but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style -- this is pure fantasy , and it 's not coming from the climate scientists . 
It 's coming from the economists imposing their mechanistic thinking on the science . 
The fact is that we simply do n't know when the warming that we create will be utterly overwhelmed by feedback loops . 
So once again , why do we take these crazy risks with the precious ? 
A range of explanations may be popping into your mind by now , like " greed . " 
This is a popular explanation , and there 's lots of truth to it , because taking big risks , as we all know , pays a lot of money . 
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris . 
And greed and hubris are intimately intertwined when it comes to recklessness . 
For instance , if you happen to be a 35-year - old banker taking home 100 times more than a brain surgeon , then you need a narrative , you need a story that makes that disparity okay . 
And you actually do n't have a lot of options . 
You 're either an incredibly good scammer , and you 're getting away with it -- you gamed the system -- or you 're some kind of boy genius , the likes of which the world has never seen . 
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer -- are going to make you vastly overconfident and therefore more prone to taking even bigger risks in the future . 
By the way , Tony Hayward , the former CEO of BP , had a plaque on his desk inscribed with this inspirational slogan : " What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail ? " 
Now this is actually a popular plaque , and this is a crowd of overachievers , so I 'm betting that some of you have this plaque . 
Do n't feel ashamed . 
Putting fear of failure out of your mind can be a very good thing if you 're training for a triathlon or preparing to give a TEDTalk , but personally , I think people with the power to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology would do better having a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall , because -- maybe not that one in particular -- but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure all of the time . 
So we have greed , we 've got overconfidence / hubris , but since we 're here at TEDWomen , let 's consider one other factor that could be contributing in some small way to societal recklessness . 
Now I 'm not going to belabor this point , but studies do show that , as investors , women are much less prone to taking reckless risks than men , precisely because , as we 've already heard , women tend not to suffer from overconfidence in the same way that men do . 
So it turns out that being paid less and praised less has its upsides -- for society at least . 
The flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted , chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides . 
And this problem -- call it the " perils of privilege " -- brings us closer , I think , to the root of our collective recklessness . 
Because none of us -- at least in the global North -- neither men nor women , are fully exempt from this message . 
Here 's what I 'm talking about . 
Whether we actively believe them or consciously reject them , our culture remains in the grips of certain archetypal stories about our supremacy over others and over nature -- the narrative of the newly discovered frontier and the conquering pioneer , the narrative of manifest destiny , the narrative of apocalypse and salvation . 
And just when you think these stories are fading into history , and that we 've gotten over them , they pop up in the strangest places . 
For instance , I stumbled across this advertisement outside the women 's washroom in the Kansas City airport . 
It 's for Motorola 's new Rugged cell phone , and yes , it really does say , " Slap Mother Nature in the face . " 
And I 'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola -- that 's just a bonus . 
I 'm showing it because -- they 're not a sponsor , are they ? -- because , in its own way , this is a crass version of our founding story . 
We slapped Mother Nature around and won , and we always win , because dominating nature is our destiny . 
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature . 
There 's another one , equally important , about how that very same Mother Nature is so nurturing and so resilient that we can never make a dent in her abundance . 
Let 's hear from Tony Hayward again . 
" The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean . 
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume . " 
In other words , the ocean is big ; she can take it . 
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do . 
Because this is our real master - narrative : however much we mess up , there will always be more -- more water , more land , more untapped resources . 
A new bubble will replace the old one . 
A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one . 
In a way , that is the story of the settling of the Americas , the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped . 
And it 's also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth from this land that gave birth to our economic system , one that can not survive without perpetual growth and an unending supply of new frontiers . 
Now the problem is that the story was always a lie . 
The Earth always did have limits . 
They were just beyond our sights . 
And now we are hitting those limits on multiple fronts . 
I believe that we know this , yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop . 
Not only do we continue to tell and retell the same tired stories , but we are now doing so with a frenzy and a fury that , frankly , verges on camp . 
How else to explain the cultural space occupied by Sarah Palin ? 
Now on the one hand , exhorting us to " drill , baby , drill , " because God put those resources into the ground in order for us to exploit them , and on the other , glorying in the wilderness of Alaska 's untouched beauty on her hit reality TV show . 
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad . 
Ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall . 
There are still no limits . 
There will always be another frontier . 
So stop worrying and keep shopping . 
Now , would that this were just about Sarah Palin and her reality TV show . 
In environmental circles , we often hear that , rather than shifting to renewables , we are continuing with business as usual . 
This assessment , unfortunately , is far too optimistic . 
The truth is that we have already exhausted so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels that we have already entered a far riskier business era , the era of extreme energy . 
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water , including the icy Arctic seas , where a clean - up may simply be impossible . 
It means large - scale hydraulic fracking for gas and massive strip - mining operations for coal , the likes of which we have n't yet seen . 
And most controversially , it means the tar sands . 
I 'm always surprised by how little people outside of Canada know about the Alberta Tar Sands , which this year are projected to become the number one source of imported oil to the United States . 
It 's worth taking a moment to understand this practice , because I believe it speaks to recklessness and the path we 're on like little else . 
So this is where the tar sands live , under one of the last magnificent Boreal forests . 
The oil is not liquid . 
You ca n't just drill a hole and pump it out . 
Tar sand 's oil is solid , mixed in with the soil . 
So to get at it , you first have to get rid of the trees . 
Then , you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand . 
The process requires a huge amount of water , which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds . 
That 's very bad news for local indigenous people living downstream who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates . 
Now looking at these images , it 's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation , which can already be seen from space and could grow to an area the size of England . 
I find it helps actually to look at the dump trucks that move the earth , the largest ever built . 
That 's a person down there by the wheel . 
My point is that this is not oil drilling . 
It 's not even mining . 
It is terrestrial skinning . 
Vast , vivid landscapes are being gutted , left monochromatic gray . 
Now I should confess that as [ far as ] I 'm concerned this would be an abomination if it emitted not one particle of carbon . 
But the truth is that , on average , turning that gunk into crude oil produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution than it does to produce conventional oil in Canada . 
How else to describe this , but as a form of mass insanity ? 
Just when we know we need to be learning to live on the surface of our planet , off the power of sun , wind and waves , we are frantically digging to get at the dirtiest , highest - emitting stuff imaginable . 
This is where our story of endless growth has taken us , to this black hole at the center of my country -- a place of such planetary pain that , like the BP gusher , one can only stand to look at it for so long . 
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us , this is how civilizations commit suicide , by slamming their foot on the accelerator at the exact moment when they should be putting on the brakes . 
The problem is that our master - narrative has an answer for that too . 
At the very last minute , we are going to get saved just like in every Hollywood movie , just like in the Rapture . 
But , of course , our secular religion is technology . 
Now , you may have noticed more and more headlines like these . 
The idea behind this form of " geoengineering " as it 's called , is that , as the planet heats up , we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles into the stratosphere to reflect some of the sun 's rays back to space , thereby cooling the planet . 
The wackiest plan -- and I 'm not making this up -- would put what is essentially a garden hose 18-and - a - half miles high into the sky , suspended by balloons , to spew sulfur dioxide . 
So , solving the problem of pollution with more pollution . 
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot . 
The serious scientists involved in this research all stress that these techniques are entirely untested . 
They do n't know if they 'll work , and they have no idea what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash . 
Nevertheless , the mere mention of geoengineering is being greeted in some circles , particularly media circles , with a relief tinged with euphoria . 
An escape hatch has been reached . 
A new frontier has been found . 
Most importantly , we do n't have to change our lifestyles after all . 
You see , for some people , their savior is a guy in a flowing robe . 
For other people , it 's a guy with a garden hose . 
We badly need some new stories . 
We need stories that have different kinds of heroes willing to take different kinds of risks -- risks that confront recklessness head on , that put the precautionary principle into practice , even if that means through direct action -- like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested , blocking dirty power plants or fighting mountaintop - removal coal mining . 
We need stories that replace that linear narrative of endless growth with circular narratives that remind us that what goes around comes around . 
That this is our only home . 
There is no escape hatch . 
Call it karma , call it physics , action and reaction , call it precaution -- the principle that reminds us that life is too precious to be risked for any profit . 
Thank you .

John Graham - Cumming : The greatest machine that never was 
So the machine I 'm going to talk you about is what I call the greatest machine that never was . 
It was a machine that was never built , and yet , it will be built . 
It was a machine that was designed long before anyone thought about computers . 
If you know anything about the history of computers , you will know that in the ' 30s and the ' 40s , simple computers were created that started the computer revolution we have today , and you would be correct , except for you 'd have the wrong century . 
The first computer was really designed in the 1830s and 1840s , not the 1930s and 1940s . 
It was designed , and parts of it were prototyped , and the bits of it that were built are here in South Kensington . 
That machine was built by this guy , Charles Babbage . 
Now , I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage because his hair is always completely unkempt like this in every single picture . 
He was a very wealthy man , and a sort of , part of the aristocracy of Britain , and on a Saturday night in Marylebone , were you part of the intelligentsia of that period , you would have been invited round to his house for a soiree — and he invited everybody : kings , the Duke of Wellington , many , many famous people — and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines . 
I really miss that era , you know , where you could go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer get demonstrated to you . 
But Babbage , Babbage himself was born at the end of the 18th century , and was a fairly famous mathematician . 
He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge , and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking . 
He 's less well known than either of them because he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices and never made any of them . 
The reason he never made any of them , he 's a classic nerd . 
Every time he had a good idea , he 'd think , " That 's brilliant , I 'm going to start building that one . 
I 'll spend a fortune on it . I 've got a better idea . 
I 'm going to work on this one . And I 'm going to do this one . " 
He did this until Sir Robert Peel , then Prime Minister , basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street , and kicking him out , in those days , that meant saying , " I bid you good day , sir . " 
The thing he designed was this monstrosity here , the analytical engine . Now , just to give you an idea of this , this is a view from above . 
Every one of these circles is a cog , a stack of cogs , and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive . 
So as I go through this talk , I want you to imagine this gigantic machine . We heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like . 
And I 'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that 's why it 's computer architecture — and tell you about this machine , which is a computer . 
So let 's talk about the memory . The memory is very like the memory of a computer today , except it was all made out of metal , stacks and stacks of cogs , 30 cogs high . 
Imagine a thing this high of cogs , hundreds and hundreds of them , and they 've got numbers on them . 
It 's a decimal machine . Everything 's done in decimal . 
And he thought about using binary . The problem with using binary is that the machine would have been so tall , it would have been ridiculous . As it is , it 's enormous . 
So he 's got memory . 
The memory is this bit over here . 
You see it all like this . 
This monstrosity over here is the CPU , the chip , if you like . 
Of course , it 's this big . 
Completely mechanical . This whole machine is mechanical . 
This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU which is in the Science Museum . 
The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic -- so addition , multiplication , subtraction , division -- which already is a bit of a feat in metal , but it could also do something that a computer does and a calculator does n't : this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision . 
It could do the " if then " for basic programmers , and that fundamentally made it into a computer . 
It could compute . It could n't just calculate . It could do more . 
Now , if we look at this , and we stop for a minute , and we think about chips today , we ca n't look inside a silicon chip . It 's just so tiny . 
Yet if you did , you would see something very , very similar to this . 
There 's this incredible complexity in the CPU , and this incredible regularity in the memory . 
If you 've ever seen an electron microscope picture , you 'll see this . This all looks the same , then there 's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated . 
All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does , but of course you need to program this thing , and of course , Babbage used the technology of the day and the technology that would reappear in the ' 50s , ' 60s and ' 70s , which is punch cards . This thing over here is one of three punch card readers in here , and this is a program in the Science Museum , just not far from here , created by Charles Babbage , that is sitting there — you can go see it — waiting for the machine to be built . 
And there 's not just one of these , there 's many of them . 
He prepared programs anticipating this would happen . 
Now , the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard , in France , had created the Jacquard loom , which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards , so he was just repurposing the technology of the day , and like everything else he did , he 's using the technology of his era , so 1830s , 1840s , 1850s , cogs , steam , mechanical devices . Ironically , born the same year as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday , who would completely revolutionize everything with the dynamo , transformers , all these sorts of things . 
Babbage , of course , wanted to use proven technology , so steam and things . 
Now , he needed accessories . 
Obviously , you 've got a computer now . 
You 've got punch cards , a CPU and memory . 
You need accessories you 're going to come with . 
You 're not just going to have that , So , first of all , you had sound . You had a bell , so if anything went wrong — — or the machine needed the attendant to come to it , there was a bell it could ring . 
And there 's actually an instruction on the punch card which says " Ring the bell . " So you can imagine this " Ting ! " 
You know , just stop for a moment , imagine all those noises , this thing , " Click , clack click click click , " steam engine , " Ding , " right ? 
You also need a printer , obviously , and everyone needs a printer . 
This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for another machine of his , called the Difference Engine No . 2 , which he never built , but which the Science Museum did build in the ' 80s and ' 90s . 
It 's completely mechanical , again , a printer . 
It prints just numbers , because he was obsessed with numbers , but it does print onto paper , and it even does word wrapping , so if you get to the end of the line , it goes around like that . 
You also need graphics , right ? 
I mean , if you 're going to do anything with graphics , so he said , " Well , I need a plotter . I 've got a big piece of paper and an ink pen and I 'll make it plot . " 
So he designed a plotter as well , and , you know , at that point , I think he got pretty much a pretty good machine . 
Along comes this woman , Ada Lovelace . 
Now , imagine these soirees , all these great and good comes along . 
This lady is the daughter of the mad , bad and dangerous - to - know Lord Byron , and her mother , being a bit worried that she might have inherited some of Lord Byron 's madness and badness , thought , " I know the solution : Mathematics is the solution . 
We 'll teach her mathematics . That 'll calm her down . " 
Because of course , there 's never been a mathematician that 's gone crazy , so , you know , that 'll be fine . 
Everything'll be fine . So she 's got this mathematical training , and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother , and Charles Babbage , you know , gets out his machine . 
The Duke of Wellington is there , you know , get out the machine , obviously demonstrates it , and she gets it . She 's the only person in his lifetime , really , who said , " I understand what this does , and I understand the future of this machine . " 
And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build because of her . 
Now , some people call her the first programmer . 
This is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated . 
This is a program written in a particular style . 
It 's not , historically , totally accurate that she 's the first programmer , and actually , she did something more amazing . 
Rather than just being a programmer , she saw something that Babbage did n't . 
Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics . 
He was building a machine to do mathematics , and Lovelace said , " You could do more than mathematics on this machine . " And just as you do , everyone in this room already 's got a computer on them right now , because they 've got a phone . 
If you go into that phone , every single thing in that phone or computer or any other computing device is mathematics . It 's all numbers at the bottom . 
Whether it 's video or text or music or voice , it 's all numbers , it 's all , underlying it , mathematical functions happening , and Lovelace said , " Just because you 're doing mathematical functions and symbols does n't mean these things ca n't represent other things in the real world , such as music . " 
This was a huge leap , because Babbage is there saying , " We could compute these amazing functions and print out tables of numbers and draw graphs , " — — and Lovelace is there and she says , " Look , this thing could even compose music if you told it a representation of music numerically . " 
So this is what I call Lovelace 's Leap . 
When you say she 's a programmer , she did do some , but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be much , much more than this . 
Now , a hundred years later , this guy comes along , Alan Turing , and in 1936 , and invents the computer all over again . 
Now , of course , Babbage 's machine was entirely mechanical . 
Turing 's machine was entirely theoretical . 
Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective , but Turing told us something very important . 
He laid down the mathematical foundations for computer science , and said , " It does n't matter how you make a computer . " 
It does n't matter if your computer 's mechanical , like Babbage 's was , or electronic , like computers are today , or perhaps in the future , cells , or , again , mechanical again , once we get into nanotechnology . 
We could go back to Babbage 's machine and just make it tiny . All those things are computers . 
There is in a sense a computing essence . 
This is called the Church – Turing thesis . 
And so suddenly , you get this link where you say this thing Babbage had built really was a computer . 
In fact , it was capable of doing everything we do today with computers , only really slowly . 
To give you an idea of how slowly , it had about 1k of memory . 
It used punch cards , which were being fed in , and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81 . 
It did have a RAM pack . 
You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to . 
So , where does that bring us today ? 
So there are plans . 
Over in Swindon , the Science Museum archives , there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine . 
One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28 , and that is also the name of a charity that I started with Doron Swade , who was the curator of computing at the Science Museum , and also the person who drove the project to build a difference engine , and our plan is to build it . 
Here in South Kensington , we will build the analytical engine . 
The project has a number of parts to it . 
One was the scanning of Babbage 's archive . 
That 's been done . The second is now the study of all of those plans to determine what to build . 
The third part is a computer simulation of that machine , and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum . 
When it 's built , you 'll finally be able to understand how a computer works , because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you , you 've got to look at this humongous thing and say , " Ah , I see the memory operating , I see the CPU operating , I hear it operating . I probably smell it operating . " 
But in between that we 're going to do a simulation . 
Babbage himself wrote , he said , as soon as the analytical engine exists , it will surely guide the future course of science . 
Of course , he never built it , because he was always fiddling with new plans , but when it did get built , of course , in the 1940s , everything changed . 
Now , I 'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like in motion with a video which shows just one part of the CPU mechanism working . 
So this is just three sets of cogs , and it 's going to add . This is the adding mechanism in action , so you imagine this gigantic machine . 
So , give me five years . 
Before the 2030s happen , we 'll have it . 
Thank you very much .

Yann Arthus - Bertrand captures fragile Earth in wide - angle 
I have a big impact on the planet to travel here by plane . 
I emitted , in the atmosphere , nine tons of CO2 ; that is the weight of two elephants . 
I came here to speak about ecology , and I emitted as much CO2 as a Frenchman in one year . 
So what do I have to do ? 
I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home ? 
I have to do my carbon offset in another way , like I do every time . 
In fact my work is to show our impact on our planet . 
I 'm going to show you some examples of the last pictures I 've done in the last year . 
Alberta sand oil , a lot of pollution . 
You know the problem ; we do n't want to believe what we know . 
In Alberta people work nonstop , 24 hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can . 
We know about the end of oil . 
Oil sand is not a long - term solution . 
But we use three times more oil than we find every year . 
We do n't want to believe what we know . 
Deny . 
Coral reef in New Caledonia . 
100 percent of the coral may be wiped out before 2050 because of global warming . 
And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature , and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea . 
North Pole . I 've done this picture last summer . 
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago . 
Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific . 
The thickness of the Arctic decreased more than 40 percent since 1960 . 
There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice . 
Sad picture . 
It lost 80 percent of its ice . 
According to scientists , in 100 years all the mountain glacier will be gone . 
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth . 
Like Al Gore told you , two billion people live on the water from the glacier of Himalaya . 
Return of fish men . 
One fifth of human kind depend on fish to live . 
Today now 70 percent of the fish stock are over - exploited . 
According to FAO , if we do n't change our system of fishing the main sea resources will be gone in 2050 . 
We do n't want to believe what we know . 
The beautiful picture , by [ unclear ] in Africa . 
One human of six have not enough to eat in the world . 
One billion people have not enough to eat . 
In Africa , corn is one of the main foods in many places . 
Here in America , 90 percent of the corn cultivated is used to feed animals or to do oil . 
Palm tree plantation in Borneo . 
Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation . 
Refugee camp in Darfur . 
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world . 
According to the U.N. , we speak about 250 million refugees in 2050 . 
I always show my pictures in the street . 
We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities . 
But how to understand the world without the voice of people ? 
Landscape was not enough . 
It was obvious to me to do another work . 
I launched a project named Six Billion Others . 
I sent around the world six cameramen asking the same question , the same crucial question , about life . 
We have done five thousand interviews . 
I 'm going to show you this . 
Man : The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life ? 
It 's when my dad told me , " Here , I give you this girl as your fiance . " 
Woman : Love ? Love is nice if you can have it . 
Second Man : Romeo and Juliet , Sassi and Panno , Dodi and Diana , Heer and Ranjha , this is love ! Third Man : My greatest fear is ... 
Woman : You 're asking me a hard question . 
Fourth Man : I live happily because what else should I do ? 
Fifth Man : The first thing I remember ... 
Fifth Man : ... from my childhood , Fifth Man : we were having fun , biking . 
Seventh Man : We invented stories , we flew around the world , while remaining in our attic . 
Eighth Man : I had a big laugh today . 
Ninth Man : You see , family is ... it 's awful . 
10th Man : In the word life , you have the life . 
11th Man : Who am I ? Is n't that the biggest question ? 
12th Man : If I was to go back to Iraq and speak to the people , I 'd have to bow down and kiss their feet . 
Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet when we were taking her sons . 
I feel ashamed . 
And I feel humbled by their strength . 
And I will forever feel a need to make reparations to Iraq . 
Second Woman : Dad , Mom , I grew up . 
You should n't worry about me . Dad does n't need to go to work . 
My family ... What can I say ? 
At the moment , my family is very poor , my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on . 
I do n't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty . 
If someday I can achieve something , I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy . 
Thank you . 
Thank you for having fed me and raised me , and for making my life of today . Thank you . 
13th Man : After seven years now of being in a wheelchair , I 've done more in life being in a chair than out of a chair . 
I still surf . I sail the world . I freedive . 
After many people said I could n't do that . 
And I think that comes from connecting with nature , connecting with the energy of life , because we 're all disabled in some way on the planet -- spiritually , mentally or physically . 
I got the easy part . 
14th Man : Let 's say that you and me like each other . 
You come from elsewhere . 
You do n't know me . I do n't know you . 
We talk without lying . 
If I do like you , I give you one cow and many other things and we become friends . 
How can we make it all by ourselves ? 
YAB : You can also go to the website , answer -- respond to the questions also . 
Forty crucial questions . 
Now I am going to speak to you about my movie . 
For the last three years , I was shooting the earth for the movie . 
The name of the movie is " Home " -- " Maison . " 
It is about the state of the planet . 
It 's a fantastic story of life on the earth . 
I 'm very proud to show you the teaser . 
Video : This Earth is four and a half billion years old . 
These plants , several hundred million years old . 
And we humans have been walking upright for only 200 thousand years . 
We 've managed to adapt , and have conquered the whole planet . 
For generations , we 've been raising our children , not unlike millions of other species living beside us . 
For the past 30 years I 've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers from high up in the sky . 
Our life is tied to the well - being of our planet . 
We depend on water , forests , deserts , oceans . 
Fishing , breeding , farming are still the world 's foremost human occupations . 
And what binds us together is far greater than what divides us . 
We all share the same need for the earth 's gifts -- the same wish to rise above ourselves , and become better . 
And yet we carry on raising walls to keep us apart . 
Today our greatest battle is to protect the natural offerings of our planet . 
In less than 50 years we 've altered it more thoroughly than in the entire history of mankind . 
Half of the world 's forests have vanished . 
Water resources are running low . 
Intensive farming is depleting soils . 
Our energy sources are not sustainable . 
The climate is changing . 
We are endangering ourselves . 
We 're only trying to improve our lives . 
But the wealth gaps are growing wider . 
We have n't yet understood that we 're going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain . 
We know that solutions are available today . 
We all have the power to change this trend for the better . 
So what are we waiting for ? 
YAB : Luc Besson is the producer of the movie . 
But it is not a normal movie . 
The film is going to be distributed free . 
This film has no copyright . 
On the five of June , the environment day , everybody can download the movie on Internet . 
The film is given for free to the distributor for TV and theater to show it the fifth of June . 
There is no business on this movie . 
It is also available for school , cities , NGOs and you . 
We have to believe what we know . 
Let me tell you something . 
It 's too late to be pessimistic -- really too late . 
We have all a part of the solutions . 
To finish , I would like to welcome the 4,700th baby born since the beginning of this talk . 
Merci beaucoup . I love you .

The Raspyni Brothers juggle and jest 
Dan Holzman : Please throw out the beanbag chairs . Here we go . 
Barry Friedman : There are all kinds of high - tech chairs here today , but this is really , I think , when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics , comfort , design , flexibility ... 
DH : Now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ; it 's something we just kind of learned for this , so we 're going to try . But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs ? 
BF : Nice show , Daniel , nice show . You are the man ! 
Nice show . Man , that was good ! 
DH : Thank you . 
BF : You know , sometimes when people do those , they go all the way down . 
You actually just did that . 
That 's the kind of extra effort that 's gotten us where we are today ... 
DH : All right , let 's show them something special . 
BF : ... without a MacArthur grant . 
Yeah , look at this . You know , all kinds of different ... 
TED is about invention , let 's be honest . Right ? DH : Yeah , it is . 
BF : Last night , Michael Moschen showed some juggling props he has invented and working on . 
Right now , Dan 's going to show something he actually invented . 
DH : A type of juggling I actually invented , right after I saw another juggler do it . 
BF : Shut up . 
DH : And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece . 
Folks , this is shaker cup juggling . It 's not a showstopper but it certainly slows it down . 
BF : Oh yeah , it does . 
BF : Oh , Daniel . 
DH : One more ? 
Perfect . 
Perfect . 
BF : OK . DH : Oh ! All right . 
I 'm now pushing my luck : I 'm skipping right to six cups . 
In order to do six cups , I must have perfect control over three with my right hand . 
BF : Also three with his left . 
DH : Perfect . 
And now , all six cups . Should I do it on the first try or should I miss once on purpose ? 
BF : First try ? Once on purpose ? 
DH : How about if I try first and then decide ? 
BF : Good idea . Let 's leave that . We 'll leave that door open . 
DH : He 's looking at me . 
BF : That 's all right , he does that . All right . 
DH : Oh ! It 's time for Richard 's help . 
Oh , good . All right . 
BF : You know , over the years , every year at the conference , it 's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with Richard . And we 've always done something with the bullwhips in our act . It 's funny , for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons . 
And then we thought , " How stupid . " 
DH : Excuse me , could we work on the design of the microphone ? 
BF : I think that 's the next session . 
DH : Next session ? 
BF : Yeah . And so we 've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this . 
He actually assumes more of the danger in this . 
DH : Please stand up , Richard . 
Oh , sorry . 
DH : Now Richard , please ... 
BF : OK , sorry . 
DH : Jesus Christ . Richard , please stand in front of me . 
Richard Wurman : Can I say something ? 
BF : Sure . 
RW : In all past years I 've rehearsed with them , the things that have happened to me -- I have no idea what 's going to happen and that 's the truth . 
DH : All right , please stand here in front ... 
God , I hate that . Put your hands out like this , please . 
BF : No , come stay up with him . 
Dan used to actually hold them but now he 's got you for protection . 
It 's kind of neat . OK . 
DH : Wow , you 've been working out . 
BF : No , shut up ! 
Having a little bit of Richard time . That 's nice , that 's good . 
OK , here we go . 
Have him hold your wrist so I can ... 
DH : Please hold my wrist , will you . BF : Yeah , hold this a minute . 
There you go . 
OK . 
OK , hold on . 
RW : Hmmm . 
DH : First one . 
BF : All those mid - year phone calls are coming back to me now , Richard . 
DH : So Richard , what were we on the list ? Like 1,020 ? 
What happened there ? 
BF : I think we were just outside . 
DH : I do n't get it . 
DH : Sorry . BF : Having some bad flashbacks . 
RW : Do you want me to hold you or not ? DH : Do n't hold me that hard . 
BF : Here we go , I 'm taking it . 
DH : One more , one more . 
BF : We 've got one more we 're going to do . 
RW : Do I get to hold them ? 
BF : You do n't want to hold these , trust me . 
DH : Could you spread your legs a little bit ? 
BF : Gloria , you want to do it ? It 's very cool . 
One more try . Man , I do n't want to get too close . 
Could you just push that ? 
DH : Wow ! Boy ! 
BF : That 's cool . I always wanted to try that . 
DH : Let 's jump this way , though . 
Now , we risked Richard 's life , it 's only fair we risk our own lives . 
So to do that , I will juggle these three razor - sharp sickles . 
And if that was n't enough , and judging by your response , it 's not ... 
DH : Wow ! BF : Hoping for a little more build . 
DH : True . Barry ... 
BF : I 'm going to run up behind him . 
DH : Leap over my shoulder . 
BF : Up and over his shoulders . 
DH : Grab the blades in mid - air , land right there in a pool of blood ... 
Still juggling . 
Impossible , you say ? 
BF : Incredible , you say ? 
DH : Why bother , you say ? 
BF : Here we go . 
DH : Just do it juggler boys , you say ? 
BF : This guy , this guy invented air . 
DH : I think so , that 's right . 
Even the pencil . 
BF : He invented the pencil . 
DH : All right , we 'll do this trick , but please remember it took us over 10 years to perfect . 
BF : Ten years to perfect , which you 're about to see . 
DH : It 's not that difficult , we just do n't like to practice that much . 
BF : No , it 's a hassle . Traveling too much . 
Actually , we will take a second to prove -- this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor - sharp . 
DH : Will someone please throw a small farm animal up onto the stage ? 
Or a virgin for a sacrifice ? 
BF : Anything ? 
DH : Where 's Gloria ? 
BF : No , she 's got ... farm animal . 
DH : Do you have a small farm animal ? 
Just trying to play the odds . All right , here we go . 
BF : Over the top , over the top . 
DH : How you feeling , Barry ? You feeling all right ? 
BF : Yeah , it 's all right . 
DH : Do you feel everything 's OK ? The atmosphere , the ... 
BF : Yeah , a little sketchy . 
DH : Everything up here 's OK ? 
BF : Yeah . 
DH : Then here we go . 
BF : This one 's a little ... Who 's doing the lights ? Could you point that a little more directly into my eyeballs ? Is that possible ? I can still see a little . 
DH : And turn up the intensity ; we 're still pink in the middle . 
We went too far . 
BF : Yeah , it 's too far . It 's too much of a visual . 
The design of the body is a whole different thing . 
DH : Ready , Barry ? BF : Over the top . 
DH : May we have our jumping music please ? 
May we have it a bit louder ? 
BF : They 're a good crew ! Whoa ! 
DH : Whoa , sorry . All right . 
BF : We 're going on . 
DH : All right , we 'll try again . 
BF : All right ? Oh my gosh . Oh . 
DH : All right , here we go . Sorry about that . 
BF : I thought I had the hard part . OK . 
DH : Whenever you 're ready . 
BF : There we go ! 
All right , get up ! Come on and dance ! DH : Dance , come on . BF : Come on and dance ! 
Somebody dance ! Come on ! 
Wow , wow , OK , stop . 
Weird , no one dances . We 're two guys doing this . 
I think that 's uncomfortable for everyone . 
DH : The French judge ... 
BF : One more quick thing . 
DH : The French judge gives it a 5.2 . 
BF : Well , you know ... 
DH : There you go ... BF : Oh , yeah . Another one coming in . 
DH : Tell them about our bio and stuff . 
BF : Yeah . In our bio , some of you may have read that we 've won two world juggling championships . 
And believe it or not , you do n't win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups . 
We 're going to show you right now an excerpt from a routine that we used to wipe out the other juggling team competition . 
DH : That 's right . 
BF : Good . 
DH : I know what you 're thinking : other juggling teams must really suck . 
BF : Juggling 's got a bad rap . 
DH : But wait , Barry , there 's still one more club lying there by my foot . 
And look , it has a twin ! 
BF : Shut up . 
DH : There 's still one more by my foot . 
What do you want me to do with it ? 
BF : Richard you tell him , it 's your last year . 
DH : That 's a pretty good setup , Richard . 
BF : Yeah , it 's a good setup . That 's a big setup . 
DH : You ca n't get any better than that . All right . What I will do : I will use my panther - like reflexes . 
BF : Nice . 
DH : I got that -- to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel . 
BF : Nice . 
DH : I touched it , Barry . That should be enough . 
BF : It 's progress , that 's the thing . 
DH : How about that ? I 'll do it again . 
Oh wait , it 's on your side , Barry . 
And it 's awfully windy over there . 
BF : It is , it 's weird . You would n't think it would affect half the stage , but it is . It 's weird . 
Watch this : what I 'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot . 
DH : Wow ! What a great trick , Barry ! 
Oh , look how it lies there . 
Oh , Barry , is there nothing you ca n't do ? 
You are my hero . You 're my Jim Shea , Jr. 
Too much Olympics . 
BF : From my foot , I 'll attempt to kick the seventh club . Here we go . 
DH : Where , Barry ? Where ? Tell us , Barry . 
[ Unclear ] eagerly awaits your next syllable . What will it be ? 
What gem of knowledge ? 
What pearl of wisdom ? 
Do you want to buy a vowel , Barry ? 
Is that your final answer ? 
BF : All right ! You have to turn off the TV from time to time . 
DH : I do , I do . 
BF : From my foot , the kick up in the seven . 
DH : We will juggle seven . 
BF : From six to seven . DH : That 's a world 's record . BF : Really ? DH : For us . 
BF : Yes . 
DH : Whenever you 're ready there , big guy . 
Put your tongue away , Barry . 
BF : Oh , oh , whoa . 
DH : Please , please stay seated . Stay seated . Thank you . 
Because now , to make this twice as difficult , we 'll juggle the seven clubs back ... 
BF : Seven - club juggling . 
DH : ... to back . 
BF : Thank you , that 's it . 
BF : Thank you guys ! 
DH : Thank you very much ! 
http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_resnick_welcome_to_the_genomic_revolution.html 
In this accessible talk from TEDxBoston , Richard Resnick shows how cheap and fast genome sequencing is about to turn health care upside down . 
DNA , biotech , health care , science , technology 
1223 
Richard Resnick : Welcome to the genomic revolution 
Ladies and gentlemen , I present to you the human genome . 
Chromosome one , top left . 
Bottom right are the sex chromosomes . 
Women have two copies of that big X chromosome ; men have the X and , of course , that small copy of the Y. 
Sorry boys , but it 's just a tiny little thing that makes you different . 
So if you zoom in on this genome , then what you see , of course , is this double helix structure -- the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters , or we call them bases , right : A , C , G and T. 
How many are there in the human genome ? Three billion . 
Is that a big number ? 
Well , everybody can throw around big numbers . 
But in fact , if I were to place one base on each pixel of this 1280 by 800 resolution screen , we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome . 
So it 's really quite big . 
And perhaps because of its size , a group of people -- all , by the way , with Y chromosomes -- decided they would want to sequence it . 
And so 15 years , actually , and about four billion dollars later , the genome was sequenced and published . 
In 2003 , the final version was published , and they keep working on it . 
That was all done on a machine that looks like this . 
It costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it . 
Well folks , I 'm here to tell you that the world has completely changed and none of you know about it . 
So now what we do is we take a genome , we make maybe 50 copies of it , we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads , and then we sequence them , massively parallel . 
And then we bring that into software , and we reassemble it and we tell you what the story is . 
And so just to give you a picture of what this looks like , the Human Genome Project : 3 gigabases , right . 
One run on one of these machines : 200 gigabases in a week . 
And that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer , and there 's no sign of this pace slowing . 
So the price of a base , to sequence a base , has fallen 100 million times . 
That 's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998 , waiting until 2011 , and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice . 
World population , PC placements , the archive of all the medical literature , Moore 's law , the old way of sequencing , and here 's all the new stuff . 
Guys , this is a log scale ; you do n't typically see lines that go up like that . 
So the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year . 
And we know this based on the machines that are being placed . 
This is expected to double , triple or maybe quadruple year over year for the foreseeable future . 
In fact , there 's one lab in particular that represents 20 percent of all that capacity . 
It 's called the Beijing Genomics Institute . 
The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon , by the way . 
What does this mean for medicine ? 
So a woman is age 37 . 
She presents with stage 2 estrogen receptor - positive breast cancer . 
She is treated with surgery , chemotherapy and radiation . 
She goes home . 
Two years later , she comes back with stage three C ovarian cancer . 
Unfortunately , treated again with surgery and chemotherapy . 
She comes back three years later at age 42 with more ovarian cancer , more chemotherapy . 
Six months later , she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia . 
She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later . 
So first , the way in which this woman was treated , in as little as 10 years , will look like bloodletting . 
And it 's because of people like my colleague , Rick Wilson , at the Genome Institute at Washington University , who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem . 
And he sequenced , he took skin cells , healthy skin , and cancerous bone marrow , and he sequenced the whole genomes of both of them in a couple of weeks , no big deal . 
And then he compared those two genomes in software , and what he found , among other things , was a deletion , a 2,000-base deletion across three billion bases in a particular gene called TP53 . 
If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene , you 're 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life . 
So unfortunately , this does n't help this woman , but it does have severe , profound if you will , implications to her family . 
I mean , if they have the same mutation , and they get this genetic test , and they understand it , then they can go and get regular screens , and they can catch cancer early and potentially live a significantly longer life . 
Let me introduce you now to the Beery twins , diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two . 
Their mom is a very brave woman who did n't believe that the symptoms were n't matching up , and through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching , she was able to convince the medical community that , in fact , they had something else . 
What they had was dopa - responsive dystonia . 
And so they were given L - Dopa , and their symptoms did improve , but they were n't totally asymptomatic . 
Significant problems remained . 
Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery , who was lucky enough to be the CIO of a company called Life Technologies . 
They 're one of the two companies that makes these massive whole genome sequencing tools . 
And so what he did was he got his kids sequenced . 
And what they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR , which is responsible for producing serotonin , among other things . 
So on top of L - Dopa , they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug , and they 're effectively normal now . 
Guys , this would never have happened without whole genome sequencing . 
And at the time -- this was a few years ago -- it cost $ 100,000 . 
Today it 's $ 10,000 . Next year it 's $ 1,000 . 
The year after it 's $ 100 , give or take a year . 
That 's how fast this is moving . 
So here 's little Nick -- likes Batman and squirt guns . 
And it turns out Nick shows up at the children 's hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim . 
And it 's not that he 's not eating , it 's that when he eats , his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut . 
So a hundred surgeries later , he looks at his mom and says , " Mom , please pray for me . I 'm in so much pain . " 
His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what 's going on , but he says , " Let 's get this kid 's genome sequenced . " 
And what they find is a single - point mutation in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death . 
So the theory is that he 's having some immunological reaction to what 's going on to the food essentially , and that 's a natural reaction , which causes some programmed cell death . 
But the gene that regulates that down is broken . 
And so this informs , among other things , of course , a treatment for bone marrow transplant , which he undertakes . 
And after nine months of grueling recovery , he 's now eating steak with A1 sauce . 
The prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today . 
Today , it 's here . 
And what it means for all of us is that everybody in this room could live an extra five , 10 , 20 years just because of this one thing . 
Which is a fantastic story , unless you think about humanity 's footprint on the planet and our ability to keep up food production . 
So it turns out that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines of corn , wheat , soybean and other crops that are highly tolerant of drought , of flood , of pests and pesticides . 
Now look , as long as we continue to increase the population , we 're going to have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods , and that 's the only position that I 'll take today . 
Unless there 's anybody in the audience that would like to volunteer to stop eating ? 
None , not one . 
This is a typewriter , a staple of every desktop for decades . 
And in fact , the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing . 
And then more general versions of word processors came about . 
But ultimately , it was a disruption on top of a disruption . 
It was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet and the connection of all these computers that fundamentally changed everything . 
And suddenly we had Netscape , and we had Yahoo and we had , indeed , the entire dotcom bubble . 
Not to worry though , that was quickly rescued by the iPod , Facebook and , indeed , angry birds . 
Look , this is where we are today . 
This is the genomic revolution today . This is where we are . 
So what I 'd like you to consider is : What does it mean when these dots do n't represent the individual bases of your genome , but they connect to genomes all across the planet ? 
So I just recently had to buy life insurance . 
And I was required to answer : A. I have never had a genetic test , B. I 've had one , here you go , and C. I 've had one and I 'm not telling . 
Thankfully , I was able to answer A , and I say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening . 
But what would have happened if I had said C ? 
Consumer applications for genomics , they will flourish . 
Do you want to see whether you 're genetically compatible with your girlfriend ? Sure . 
DNA sequencing on your iPhone ? There 's an app for that . 
Personalized genomic massage anyone ? 
There 's already a lab today that tests for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene , the so - called cheating gene . 
So anybody who 's here today with your significant other , just turn over to them and swab their mouth , send it to the lab and you 'll know for sure . 
Do you really want to elect a president whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy ? 
Now think of it , it 's 2016 and the leading candidate releases not only her four years of back tax returns , but also her personal genome . 
And it looks really good . 
And then she challenges all of her competitors to do the same . 
Do you think that 's not going to happen ? 
Do you think it would have helped John McCain ? 
How many people in the audience have the last name Resnick like me ? Raise your hand . 
Anybody ? Nobody . 
Typically , there 's one or two . 
So my father 's father was one of 10 Resnick brothers . 
They all hated each other . 
And they all moved to different parts of the planet . 
So it 's likely that I 'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet , but I do n't know . 
But imagine if my genome were deidentified , sitting in software , and a third cousin 's genome was also sitting there , and there was software that could compare these two and make these associations . 
Not hard to imagine . My company has software that does this right now . 
And so imagine one more thing : that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consents , " Would you be willing to meet your third cousin ? " 
And if we both say yes , voila ! Welcome to chromosomally LinkedIn . 
Now this is probably a good thing , right ? 
You have bigger clan gatherings and so on . 
But maybe it 's a bad thing as well . 
How many fathers in the room ? Raise your hands . 
Okay , so experts think that one to three percent of you are not actually the father of your child . 
Look -- These genomes , these 23 chromosomes , they do n't in any way represent the quality of our relationships or the nature of our society -- at least not yet . 
And like any new technology , it 's really in humanity 's hands to wield it for the betterment of mankind , or not . 
And so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in and to influence the genomic revolution that 's happening all around you . 
Thank you .

Daniel Kraft invents a better way to harvest bone marrow 
So I am a pediatric cancer doctor and stem - cell researcher at Stanford University where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation . 
Now , inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year , I did n't bring a human brain , but I did bring a liter of bone marrow . 
And bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients , most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases . 
So , a few years ago , I 'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford . 
I 'm in the operating room . We have Bob here , who is a volunteer donor . 
We 're sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia . 
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow ? 
Well we have a whole O.R. team , general anesthesia , nurses , and another doctor across from me . 
Bob 's on the table , and we take this sort of small needle , you know , not too big . 
And the way we do this is we basically place this through the soft tissue , and kind of punch it into the hard bone , into the tuchus -- that 's a technical term -- and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out , each time , with a syringe . 
And hand it off to the nurse . She squirts it into a tin . 
Hands it back to me . And we do that again and again . 
About 200 times usually . 
And by the end of this my arm is sore , I 've got a callus on my hand , let alone Bob , whose rear end looks something more like this , like Swiss cheese . 
So I 'm thinking , you know , this procedure has n't changed in about 40 years . 
And there is probably a better way to do this . 
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach , and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner . 
This is it . 
And the Marrow Miner , the way it works is shown here . 
Our standard see - through patient . 
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times , we enter just once , into the front of the hip or the back of the hip . 
And we have a flexible , powered catheter with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow and follows the contours of the hip , as it moves around . 
So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate , or suck out , rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole . 
We can do multiple passes through that same entry . 
No robots required . 
And , so , very quickly , Bob can just get one puncture , local anesthesia , and do this harvest as an outpatient . 
So I did a few prototypes . I got a small little grant at Stanford . 
And played around with this a little bit . 
And our team members developed this technology . 
And eventually we got two large animals , and pig studies . 
And we found , to our surprise , that we not only got bone marrow out , but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the Marrow Miner , compared to the normal device . 
This device was just FDA approved in the last year . 
Here is a live patient . You can see it following the flexible curves around . 
There will be two passes here , in the same patient , from the same hole . 
This was done under local anesthesia , as an outpatient . 
And we got , again , about three to six times more stem cells than the standard approach done on the same patient . 
So why should you care ? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells . 
You all know about embryonic stem cells . 
They 've got great potential but have n't yet entered clinical trials . 
Adult stem cells are throughout our body , including the blood - forming stem cells in our bone marrow , which we 've been using as a form of stem - cell therapy for over 40 years . 
In the last decade there 's been an explosion of use of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient 's other diseases such as heart disease , vascular disease , orthopedics , tissue engineering , even in neurology to treat Parkinson 's and diabetes . 
We 've just come out , we 're commercializing , this year , generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner . 
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out , which translates to better outcomes . 
It may encourage more people to sign up to be potential live - saving bone marrow donors . 
It may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells , when you 're younger and healthier , to use in the future should you need it . 
And ultimately -- and here 's a picture of our bone marrow transplant survivors , who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford . 
Hopefully this technology will let us have more of these survivors in the future . 
Thanks . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/garrett_lisi_on_his_theory_of_everything.html 
Physicist and surfer Garrett Lisi presents a controversial new model of the universe that -- just maybe -- answers all the big questions . If nothing else , it 's the most beautiful 8-dimensional model of elementary particles and forces you 've ever seen . 
physics , science , technology 
371 
Garrett Lisi on his theory of everything 
Whoa , dude . Check out those killer equations . Sweet . 
Actually , for the next 18 minutes I 'm going to do the best I can to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations . 
It turns out there 's a lot we can learn from coral . 
Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal . 
Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps . 
These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors . 
If we imagine this to be a hyper - intelligent coral , we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question . 
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location compared to his neighbors -- if it was just chance , or destiny , or what ? 
Now , after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high , he would tell us that our question was completely stupid . 
These corals can be quite kind of mean , you see , and I have surfing scars to prove that . 
But this polyp would continue and tell us that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him . 
That he was in all these other locations as well , but experiencing them as separate individuals . 
For a coral , branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world . 
Unlike us , a hyper - intelligent coral would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics . 
The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works . 
And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities , just like a coral . 
It 's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around , since we only ever get to experience one possibility . 
This quantum weirdness was first described by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat . 
The cat likes this version better . 
In this setup , Schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample that , by the laws of quantum mechanics , branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not . 
In the branch in which the sample radiates , it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schrödinger is dead . 
But in the other branch of reality , he remains alive . 
These realities are experienced separately by each individual . 
As far as either can tell , the other one does n't exist . 
This seems weird to us , because each of us only experiences an individual existence , and we do n't get to see other branches . 
It 's as if each of us , like Schrödinger here , are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities . 
The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us this is how the world works at tiny scales . 
It can be summed up in a single sentence : Everything that can happen , does . 
That 's quantum mechanics . 
But this does not mean everything happens . 
The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what ca n't . 
What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles . 
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced . 
Now I 'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles , what they are and how this balance works . 
In this machine , a beam of protons and anti - protons are accelerated to near the speed of light and brought together in a collision , producing a burst of pure energy . 
This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles , with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties . 
This enormous machine -- the large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva -- has a circumference of 17 miles and , when it 's operating , draws five times as much power as the city of Monterey . 
We ca n't predict specifically what particles will be produced in any individual collision . 
Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized . 
But physics does tell us what particles can be produced . 
These particles must have just as much mass and energy as is carried in by the proton and anti - proton . 
Any particles more massive than this energy limit are n't produced , and remain invisible to us . 
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting . 
It 's going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what 's ever been done before , so we 're going to get to see some new particles very soon . 
But before talking about what we might see , let me describe the particles we already know of . 
There 's a whole zoo of subatomic particles . 
Most of us are familiar with electrons . 
A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around . 
But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino , with no electric charge and a very tiny mass . 
In contrast , the up - and - down quarks have very large masses , and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms . 
All of these matter particles come in left- and right - handed varieties , and have anti - particle partners that carry opposite charges . 
These familiar particles also have less familiar second and third generations , which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses . 
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles . 
The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter via particles called photons . 
There is also a very weak force called , rather unimaginatively , the weak force , that interacts only with left - handed matter . 
The strong force acts between quarks which carry a different kind of charge , called color charge , and come in three different varieties : red , green and blue . 
You can blame Murray Gell - Mann for these names -- they 're his fault . 
Finally , there 's the force of gravity , which interacts with matter via its mass and spin . 
The most important thing to understand here is that there 's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces . 
These four different forces interact with matter according to the corresponding charges that each particle has . 
A particle that has n't been seen yet , but we 're pretty sure exists , is the Higgs particle , which gives masses to all these other particles . 
The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider is to see this Higgs particle , and we 're almost certain it will . 
But the greatest mystery is what else we might see . 
And I 'm going to show you one beautiful possibility towards the end of this talk . 
Now , if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges , there are 226 . 
That 's a lot of particles to keep track of . 
And it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles . 
But if we plot them out according to their charges , some beautiful patterns emerge . 
The most familiar charge is electric charge . 
Electrons have an electric charge , a negative one , and quarks have electric charges in thirds . 
So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton , it has a total electric charge of plus one . 
These particles also have anti - particles , which have opposite charges . 
Now , it turns out the electric charge is actually a combination of two other charges : hypercharge and weak charge . 
If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge and plot the charges of particles in this two - dimensional charge space , the electric charge is where these particles sit along the vertical direction . 
The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter according to their hypercharge and weak charge , which make this pattern . 
This is called the Unified Electroweak Model , and it was put together back in 1967 . 
The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle . 
The Higgs , over here on the left , has a large mass and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern . 
It makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass . 
Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram , the photons of electromagnetism remain massless and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction in this charge space . 
So the electromagnetic and weak forces are described by this pattern of particle charges in two - dimensional space . 
We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks along these directions . 
The charges of all known particles can be plotted in a four - dimensional charge space , and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them . 
Whenever particles interact , nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions . 
If a particle and an anti - particle collide , it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero in all four charge directions . 
At this point , anything can be created as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero . 
For example , this weak force particle and its anti - particle can be created in a collision . 
In further interactions , the charges must always balance . 
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an anti - neutrino , and these three still add to zero total charge . 
Nature always keeps a perfect balance . 
So these patterns of charges are not just pretty . 
They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen . 
And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction , which has this nice hexagonal symmetry . 
In a strong interaction , a strong force particle , such as this one , interacts with a colored quark , such as this green one , to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one . 
And strong interactions are happening millions of times each second in every atom of our bodies , holding the atomic nuclei together . 
But these four charges corresponding to three forces are not the end of the story . 
We can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force . 
When we include these , each matter particle has two different spin charges , spin - up and spin - down . 
So they all split , and give a nice pattern in six - dimensional charge space . 
We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions , and see that it 's quite pretty . 
Right now , this pattern matches our best current knowledge of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles . 
This is what we know for certain . 
Some of these particles are at the very limit of what we 've been able to reach with experiments . 
From this pattern , we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales . The way the universe works with these tiny scales is very beautiful . 
But now I 'm going to discuss some new and old ideas about things we do n't know yet . 
We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone , and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada . 
We want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe . 
And we want to use this picture to predict new particles that we 'll see when experiments reach higher energies . 
So there 's an old idea in particle physics that this known pattern of charges , which is not very symmetric , could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken -- similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern to give electromagnetism . 
In order to do this , we need to introduce new forces with new charge directions . 
When we introduce a new direction , we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction , and then we can rotate it in with the others . 
If we guess wisely , we can construct the standard charges in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions . 
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973 . 
When we look at this new unified pattern , we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing . 
This is the way theories of unification work . 
A physicist looks for larger , more symmetric patterns that include the established pattern as a subset . 
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen . 
This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles , which should act a lot like the weak force , only weaker . 
Now we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles : the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six - dimensional charge space as the first generation . 
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges . 
They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space . 
However , if we work in eight - dimensional charge space , then we can assign unique new charges to each particle . 
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions , and see what the whole pattern looks like . 
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now related to the first generation by a symmetry called " triality . " 
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics . 
It 's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group , E8 . 
This Lie group is a smooth , curved shape with 248 dimensions . 
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry of this very complex and beautiful shape . 
One small part of this E8 shape can be used to describe the curved space - time of Einstein 's general relativity , explaining gravity . 
Together with quantum mechanics , the geometry of this shape could describe everything about how the universe works at the tiniest scales . 
The pattern of this shape living in eight - dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful , and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles , each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape . 
As we spin it , we can see many of the other intricate patterns contained in this one . 
And with a particular rotation , we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis and see all the particles at once . 
It 's a very beautiful object , and as with any unification , we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern . 
There are 20 gaps where new particles should be , two of which have been filled by the Pati - Salam particles . 
From their location in this pattern , we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle , but have color charge and interact with the strong force . 
Filling in these new particles completes this pattern , giving us the full E8 . 
This E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots . 
It 's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics . 
It 's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of particle interactions at the smallest scales imaginable . 
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new . 
In 1623 , Galileo wrote this : " Nature 's grand book , which stands continually open to our gaze , is written in the language of mathematics . 
Its characters are triangles , circles and other geometrical figures , without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it ; without these , one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth . " 
I believe this to be true , and I 've tried to follow Galileo 's guidance in describing the mathematics of particle physics using only triangles , circles and other geometrical figures . 
Of course , when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff , the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth . 
But it 's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics is pure , beautiful geometry . 
Joined with quantum mechanics , this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E8 coral , with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways according to a beautiful pattern . 
And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines like the Large Hadron Collider , we may be able to see whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one . 
This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in . 
If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern , that will be very , very cool . 
If the LHC finds new particles , but they do n't fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this E8 theory . 
And , of course , bad for me personally . 
Now how bad would that be ? 
Well , pretty bad . 
But predicting how nature works is a very risky game . 
This theory and others like it are long shots . 
One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas probably wo n't end up being true about nature . 
That 's what doing theoretical physics is like : there are a lot of wipeouts . 
In this regard , new physics theories are a lot like start - up companies . 
As with any large investment , it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research when it is n't working out . 
But in science , if something is n't working , you have to toss it out and try something else . 
Now , the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life . 
I 've tried the best I can to live a balanced life . 
I try to balance my life equally between physics , love and surfing -- my own three charge directions . 
This way , even if the physics I work on comes to nothing , I still know I 've lived a good life . 
And I try to live in beautiful places . 
For most of the past ten years I 've lived on the island of Maui , a very beautiful place . 
Now it 's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents how I managed to survive all that time without engaging in anything resembling full - time employment . 
I 'm going to let you in on that secret . 
This was a view from my home office on Maui . 
And this is another , and another . 
And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar , but in slightly different places . 
That 's because this used to be my home and office on Maui . 
I 've chosen a very unusual life . 
But not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what I love . 
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times , but it 's allowed me to live in beautiful places and keep a balance in my life that I 've been happy with . 
It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyper - intelligent coral . 
But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyper - intelligent people . 
So I 'm very happy to have been invited here to TED . 
Thank you very much . 
Chris Anderson : I probably understood two percent of that , but I still absolutely loved it . So I 'm going to sound dumb . 
Your theory of everything -- Garrett Lisi : I 'm used to coral . 
CA : That 's right . The reason it 's got a few people at least excited is because , if you 're right , it brings gravity and quantum theory together . 
So are you saying that we should think of the universe , at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are , are somehow an E8 object of possibility ? 
I mean , is there a scale to it , at the smallest scale , or ... ? 
GL : Well , right now the pattern I showed you that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics -- that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape . 
And that 's the one that I said we knew for certain . 
And that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this E8 pattern could be the rest of the picture . 
And these patterns of points that I 've shown for you actually represent symmetries of this high - dimensional object that would be warping and moving and dancing over the space time that we experience . 
And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see . 
CA : But a string theorist , as I understand it , explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating -- I know you do n't like string theory -- vibrating inside it . 
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8 ? 
GL : No , it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape . 
So what 's happening is , as the shape is moving over space - time , it 's twisting . And the direction it 's twisting as it moves is what particle we see . So it would be -- CA : The size of the E8 shape , how does that relate to the electron ? 
I kind of feel like I need that for my picture . 
Is it bigger ? Is it smaller ? 
GL : Well , as far as we know electrons are point particles , so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales . 
So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is , all possibilities are expanding and developing at once . 
And this is why I use the analogy to coral . 
And in this way , the way that E8 comes in is it will be as a shape that 's attached at each point in space - time . 
And , as I said , the way the shape twists -- the directional along which way the shape is twisting as it moves over this curved surface -- is what the elementary particles are , themselves . 
So through quantum field theory , they manifest themselves as points and interact that way . 
I do n't know if I 'll be able to make this any clearer . 
CA : It does n't really matter . 
It 's evoking a kind of sense of wonder , and I certainly want to understand more of this . 
But thank you so much for coming . That was absolutely fascinating .

Good afternoon , good evening , whatever . 
We can go , jambo , guten Abend , bonsoir , but we can also ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh . 
That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening . 
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other , from one group of nests to the next . 
And I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray left off yesterday . 
He was talking about this amazing , three - year - old Australopithecine child , Selam . 
And we 've also been hearing about the history , the family tree , of mankind through DNA genetic profiling . 
And it was a paleontologist , the late Louis Leakey , who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees . 
And it was pretty extraordinary , way back then . 
It 's kind of commonplace now , but his argument was -- because he 'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa . 
And you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils , from the shape of the muscle attachments , something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them . 
But what about how they behaved ? That 's what he wanted to know . 
And of course , behavior does n't fossilize . 
He argued -- and it 's now a fairly common theory -- that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives , the great apes , and humans today , then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape - like , human - like ancestor some seven million years ago . 
And therefore , perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient , ancient past . 
Well , if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution , you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved , based on the behavior of chimpanzees . 
They are more like us than any other living creature , and we 've heard about that during this TED Conference . 
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us , in certain aspects of their behavior . 
Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality . 
Of course , I gave them names . They can live to be 60 years or more , although we think most of them probably do n't make it to 60 in the wild . 
Mr. Wurzel . The female has her first baby when she 's 11 or 12 . 
Thereafter , she has one baby only every five or six years , a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing , sleeping with the mother at night , and riding on her back . 
And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees , just as it is for us , in relation to learning . 
As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals , so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual 's life history . 
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do . 
We know now that they 're capable of imitating behaviors that they see . 
And we believe that it 's in this way that the different tool - using behaviors -- that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa -- how these are passed from one generation to the next , through observation , imitation and practice , so that we can describe these tool - using behaviors as primitive culture . 
Chimpanzees do n't have a spoken language . We 've talked about that . 
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures , many of which are similar , or even identical , to ours and formed in the same context . Greeting chimpanzees embracing . 
They also kiss , hold hands , pat one another on the back . 
And they swagger and they throw rocks . 
In chimpanzee society , we find many , many examples of compassion , precursors to love and true altruism . 
Unfortunately , they , like us , have a dark side to their nature . 
They 're capable of extreme brutality , even a kind of primitive war . 
And these really aggressive behaviors , for the most part , are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group . 
They are very territorially aggressive . 
Chimpanzees , I believe , more than any other living creature , have helped us to understand that , after all , there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom . 
It 's a very blurry line , and it 's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations . 
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day . 
And these chimpanzees , living their complex social lives in the wild , have helped -- more than anything else -- to make us realize we are part of , and not separated from , the amazing animals with whom we share the planet . 
So it 's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habitats . 
This is just one photograph from the air , and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe . 
And it was when I flew over the whole area , about 16 years ago , and realized that outside the park , this forest , which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika , which is where the tiny , 30-square - mile Gombe National Park lies , that a question came to my mind . 
" How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees , when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive ? " 
More people are living there than the land could possibly support . 
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo . 
And very poor people -- they could n't afford to buy food from elsewhere . 
This led to a program , which we call TACARE . 
It 's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park . 
It started small with 12 villages . It 's now in 24 . 
There is n't time to go into it , but it 's including things like tree nurseries , methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded , almost desert - like land up in these mountains . 
Ways of controlling , preventing soil erosion . 
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland , so that within two years they can again be productive . 
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells . 
Perhaps build some schoolrooms . 
Most important of all , I believe , is working with small groups of women , providing them with opportunities for micro - credit loans . 
And we 've got , as is the case around the world , about 95 percent of all loans returned . 
Empowering women , working with education , providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school , in the clear understanding that , all around the world , as women 's education improves , family size drops . 
We provide information about family planning and about HIV / AIDS . 
And as a result of this program , something 's happening for conservation . 
What 's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages , instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys -- and by the way , many of the staff are now Tanzanian -- but when we began the TACARE program , it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages . 
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers , asking what they were interested in . 
Were they interested in conservation ? Absolutely not . 
They were interested in health ; they were interested in education . 
And as time went on , and as their situation began to improve , they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation . 
They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees , so you 've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides . 
Today , we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem . 
This is an area way outside the National Park , stretching out into all these very degraded lands . 
And as these villages have a better standard of life , they are actually agreeing to put between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside , so that once again , as the trees grow back , the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact -- as they must for genetic viability -- with other remnant groups outside the National Park . 
So TACARE is a success . 
We 're replicating it in other parts of Africa , around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure . 
The problems in Africa , however , as we 've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED , are major problems . 
There is a great deal of poverty . 
And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile , particularly when you cut down trees , and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion , as desperate populations cut down more and more trees , so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families , what 's going to happen ? Something 's got to give . 
And the other problems -- in not only Africa , but the rest of the developing world and , indeed , everywhere -- what are we doing to our planet ? 
You know , the famous scientist , E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American , we need three new planets . 
Today , they are saying four . But we do n't have them . We 've got one . 
And what 's happened ? I mean , the question here is , here we are , arguably the most intelligent being that 's ever walked planet Earth , with this extraordinary brain , capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences , and yet we 're destroying the only home we have . 
The indigenous people around the world , before they made a major decision , used to sit around and ask themselves , " How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead ? " 
Today , major decisions -- and I 'm not particularly talking about Africa here , but the developed world -- major decisions involving millions of dollars , and millions of people , are often based on , " How will this affect the next shareholders ' meeting ? " 
And these decisions affect Africa . 
As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests , I realized more and more how so many of Africa 's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation . 
So I began traveling outside Africa , talking in Europe , talking in the United States , going to Asia . 
And everywhere there were these terrible problems . 
And you know the kind I 'm talking about . I 'm talking about pollution . 
The air that we breathe that often poisons us . 
The earth is poisoning our foods . 
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we 're going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural , industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world , seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience . 
The mangroves are being cut down ; the effects of things like the tsunami get worse . 
We 've talked about the soil erosion . 
We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses , so called , leading to climate change . 
Finally , all around the world , people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate . 
All around the world climates are mixed up . 
And it 's the poor people who are affected worse . 
It 's Africa that already is affected . 
In many parts of sub - Saharan Africa , the droughts are so much worse . 
And when the rain does come , it so often leads to flooding and added distress , and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease . 
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land can not support , who are too poor to buy food , who ca n't move away because the whole land is degraded . 
And so you get desertification -- creeping , creeping , creeping -- as the last of the trees are cut down . 
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa . It 's all over the world . 
So it was n't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope . 
We seem to have lost wisdom , the wisdom of the indigenous people . 
I asked a question . " Why ? " 
Well , do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain , the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify , and the human heart ? Talking about it in the non - scientific term , in terms of love and compassion . Is there some disconnect ? 
And these young people , when I talk to them , basically they were either depressed or apathetic , or bitter and angry . And they said more or less the same thing , " We feel this way because we feel you 've compromised our future and there 's nothing we can do about it . " 
We have compromised their future . 
I 've got three little grandchildren , and every time I look at them and I think how we 've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age , I feel this desperation . 
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots , which began right here in Tanzania and has now spread to 97 countries around the world . 
It 's symbolic . Roots make a firm foundation . 
Shoots seem tiny ; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall . 
See the brick wall as all these problems we 've inflicted on the planet , environmental and social . It 's a message of hope . 
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things . 
The most important message of Roots and Shoots : every single one of us makes a difference , every single day . 
We have a choice . Every one of us in this room , we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make . 
The very poor have no choice . It 's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well . 
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects . 
It depends on how old they are , and which country , whether they 're in a city or rural , as to what kinds of projects . 
But basically , we have programs now from preschool right through university , with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups . 
And every group chooses , between them , three different kinds of project to make this a better world , recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other . 
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community . 
And then , if they 're able , they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world . 
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife , domestic animals as well . 
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share . 
And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves , in our families , in our communities , between nations , between cultures , between religions and between us and the natural world . 
We need the natural world . We can not go on destroying it at the rate we are . 
We not do have more than this one planet . 
Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing , one or two projects only -- in Tanzania , in Uganda , Kenya , South Africa , Congo - Brazzaville , Sierra Leone , Cameroon and other groups . And as I say , it 's in 97 countries around the world . 
Of course , they 're planting trees . They 're growing organic vegetables . 
They 're working in the refugee camps , with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money , or just using them to feed their families , and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment , because they 're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens . 
It 's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex - child soldiers . 
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves . 
Once again , they 're useful members of society . 
We have this program in prisons as well . 
So , there 's no time for more Roots and Shoots now . 
But -- oh , they 're also working on HIV / AIDS . 
That 's a very important component of Roots and Shoots , with older kids talking to younger ones . 
And unwanted pregnancies and things like that , which young people listen to better from other youth , rather than adults . 
Hope . That 's the question I get asked as I 'm going around the world : " Jane , you 've seen so many terrible things , you 've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million , at the turn of the century , to no more than 150,000 now , and the same with so many other animals . 
Forests disappearing , deserts where once there was forest . 
Do you really have hope ? " Well , yes . 
You ca n't come to a conference like TED and not have hope , can you ? 
And of course , there 's hope . One is this amazing human brain . 
And I mean , think of the technologies . 
And I 've just been so thrilled , finally , to come to people talking about compost latrines . 
It 's one of my hobbyhorses . 
We just flush all this water down the lavatory , it 's terrible . 
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important . 
Do we care about the planet for our children ? 
How many of us have children or grandchildren , nieces , nephews ? 
Do we care about their future ? 
And if we care about their future , we , as the elite around the world , we can do something about it . We can make choices as to how we live each day . 
What we buy . What we wear . 
And choose to make these choices with the question , how will this affect the environment around me ? 
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up ? 
Or my grandchild , or whatever it is . 
So the human brain , coupled with the human heart , and we join hands around the world . 
And that 's what TED is helping so well with , and Google who help us , and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park . 
All of these technologies we can use . 
Now let 's link them , and it 's beginning to happen , is n't it ? 
You 've heard about it this afternoon . It 's beginning to happen . 
This change , this change . To see change that we must have if we care about the future . 
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient . 
You can take an area that 's absolutely destroyed , with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate . 
And an example is the TACARE program . 
I told you , where a seemingly dead tree stump -- if you stop hacking them for firewood , which you do n't need to because you have wood lots , then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree . 
And animals , almost on the brink of extinction , can be given a second chance . That 's my next book . 
It 's inspiring . And it brings me to my last category of hope , and we 've heard about this so much in the last two days : this indomitable human spirit . This determination of people , the resilience of the human spirit , So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty , or disease , or whatever , can pull themselves up out of it , sometimes with a helping hand , and take their part in society , and take their part in changing the world . 
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring . 
We could make a very long list , but obviously Nelson Mandela , emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor , 23 years of imprisonment , with this amazing ability to forgive , so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath . 
Ken Saro - Wiwa , in Nigeria , who took on the giant oil companies , and although people around the world tried their best , was executed . 
People like this are so inspirational . 
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans . 
And we need some environmental role models as well , and I 've been hearing some of them today . 
So I 'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again , with everyone at TED . 
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things , especially the Roots and Shoots program . 
And just a last word on that -- the young woman who 's running this entire conference center , I met her today . 
She came up so excited , with her certificate . She was [ in ] Roots and Shoots . 
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam . 
She said it 's helped her to do what she 's doing . 
And it was very , very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people , when they are empowered , given the opportunity to take action , to make the world a better place , truly are our hope for tomorrow . 
Thank you .

Dianna Cohen : Tough truths about plastic pollution 
I 'm a visual artist , and I 'm also one of the co - founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition . 
I 've been working with plastic bags , which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork for the last 20 years . 
I turn them into two and three - dimensional pieces and sculptures and installations . 
Upon working with the plastic , after about the first eight years , some of my work started to fissure and break down into smaller little bits of plastic . 
And I thought , " Great . 
It 's ephemeral just like us . " 
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics , I actually realized this was a bad thing . 
It 's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits , because it 's always still plastic . 
And what we 're finding is that a lot of it is in the marine environment . 
I then , in the last few years , learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre . 
And my initial reaction -- and I think this is a lot of people 's first reaction to learning about it -- is , " Oh my God ! 
We 've got to go out there and clean this thing up . " 
So I actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers , a crane , a chipping machine and a cold - molding machine . 
And my intention was to go out to the gyre , raise awareness about this issue and begin to pick up the plastic , chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks that could potentially be used as building materials in underdeveloped communities . 
I began talking with people who actually had been out to the gyre and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment and upon doing so , I realized actually that cleaning it up would be a very small drop in the bucket relative to how much is being generated every day around the world , and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture . 
And the bigger picture is : we need to find a way to turn off the faucet . 
We need to cut the spigot of single - use and disposable plastics , which are entering the marine environment every day on a global scale . 
So in looking at that , I also realized that I was really angry . 
I was n't just concerned about plastic that you 're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean -- of which I have learned there are now 11 gyres , potentially , of plastic in five major oceans in the world . 
It 's not just that gyre of plastic that I 'm concerned about -- it 's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket . 
I 'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic . 
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic , even at the health food market . 
I 'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator , and I 'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic into us and into our bodies . 
So I came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue , and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition . 
We have many initiatives that we 're working on , but some of them are very basic . 
One is : if 80 to 90 percent of what we 're finding in the ocean -- of the marine debris that we 're finding in the ocean -- is plastic , then why do n't we call it what it is . 
It 's plastic pollution . 
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling . 
You put something in a bin and you do n't have to think about it again . 
What is the reality of that ? 
In the United States , less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled . 
And if you really look into it , particularly when it comes to plastic bottles , most of it is only down - cycled , or incinerated , or shipped to China . 
It is down - cycled and turned into lesser things , while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again or can be used again -- a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again . 
So this is a big issue for us . 
Another thing that we 're looking at and asking people to think about is we 've added a fourth R onto the front of the " Reduce , Reuse , Recycle , " three R 's , and that is refuse . 
Whenever possible , refuse single - use and disposable plastics . 
Alternatives exist ; some of them are very old - school . 
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers to store food in . 
And I know that I am doing a service to myself and my family . 
It 's very easy to pick up a stainless - steel bottle or a glass bottle , if you 're traveling and you 've forgotten to bring your stainless - steel bottle and fill that up with water or filtered water , versus purchasing plastic bottled water . 
I guess what I want to say to everybody here -- and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue -- is that this is a huge problem in the oceans , but this is a problem that we 've created as consumers and we can solve . 
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue and teaching people to choose alternatives . 
So whenever possible , to choose alternatives to single - use plastics . 
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so , save our oceans , save our planet , save ourselves . 
Thank you .

This demo -- from Pattie Maes ' lab at MIT , spearheaded by Pranav Mistry -- was the buzz of TED . It 's a wearable device with a projector that paves the way for profound interaction with our environment . Imagine " Minority Report " and then some .

Pattie Maes and Pranav Mistry demo SixthSense 
I 've been intrigued by this question of whether we could evolve or develop a sixth sense -- a sense that would give us seamless access and easy access to meta - information or information that may exist somewhere that may be relevant to help us make the right decision about whatever it is that we 're coming across . 
And some of you may argue , well , do n't today 's cell phones do that already ? 
But I would say no . 
When you meet someone here at TED -- and this is the top networking place , of course , of the year -- you do n't shake somebody 's hand and then say , " Can you hold on for a moment while I take out my phone and Google you ? " 
Or when you go to the supermarket and you 're standing there in that huge aisle of different types of toilet papers , you do n't take out your cell phone , and open a browser , and go to a website to try to decide which of these different toilet papers is the most ecologically responsible purchase to make . 
So we do n't really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take . 
And so my research group at the Media Lab has been developing a series of inventions to give us access to this information in a sort of easy way , without requiring that the user changes any of their behavior . 
And I 'm here to unveil our latest effort , and most successful effort so far , which is still very much a work in process . 
I 'm actually wearing the device right now and we 've sort of cobbled it together with components that are off the shelf -- and that , by the way , only cost 350 dollars at this point in time . 
I 'm wearing a camera , just a simple webcam , a portable , battery - powered projection system with a little mirror . 
These components communicate to my cell phone in my pocket which acts as the communication and computation device . 
And in the video here we see my student Pranav Mistry , who 's really the genius who 's been implementing and designing this whole system . 
And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him . 
The system tracks the four significant fingers . 
In this case , he 's wearing simple marker caps that you may recognize . 
But if you want a more stylish version you could also paint your nails in different colors . 
And the camera basically tracks these four fingers and recognizes any gestures that he 's making so he can just go to , for example , a map of Long Beach , zoom in and out , etc . 
The system also recognizes iconic gestures such as the " take a picture " gesture , and then takes a picture of whatever is in front of you . 
And when he then walks back to the Media Lab , he can just go up to any wall and project all the pictures that he 's taken , sort through them and organize them , and re - size them , etc . , again using all natural gestures . 
So , some of you most likely were here two years ago and saw the demo by Jeff Han or some of you may think , " Well , does n't this look like the Microsoft Surface Table ? " 
And yes , you also interact using natural gestures , both hands , etc . 
But the difference here is that you can use any surface , you can walk to up to any surface , including your hand if nothing else is available and interact with this projected data . 
The device is completely portable , and can be ... 
So one important difference is that it 's totally mobile . 
Another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today 's cell phones and would actually not sort of be a bigger packaging -- could look a lot more stylish than this version that I 'm wearing around my neck . 
But other than letting some of you live out your fantasy of looking as cool as Tom Cruise in " Minority Report , " the reason why we 're really excited about this device is that it really can act as one of these sixth - sense devices that gives you relevant information about whatever is in front of you . 
So we see Pranav here going into the supermarket and he 's shopping for some paper towels . 
And , as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he 's picking up , using either image recognition or marker technology , and give him the green light or an orange light . 
He can ask for additional information . 
So this particular choice here is a particularly good choice , given his personal criteria . 
Some of you may want the toilet paper with the most bleach in it rather than the most ecologically - responsible choice . 
If he picks up a book in the bookstore , he can get an Amazon rating -- it gets projected right on the cover of the book . 
This is Juan 's book , our previous speaker , which gets a great rating , by the way , at Amazon . 
And so , Pranav turns the page of the book and can then see additional information about the book -- reader comments , maybe sort of information by his favorite critic , etc . 
If he turns to a particular page he finds an annotation by maybe an expert of a friend of ours that gives him a little bit of additional information about whatever is on that particular page . 
Reading the newspaper -- it never has to be outdated . 
You can get video annotations of the event that you 're reading about You can get the latest sports scores etc . 
This is a more controversial one . 
As you interact with someone at TED , maybe you can see a word cloud of the tags , the words that are associated with that person in their blog and personal web pages . 
In this case , the student is interested in cameras , etc . 
On your way to the airport , if you pick up your boarding pass , it can tell you that your flight is delayed , that the gate has changed , etc . 
And , if you need to know what the current time is it 's as simple as drawing a watch -- on your arm . 
So that 's where we 're at so far in developing this sixth sense that would give us seamless access to all this relevant information about the things that we may come across . 
My student Pranav , who 's really , like I said , the genius behind this . 
He does deserve a lot of applause because I do n't think he 's slept much in the last three months , actually . 
And his girlfriend is probably not very happy about him either . 
But it 's not perfect yet , it 's very much a work in progress . 
And who knows , maybe in another 10 years we 'll be here with the ultimate sixth sense brain implant . 
Thank you .

Phyllis Rodriguez and Aicha el - Wafi have a powerful friendship born of unthinkable loss . Rodriguez ' son was killed in the World Trade Center attacks on September 11 , 2001 ; el - Wafi 's son Zacarias Moussaoui was convicted of a role in those attacks and is serving a life sentence . In hoping to find peace , these two moms have come to understand and respect one another .

9/11 healing : The mothers who found forgiveness , friendship 
Phyllis Rodriguez : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship . 
And it is . 
And yet , it feels natural to us now . 
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th , 2001 . 
We did n't know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later . 
At the time , we knew that it was political . 
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband , Orlando , and I and our family . 
And when I saw it -- and yet , through the shock , the terrible shock , and the terrible explosion in our lives , literally , we were not vengeful . 
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him , if convicted , my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that , publicly . 
Through that and through human rights groups , we were brought together with several other victims ' families . 
When I saw Aicha in the media , coming over when her son was indicted , and I thought , " What a brave woman . 
Someday I want to meet that woman when I 'm stronger . " 
I was still in deep grief ; I knew I did n't have the strength . 
I knew I would find her someday , or we would find each other . 
Because , when people heard that my son was a victim , I got immediate sympathy . 
But when people learned what her son was accused of , she did n't get that sympathy . 
But her suffering is equal to mine . 
So we met in November 2002 , and Aicha will now tell you how that came about . 
Aicha el - Wafi : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen . 
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui . 
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims . 
So they introduced me to five families . 
And I saw Phyllis , and I watched her . 
She was the only mother in the group . 
The others were brothers , sisters . 
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother , just like me . 
I suffered a lot as a mother . 
I was married when I was 14 . 
I lost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 16 . 
So the story with Zacarias was too much really . 
And I still suffer , because my son is like he 's buried alive . 
I know she really cried for her son . 
But she knows where he is . 
My son , I do n't know where he is . 
I do n't know if he 's alive . I do n't know if he 's tortured . 
I do n't know what happened to him . 
So that 's why I decided to tell my story , so that my suffering is something positive for other women . 
For all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change . 
It 's up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children . 
We must be hand - in - hand and do something together . 
It 's not against women , it 's for us , for us women , for our children . 
I talk against violence , against terrorism . 
I go to schools to talk to young , Muslim girls so they do n't accept to be married against their will very young . 
So if I can save one of the young girls , and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did , well this is something good . 
This is why I 'm here in front of you . 
PR : I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha , starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security , because it was November 2002 , and , frankly , we were afraid of the super - patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members . 
But we were all so nervous . 
" Why does she want to meet us ? " 
And then she was nervous . 
" Why did we want to meet her ? " 
What did we want from each other ? 
Before we knew each others ' names , or anything , we had embraced and wept . 
Then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation . 
And Aicha started , and she said , " I do n't know if my son is guilty or innocent , but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families . 
I know what it is to suffer , and I feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . " 
But she reached out to us in that way , and it was , I 'd like to say , it was an ice - breaker . 
And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connected as human beings . 
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we 'd felt as if we 'd known each other forever . 
Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she 's had . 
I never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a totally different culture and environment from my own . 
And I feel that we have a special connection , which I value very much . 
And I think it 's all about being afraid of the other , but making that step and then realizing , " Hey , this was n't so hard . 
Who else can I meet that I do n't know , or that I 'm so different from ? " 
So , Aicha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ? 
Because our time is up . 
AW : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other . 
You have to be generous , and your hearts must be generous , your mind must be generous . 
You must be tolerant . 
You have to fight against violence . 
And I hope that someday we 'll all live together in peace and respecting each other . 
This is what I wanted to say .

Too much of the world lacks access to clean drinking water . Engineer Michael Pritchard did something about it -- inventing the portable Lifesaver filter , which can make the most revolting water drinkable in seconds . An amazing demo from TEDGlobal 2009 .

Michael Pritchard 's water filter turns filthy water drinkable 
Good morning everybody . 
I 'd like to talk about a couple of things today . 
The first thing is water . 
Now I see you 've all been enjoying the water that 's been provided for you here at the conference , over the past couple of days . 
And I 'm sure you 'll feel that it 's from a safe source . 
But what if it was n't ? 
What if it was from a source like this ? 
Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea . 
I talked a lot in the past about statistics , and the provision of safe drinking water for all . 
But they just do n't seem to get through . 
And I think I 've worked out why . 
It 's because , using current thinking , the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving . 
So we just switch off : us , governments and aid agencies . 
Well , today , I 'd like to show you that through thinking differently , the problem has been solved . 
By the way , since I 've been speaking , another 13,000 people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea . 
And four children have just died . 
I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry . 
I , like most of you , was sitting down , the day after Christmas in 2004 , when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in , playing out on TV . 
The days and weeks that followed , people fleeing to the hills , being forced to drink contaminated water or face death . 
That really stuck with me . 
Then , a few months later , Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America . 
" Okay , " I thought , " here 's a First World country , let 's see what they can do . " 
Day one : nothing . 
Day two : nothing . 
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome ? 
People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water . 
That 's when I decided I had to do something . 
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage , over the next weeks and months , and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife . 
However , after a few failed prototypes , I finally came up with this , the Lifesaver bottle . 
Okay , now for the science bit . 
Before Lifesaver , the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about 200 nanometers . 
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers . 
So a 200-nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole . 
The smallest virus , on the other hand , is about 25 nanometers . 
So that 's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes . 
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers . 
So nothing is getting through . 
Okay , I 'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration . 
Would you like to see that ? 
I spent all the time setting this up , so I guess I should . 
We 're in the fine city of Oxford . 
So -- someone 's done that up . 
Fine city of Oxford , so what I 've done is I 've gone and got some water from the River Cherwell , and the River Thames , that flow through here . And this is the water . 
But I got to thinking , you know , if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh , the water would n't look like this . 
So I 've gone and got some stuff to add into it . 
And this is from my pond . 
Have a smell of that , mister cameraman . 
Okay . Right . 
We 're just going to pour that in there . 
Audience : Ugh ! 
Michael Pritchard : Okay . We 've got some runoff from a sewage plant farm . 
So I 'm just going to put that in there . 
Put that in there . There we go . 
And some other bits and pieces , chuck that in there . 
And I 've got a gift here from a friend of mine 's rabbit . 
So we 're just going to put that in there as well . 
Okay . Now . 
The Lifesaver bottle works really simply . 
You just scoop the water up . 
Today I 'm going to use a jug just to show you all . Let 's get a bit of that poo in there . 
That 's not dirty enough . Let 's just stir that up a little bit . 
Okay , so I 'm going to take this really filthy water , and put it in here . Do you want a drink yet ? 
Okay . There we go . 
Replace the top . 
Give it a few pumps . Okay ? 
That 's all that 's necessary . 
Now as soon as I pop the teat , sterile drinking water is going to come out . 
I 've got to be quick . Okay , ready ? 
There we go . Mind the electrics . 
That is safe , sterile drinking water . 
Cheers . 
There you go Chris . 
What 's it taste of ? 
Chris Anderson : Delicious . 
Michael Pritchard : Okay . 
Let 's see Chris 's program throughout the rest of the show . Okay ? 
Okay . Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world . 
It 'll last for 6,000 liters . 
And when it 's expired , using failsafe technology , the system will shut off , protecting the user . 
Pop the cartridge out . Pop a new one in . 
It 's good for another 6,000 liters . 
So let 's look at the applications . 
Traditionally , in a crisis , what do we do ? 
We ship water . 
Then , after a few weeks , we set up camps . 
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water . 
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp ? 
Diseases spread . More resources are required . 
The problem just becomes self - perpetuating . 
But by thinking differently , and shipping these , people can stay put . 
They can make their own sterile drinking water , and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives . 
Now , it does n't require a natural disaster for this to work . 
Using the old thinking , of national infrastructure and pipe work , is too expensive . 
When you run the numbers on a calculator , you run out of noughts . 
So here is the " thinking different " bit . 
Instead of shipping water , and using man - made processes to do it , let 's use Mother Nature . She 's got a fantastic system . 
She picks the water up from there , desalinates it , for free , transports it over there , and dumps it onto the mountains , rivers , and streams . 
And where do people live ? Near water . 
All we 've go to do is make it sterile . How do we do that ? 
Well , we could use the Lifesaver bottle . 
Or we could use one of these . 
The same technology , in a jerry can . 
This will process 25,000 liters of water ; that 's good enough for a family of four , for three years . 
And how much does it cost ? 
About half a cent a day to run . 
Thank you . 
So , by thinking differently , and processing water at the point of use , mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water . 
They can get it from a source nearby . 
So with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the millennium goal 's target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water . 
To put that into context , The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid . 
But why stop there ? 
With 20 billion dollars , everyone can have access to safe drinking water . 
So the three - and - a - half billion people that suffer every year as a result , and the two million kids that die every year , will live . 
Thank you .

Paddy Ashdown claims that we are living in a moment in history where power is changing in ways it never has before . In a spellbinding talk at TEDxBrussels he outlines the three major global shifts that he sees coming . 
Foreign Policy , global issues , politics , world cultures 
1314 
Paddy Ashdown : The global power shift 
There 's a poem written by a very famous English poet at the end of the 19th century . 
It was said to echo in Churchill 's brain in the 1930s . 
And the poem goes : " On the idle hill of summer , lazy with the flow of streams , hark I hear a distant drummer , drumming like a sound in dreams , far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by , dear to friend and food to powder , soldiers marching , soon to die . " 
Those who are interested in poetry , the poem is " A Shropshire Lad " written by A.E. Housman . 
But what Housman understood , and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too , was that the long , hot , silvan summers of stability of the 19th century were coming to a close , and that we were about to move into one of those terrifying periods of history when power changes . 
And these are always periods , ladies and gentlemen , accompanied by turbulence , and all too often by blood . 
And my message for you is that I believe we are condemned , if you like , to live at just one of those moments in history when the gimbals upon which the established order of power is beginning to change and the new look of the world , the new powers that exist in the world , are beginning to take form . 
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today -- nearly always highly turbulent times , highly difficult times , and all too often very bloody times . 
By the way , it happens about once every century . 
You might argue that the last time it happened -- and that 's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too -- was that when power passed from the old nations , the old powers of Europe , across the Atlantic to the new emerging power of the United States of America -- the beginning of the American century . 
And of course , into the vacuum where the too - old European powers used to be were played the two bloody catastrophes of the last century -- the one in the first part and the one in the second part : the two great World Wars . 
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars , and it 's probably a more accurate way of describing them . 
Well , ladies and gentlemen , we live at one of those times . 
But for us , I want to talk about three factors today . 
And the first of these , the first two of these , is about a shift in power . 
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to , which has never quite happened in the way it 's happening now . 
But let 's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world . 
And what is happening today is , in one sense , frightening because it 's never happened before . 
We have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of Greece passed to Rome and the power shifts that occurred during the European civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different . 
For power is not just moving laterally from nation to nation . 
It 's also moving vertically . 
What 's happening today is that the power that was encased , held to accountability , held to the rule of law , within the institution of the nation state has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage . 
The globalization of power -- we talk about the globalization of markets , but actually it 's the globalization of real power . 
And where , at the nation state level that power is held to accountability subject to the rule of law , on the international stage it is not . 
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides : the power of the Internet , the power of the satellite broadcasters , the power of the money changers -- this vast money - go - round that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary for the trade it 's supposed to be there to finance -- the money changers , if you like , the financial speculators that have brought us all to our knees quite recently , the power of the multinational corporations now developing budgets often bigger than medium - sized countries . 
These live in a global space which is largely unregulated , not subject to the rule of law , and in which people may act free of constraint . 
Now that suits the powerful up to a moment . 
It 's always suitable for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without constraint , but the lesson of history is that , sooner or later , unregulated space -- space not subject to the rule of law -- becomes populated , not just by the things you wanted -- international trade , the Internet , etc . -- but also by the things you do n't want -- international criminality , international terrorism . 
The revelation of 9/11 is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth , nevertheless , those who inhabit that space can attack you even in your most iconic of cities one bright September morning . 
It 's said that something like 60 percent of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11 actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers which 9/11 destroyed . 
You see , our enemies also use this space -- the space of mass travel , the Internet , satellite broadcasters -- to be able to get around their poison , which is about destroying our systems and our ways . 
Sooner or later , sooner or later , the rule of history is that where power goes governance must follow . 
And if it is therefore the case , as I believe it is , that one of the phenomenon of our time is the globalization of power , then it follows that one of the challenges of our time is to bring governance to the global space . 
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent the more or less we are able to achieve that aim : to bring governance to the global space . 
Now notice , I 'm not talking about government . 
I 'm not talking about setting up some global democratic institution . 
My own view , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is unlikely to be done by spawning more U.N. institutions . 
If we did n't have the U.N. , we 'd have to invent it . 
The world needs an international forum . 
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action . 
But when it comes to governance of the global space , my guess is this wo n't happen through the creation of more U.N. institutions . 
It will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty - based systems , treaty - based agreements , to govern that global space . 
And if you look , you can see them happening , already beginning to emerge . 
The World Trade Organization : treaty - based organization , entirely treaty - based , and yet , powerful enough to hold even the most powerful , the United States , to account if necessary . 
Kyoto : the beginnings of struggling to create a treaty - based organization . 
The G20 : we know now that we have to put together an institution which is capable of bringing governance to that financial space for financial speculation . 
And that 's what the G20 is , a treaty - based institution . 
Now there 's a problem there , and we 'll come back to it in a minute , which is that if you bring the most powerful together to make the rules in treaty - based institutions , to fill that governance space , then what happens to the weak who are left out ? 
And that 's a big problem , and we 'll return to it in just a second . 
So there 's my first message , that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently , then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space . 
And watch that beginning to happen . 
My second point is , and I know I do n't have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing , but power is not just shifting vertically , it 's also shifting horizontally . 
You might argue that the story , the history of civilizations , has been civilizations gathered around seas -- with the first ones around the Mediterranean , the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic . 
Well it seems to me that we 're now seeing a fundamental shift of power , broadly speaking , away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [ seaboard ] to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim . 
Now that begins with economic power , but that 's the way it always begins . 
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies , the augmentation of military budgets occurring in the other growing powers in the world . 
I think actually this is not so much a shift from the West to the East ; something different is happening . 
My guess is , for what it 's worth , is that the United States will remain the most powerful nation on earth for the next 10 years , 15 , but the context in which she holds her power has now radically altered ; it has radically changed . 
We are coming out of 50 years , most unusual years , of history in which we have had a totally mono - polar world , in which every compass needle for or against has to be referenced by its position to Washington -- a world bestrode by a single colossus . 
But that 's not a usual case in history . 
In fact , what 's now emerging is the much more normal case of history . 
You 're beginning to see the emergence of a multi - polar world . 
Up until now , the United States has been the dominant feature of our world . 
They will remain the most powerful nation , but they will be the most powerful nation in an increasingly multi - polar world . 
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up -- in China , of course , though my own guess is that China 's ascent to greatness is not smooth . 
It 's going to be quite grumpy as China begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy . 
But that 's a subject of a different discussion . 
You see India , you see Brazil . 
You see increasingly that the world now looks actually , for us Europeans , much more like Europe in the 19th century . 
Europe in the 19th century : a great British foreign secretary , Lord Canning , used to describe it as the " European concert of powers . " 
There was a balance , a five - sided balance . 
Britain always played to the balance . 
If Paris got together with Berlin , Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance . 
Now notice , in a period which is dominated by a mono - polar world , you have fixed alliances -- NATO , the Warsaw Pact . 
A fixed polarity of power means fixed alliances . 
But a multiple polarity of power means shifting and changing alliances . 
And that 's the world we 're coming into , in which we will increasingly see that our alliances are not fixed . 
Canning , the great British foreign secretary once said , " Britain has a common interest , but no common allies . " 
And we will see increasingly that even we in the West will reach out , have to reach out , beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers to make alliances with others if we want to get things done in the world . 
Note , that when we went into Libya , it was not good enough for the West to do it alone ; we had to bring others in . 
We had to bring , in this case , the Arab League in . 
My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times when the West has tried to do it themselves , and we have n't succeeded . 
My guess is that we 're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years -- I say 400 years because it 's the end of the Ottoman Empire -- of the hegemony of Western power , Western institutions and Western values . 
You know , up until now , if the West got its act together , it could propose and dispose in every corner of the world . 
But that 's no longer true . 
Take the last financial crisis after the Second World War . 
The West got together -- the Bretton Woods Institution , World Bank , International Monetary Fund -- the problem solved . 
Now we have to call in others . 
Now we have to create the G20 . 
Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle of our Western friends . 
Let me make a prediction for you , which is probably even more startling . 
I suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when Western power was enough . 
People say to me , " The Chinese , of course , they 'll never get themselves involved in peace - making , multilateral peace - making around the world . " 
Oh yes ? Why not ? 
How many Chinese troops are serving under the blue beret , serving under the blue flag , serving under the U.N. command in the world today ? 
3,700 . 
How many Americans ? 11 . 
What is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of Somali pirates ? 
The Chinese naval contingent . 
Of course they are , they are a mercantilist nation . 
They want to keep the sea lanes open . 
Increasingly , we are going to have to do business with people with whom we do not share values , but with whom , for the moment , we share common interests . 
It 's a whole new different way of looking at the world that is now emerging . 
And here 's the third factor , which is totally different . 
Today in our modern world , because of the Internet , because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here , everything is connected to everything . 
We are now interdependent . 
We are now interlocked , as nations , as individuals , in a way which has never been the case before , never been the case before . 
The interrelationship of nations , well it 's always existed . 
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations . 
But now we are intimately locked together . 
You get swine flu in Mexico , it 's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport 24 hours later . 
Lehman Brothers goes down , the whole lot collapses . 
There are fires in the steppes of Russia , food riots in Africa . 
We are all now deeply , deeply , deeply interconnected . 
And what that means is the idea of a nation state acting alone , not connected with others , not working with others , is no longer a viable proposition . 
Because the actions of a nation state are neither confined to itself , nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself to control its own territory , because the effects outside the nation state are now beginning to affect what happens inside them . 
I was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of Britain . 
At that time , the defense of my country was about one thing and one thing only : how strong was our army , how strong was our air force , how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies . 
That was when the enemy was outside the walls . 
Now the enemy is inside the walls . 
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country , I have to speak to the Minister of Health because pandemic disease is a threat to my security , I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture because food security is a threat to my security , I have to speak to the Minister of Industry because the fragility of our hi - tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our enemies -- as we see from cyber warfare -- I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs because who has entered my country , who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings . 
It 's no longer the case that the security of a country is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense . 
It 's its capacity to lock together its institutions . 
And this tells you something very important . 
It tells you that , in fact , our governments , vertically constructed , constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution -- vertical hierarchy , specialization of tasks , command structures -- have got the wrong structures completely . 
You in business know that the paradigm structure of our time , ladies and gentlemen , is the network . 
It 's your capacity to network that matters , both within your governments and externally . 
So here is Ashdown 's third law . 
By the way , do n't ask me about Ashdown 's first law and second law because I have n't invented those yet ; it always sounds better if there 's a third law , does n't it ? 
Ashdown 's third law is that in the modern age , where everything is connected to everything , the most important thing about what you can do is what you can do with others . 
The most important bit about your structure -- whether you 're a government , whether you 're an army regiment , whether you 're a business -- is your docking points , your interconnectors , your capacity to network with others . 
You understand that in industry ; governments do n't . 
But now one final thing . 
If it is the case , ladies and gentlemen -- and it is -- that we are now locked together in a way that has never been quite the same before , then it 's also the case that we share a destiny with each other . 
Suddenly and for the very first time , collective defense , the thing that has dominated us as the concept of securing our nations , is no longer enough . 
It used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe , I was safe ; if my country was more powerful than their country , I was safe ; my alliance , like NATO , was more powerful than their alliance , I was safe . 
It is no longer the case . 
The advent of the interconnectedness and of the weapons of mass destruction means that , increasingly , I share a destiny with my enemy . 
When I was a diplomat negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union in Geneva in the 1970s , we succeeded because we understood we shared a destiny with them . 
Collective security is not enough . 
Peace has come to Northern Ireland because both sides realized that the zero - sum game could n't work . 
They shared a destiny with their enemies . 
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East is that both sides , both Israel and , I think , the Palestinians , do not understand that they share a collective destiny . 
And so suddenly , ladies and gentlemen , what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy . 
I started with a poem , I 'll end with one . 
The great poem of John Donne 's . 
" Send not for whom the bell tolls . " 
The poem is called " No Man is an Island . " 
And it goes : " Every man 's death affected me , for I am involved in mankind , send not to ask for whom the bell tolls , it tolls for thee . " 
For John Donne , a recommendation of morality . 
For us , I think , part of the equation for our survival . 
Thank you very much .

To find the path to long life and health , Dan Buettner and team study the world 's " Blue Zones , " communities whose elders live with vim and vigor to record - setting age . At TEDxTC , he shares the 9 common diet and lifestyle habits that keep them spry past age 100 .

Dan Buettner : How to live to be 100 + 
Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives , within certain biological limits , is dictated by our genes . 
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle . 
So the premise of Blue Zones : if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity . 
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is , they probably could n't tell you . 
They 've probably heard of the South Beach Diet , or the Atkins Diet . 
You have the USDA food pyramid . 
There is what Oprah tells us . 
There is what Doctor Oz tells us . 
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better . 
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga ? 
Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu ? 
When it comes to supplements , should you be taking them ? 
How about these hormones or resveratrol ? 
And does purpose play into it ? 
Spirituality ? And how about how we socialize ? 
Well , our approach to finding longevity was to team up with National Geographic , and the National Institute on Aging , to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined . 
And then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do , to distill down the cross - cultural distillation . 
And at the end of this I 'm going to tell you what that distillation is . 
But first I 'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity . 
And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be 100 . 
False . 
The problem is , only about one out of 5,000 people in America live to be 100 . 
Your chances are very low . 
Even though it 's the fastest growing demographic in America , it 's hard to reach 100 . 
The problem is that we 're not programmed for longevity . 
We are programmed for something called procreative success . 
I love that word . 
It reminds me of my college days . 
Biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation , the age when your children have children . 
After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates . 
If you 're a mammal , if you 're a rat or an elephant , or a human , in between , it 's the same story . 
So to make it to age 100 , you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle , you also have to have won the genetic lottery . 
The second myth is , there are treatments that can help slow , reverse , or even stop aging . 
False . 
When you think of it , there is 99 things that can age us . 
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back . 
Play tennis too hard , on your knees , ruin your cartilage , the cartilage never comes back . 
Our arteries can clog . Our brains can gunk up with plaque , and we can get Alzheimer 's . 
There is just too many things to go wrong . 
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells , trillion with a " T. " We 're talking national debt numbers here . 
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years . 
And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage . And that damage builds up . 
And it builds up exponentially . 
It 's a little bit like the days when we all had Beatles albums or Eagles albums and we 'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape , and let our friends copy that cassette tape , and pretty soon , with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage . 
Well , the same things happen to our cells . 
That 's why a 65-year - old person is aging at a rate of about 125 times faster than a 12-year - old person . 
So , if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging , what am I doing here ? 
Well , the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body , my body , your body , is about 90 years , a little bit more for women . 
But life expectancy in this country is only 78 . 
So somewhere along the line , we 're leaving about 12 good years on the table . 
These are years that we could get . 
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes . 
We think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them , areas where people are living to age 100 at rates up to 10 times greater than we are , areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years , the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country . 
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles off the coast of Italy , on the island of Sardinia . 
And not the entire island , the island is about 1.4 million people , but only up in the highlands , an area called the Nuoro province . 
And here we have this area where men live the longest , about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America . 
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100 , they do so with extraordinary vigor . 
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work , chop wood , and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them . 
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ . 
It 's actually a Bronze Age culture that 's been isolated . 
Because the land is so infertile , they largely are shepherds , which occasions regular , low - intensity physical activity . 
Their diet is mostly plant - based , accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields . 
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat , a type of cheese made from grass - fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn - fed animals , and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world . 
It 's called Cannonau . 
But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society . 
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people . 
You ever notice here in America , social equity seems to peak at about age 24 ? 
Just look at the advertisements . 
Here in Sardinia , the older you get the more equity you have , the more wisdom you 're celebrated for . 
You go into the bars in Sardinia , instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar , you see the centenarian of the month calendar . 
This , as it turns out , is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family -- it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy -- research shows it 's also good for the children of those families , who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease . 
That 's called the grandmother effect . 
We found our second Blue Zone on the other side of the planet , about 800 miles south of Tokyo , on the archipelago of Okinawa . 
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands . 
And in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity . 
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found . 
It 's a place where people have the longest disability - free life expectancy in the world . 
They have what we want . 
They live a long time , and tend to die in their sleep , very quickly , and often , I can tell you , after sex . 
They live about seven good years longer than the average American . 
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America . 
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer , big killers here in America . 
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease . 
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us . 
What do they do ? 
Once again , a plant - based diet , full of vegetables with lots of color in them . 
And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do . 
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it . 
They have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating , which , as you know , is a big problem here in America . 
A few of the strategies we observed : they eat off of smaller plates , so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting . 
Instead of serving family style , where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you 're talking , they serve at the counter , put the food away , and then bring it to the table . 
They also have a 3,000-year - old adage , which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented . 
It was invented by Confucius . 
And that diet is known as the Hara , Hatchi , Bu diet . 
It 's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [ 80 ] percent full . 
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain . 
And by remembering to stop at 80 percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing . 
But , like Sardinia , Okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity . 
We know that isolation kills . 
Fifteen years ago , the average American had three good friends . 
We 're down to one and half right now . 
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa , you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life . 
They call it a Moai . And if you 're in a Moai you 're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck , and if things go bad , child gets sick , parent dies , you always have somebody who has your back . 
This particular Moai , these five ladies have been together for 97 years . 
Their average age is 102 . 
Typically in America we 've divided our adult life up into two sections . 
There is our work life , where we 're productive . 
And then one day , boom , we retire . 
And typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair , or going down to Arizona to play golf . 
In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement . 
Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life , and that word is " ikigai . " 
And , roughly translated , it means " the reason for which you wake up in the morning . " 
For this 102-year - old karate master , his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art . 
For this hundred - year - old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week . 
And this is a question . The National Institute on Aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians . 
And one of the questions , they were very culturally astute , the people who put the questionnaire . 
One of the questions was , " What is your ikigai ? " 
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning . 
For this 102 year old woman , her ikigai was simply her great - great - great - granddaughter . 
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years . 
And I asked her what it felt like to hold a great - great - great - granddaughter . 
And she put her head back and she said , " It feels like leaping into heaven . " 
I thought that was a wonderful thought . 
My editor at Geographic wanted me to find America 's Blue Zone . 
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota , where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians . 
But that 's because all the young people left . 
So , we turned to the data again . 
And we found America 's longest - lived population among the Seventh - Day Adventists concentrated in and around Loma Linda , California . 
Adventists are conservative Methodists . 
They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday . 
A " 24-hour sanctuary in time , " they call it . 
And they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity , comparatively speaking . 
In America here , life expectancy for the average woman is 80 . 
But for an Adventist woman , their life expectancy is 89 . 
And the difference is even more pronounced among men , who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their American counterparts . 
Now , this is a study that followed about 70,000 people for 30 years . 
Sterling study . And I think it supremely illustrates the premise of this Blue Zone project . 
This is a heterogeneous community . 
It 's white , black , Hispanic , Asian . 
The only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives . 
They take their diet directly from the Bible . 
Genesis : Chapter one , Verse [ 29 ] , where God talks about legumes and seeds , and on one more stanza about green plants , ostensibly missing is meat . 
They take this sanctuary in time very serious . 
For 24 hours every week , no matter how busy they are , how stressed out they are at work , where the kids need to be driven , they stop everything and they focus on their God , their social network , and then , hardwired right in the religion , are nature walks . 
And the power of this is not that it 's done occasionally , the power is it 's done every week for a lifetime . 
None of it 's hard . None of it costs money . 
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists . 
So , if you go to an Adventist 's party you do n't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint . 
Instead they 're talking about their next nature walk , exchanging recipes , and yes , they pray . 
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways . 
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham . 
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old . 
He 's a multimillionaire , yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars to build a privacy fence , he said , " For that kind of money I 'll do it myself . " 
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement , and hauling poles around . 
And predictably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room . 
But not as the guy on the table ; the guy doing open - heart surgery . 
At 97 he still does 20 open - heart surgeries every month . 
Ed Rawlings , 103 years old now , an active cowboy , starts his morning with a swim . 
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards , throw up rooster tails . 
And then Marge Deton . 
Marge is 104 . 
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here . 
She starts her day with lifting weights . 
She rides her bicycle . 
And then she gets in her root - beer colored 1994 Cadillac Seville , and tears down the San Bernardino freeway , where she still volunteers for seven different organizations . 
I 've been on 19 hardcore expeditions . 
I 'm probably the only person you 'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the Sahara desert without sunscreen . 
But I 'll tell you , there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with Marge Deton . 
" A stranger is a friend I have n't met yet ! " she 'd say to me . 
So , what are the common denominators in these three cultures ? 
What are the things that they all do ? 
And we managed to boil it down to nine . 
In fact we 've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true . 
And the first one , and I 'm about to utter a heresy here , none of them exercise , at least the way we think of exercise . 
Instead , they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity . 
These 100-year - old Okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground , they sit on the floor , 30 or 40 times a day . 
Sardinians live in vertical houses , up and down the stairs . 
Every trip to the store , or to church or to a friend 's house occasions a walk . 
They do n't have any conveniences . 
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work . 
If they want to mix up a cake , they 're doing it by hand . 
That 's physical activity . 
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does . 
When they do do intentional physical activity , it 's the things they enjoy . They tend to walk , the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline , and they all tend to have a garden . 
They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook . 
Each of these cultures take time to downshift . 
The Sardinians pray . The Seventh - Day Adventists pray . 
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration . 
But when you 're in a hurry or stressed out , that triggers something called the inflammatory response , which is associated with everything from Alzheimer 's disease to cardiovascular disease . 
When you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti - inflammatory state . 
They have vocabulary for sense of purpose , ikigai , like the Okinawans . 
You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you 're born , because of infant mortality , and the year you retire . 
These people know their sense of purpose , and they activate in their life , that 's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy . 
There 's no longevity diet . 
Instead , these people drink a little bit every day , not a hard sell to the American population . 
They tend to eat a plant - based diet . 
Does n't mean they do n't eat meat , but lots of beans and nuts . 
And they have strategies to keep from overeating , little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time . 
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect . 
They put their families first , take care of their children and their aging parents . 
They all tend to belong to a faith - based community , which is worth between four and 14 extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month . 
And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe . 
They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people . 
We know from the Framingham studies , that if your three best friends are obese there is a 50 percent better chance that you 'll be overweight . 
So , if you hang out with unhealthy people , that 's going to have a measurable impact over time . 
Instead , if your friend 's idea of recreation is physical activity , bowling , or playing hockey , biking or gardening , if your friends drink a little , but not too much , and they eat right , and they 're engaged , and they 're trusting and trustworthy , that is going to have the biggest impact over time . 
Diets do n't work . No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population . 
Exercise programs usually start in January ; they 're usually done by October . 
When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else . 
But when you think about it , your friends are long - term adventures , and therefore , perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life , and life to your years . Thank you very much .

Ink that conducts electricity ; a window that turns from clear to opaque at the flip of a switch ; a jelly that makes music . All this stuff exists , and Catarina Mota says : It 's time to play with it . Mota leads us on a tour of surprising and cool new materials , and suggests that the way we 'll figure out what they 're good for is to experiment , tinker and have fun .

Catarina Mota : Play with smart materials 
I have a friend in Portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a washing machine so he could transport his family . 
He did it because he could n't afford a car , but also because he knew how to build one . 
There was a time when we understood how things worked and how they were made , so we could build and repair them , or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy . 
Many of these do - it - yourself practices were lost in the second half of the 20th century . 
But now , the maker community and the open - source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what they 're made of back into our lives , and I believe we need to take them to the next level , to the components things are made of . 
For the most part , we still know what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced . 
But now we have these amazing , futuristic composites -- plastics that change shape , paints that conduct electricity , pigments that change color , fabrics that light up . 
Let me show you some examples . 
So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires . 
In the case of this little example I 'm holding , we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this little light . 
Conductive ink has been used by artists , but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens . 
And this is a sheet of acrylic infused with colorless light - diffusing particles . 
What this means is that , while regular acrylic only diffuses light around the edges , this one illuminates across the entire surface when I turn on the lights around it . 
Two of the known applications for this material include interior design and multi - touch systems . 
And thermochromic pigments change color at a given temperature . 
So I 'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what happens . 
So one of the principle applications for this material is , amongst other things , in baby bottles , so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink . 
So these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials . 
In a few years , they will be in many of the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis . 
We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us , but we can have walls that change color depending on temperature , keyboards that roll up , and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch . 
So I 'm a social scientist by training , so why am I here today talking about smart materials ? 
Well first of all , because I am a maker . 
I 'm curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we do n't know enough about these high - tech composites our future will be made of . 
Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities . 
There 's barely any information available on how to use them , and very little is said about how they are produced . 
So for now , they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to . 
So a little over three years ago , Kirsty Boyle and I started a project we called Open Materials . 
It 's a website where we , and anyone else who wants to join us , share experiments , publish information , encourage others to contribute whenever they can , and aggregate resources such as research papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves . 
We would like it to become a large , collectively generated database of do - it - yourself information on smart materials . 
But why should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of ? 
First of all , because we ca n't shape what we do n't understand , and what we do n't understand and use ends up shaping us . 
The objects we use , the clothes we wear , the houses we live in , all have a profound impact on our behavior , health and quality of life . 
So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials , we should know and understand them . 
Secondly , and just as important , innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers . 
So many times , amateurs , not experts , have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors , personal computers , airplanes . 
The biggest challenge is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment . 
But that 's not always the case . 
Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this when they published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink . 
Jordan Bunker , who had had no experience with chemistry until then , read this paper and reproduced the experiment at his maker space using only off - the - shelf substances and tools . 
He used a toaster oven , and he even made his own vortex mixer , based on a tutorial by another scientist / maker . 
Jordan then published his results online , including all the things he had tried and did n't work , so others could study and reproduce it . 
So Jordan 's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well - equipped lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in Chicago using only cheap materials and tools he made himself . 
And now that he published this work , others can pick up where he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements . 
Another example I 'd like to mention Her project 's goal is to highlight the expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder . 
Electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn . 
So Hannah 's approach , on the other hand , is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that free us from pre - designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves . 
So amongst Hannah 's many impressive experiments , this is one of my favorites . 
[ " Paper speakers " ] What we 're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player and a magnet . 
So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT , Hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink . 
Just like Jordan and so many other makers , Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them . 
But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics . 
So Hannah 's artisanal work , and the fact that she shared her findings , opens the doors to a series of new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative . 
So the interesting thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity , and we are not afraid to fail . 
We often tackle problems from unconventional angles , and , in the process , end up discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things . 
So the more people experiment with materials , the more researchers are willing to share their research , and manufacturers their knowledge , the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all . 
So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have when , in the early 1970s , he wrote , " You must understand computers now . " 
Back then , computers were these large mainframes only scientists cared about , and no one dreamed of even having one at home . 
So it 's a little strange that I 'm standing here and saying , " You must understand smart materials now . " 
Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our future . 
Thank you . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_healey_if_cars_could_talk_accidents_might_be_avoidable.html 
When we drive , we get into a glass bubble , lock the doors and press the accelerator , relying on our eyes to guide us -- even though we can only see the few cars ahead of and behind us . But what if cars could share data with each other about their position and velocity , and use predictive models to calculate the safest routes for everyone on the road ? Jennifer Healey imagines a world without accidents . 
cars , technology 
1724 
Jennifer Healey : If cars could talk , accidents might be avoidable 
Let 's face it : Driving is dangerous . 
It 's one of the things that we do n't like to think about , but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true . 
Car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages 16 to 19 in the United States -- leading cause of death -- and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol . 
So what happens ? 
No one can say for sure , but I remember my first accident . 
I was a young driver out on the highway , and the car in front of me , I saw the brake lights go on . 
I 'm like , " Okay , all right , this guy is slowing down , I 'll slow down too . " 
I step on the brake . 
But no , this guy is n't slowing down . 
This guy is stopping , dead stop , dead stop on the highway . 
It was just going 65 -- to zero ? 
I slammed on the brakes . 
I felt the ABS kick in , and the car is still going , and it 's not going to stop , and I know it 's not going to stop , and the air bag deploys , the car is totaled , and fortunately , no one was hurt . 
But I had no idea that car was stopping , and I think we can do a lot better than that . 
I think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other . 
I just want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now . 
Get into your car . Close the door . You 're in a glass bubble . 
You ca n't really directly sense the world around you . 
You 're in this extended body . 
You 're tasked with navigating it down partially - seen roadways , in and amongst other metal giants , at super - human speeds . 
Okay ? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes . 
Okay , so that 's all you have , eyes that were n't really designed for this task , but then people ask you to do things like , you want to make a lane change , what 's the first thing they ask you do ? 
Take your eyes off the road . That 's right . 
Stop looking where you 're going , turn , check your blind spot , and drive down the road without looking where you 're going . 
You and everyone else . This is the safe way to drive . 
Why do we do this ? Because we have to , we have to make a choice , do I look here or do I look here ? 
What 's more important ? 
And usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road . 
But occasionally we miss something . 
Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late . 
In countless accidents , the driver says , " I did n't see it coming . " 
And I believe that . I believe that . 
We can only watch so much . 
But the technology exists now that can help us improve that . 
In the future , with cars exchanging data with each other , we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind , to the right and left , all at the same time , bird 's eye view , we will actually be able to see into those cars . 
We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us , to see how fast that guy 's going or stopping . 
If that guy 's going down to zero , I 'll know . 
And with computation and algorithms and predictive models , we will be able to see the future . 
You may think that 's impossible . 
How can you predict the future ? That 's really hard . 
Actually , no . With cars , it 's not impossible . 
Cars are three - dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity . 
They travel down roads . 
Often they travel on pre - published routes . 
It 's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car 's going to be in the near future . 
Even if , when you 're in your car and some motorcyclist comes -- bshoom ! -- 85 miles an hour down , lane - splitting -- I know you 've had this experience -- that guy did n't " just come out of nowhere . " 
That guy 's been on the road probably for the last half hour . 
Right ? I mean , somebody 's seen him . 
Ten , 20 , 30 miles back , someone 's seen that guy , and as soon as one car sees that guy and puts him on the map , he 's on the map -- position , velocity , good estimate he 'll continue going 85 miles an hour . 
You 'll know , because your car will know , because that other car will have whispered something in his ear , like , " By the way , five minutes , motorcyclist , watch out . " 
You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave . 
I mean , they 're Newtonian objects . 
That 's very nice about them . 
So how do we get there ? 
We can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars , just sharing GPS . 
If I have a GPS and a camera in my car , I have a pretty precise idea of where I am and how fast I 'm going . 
With computer vision , I can estimate where the cars around me are , sort of , and where they 're going . 
And same with the other cars . 
They can have a precise idea of where they are , and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are . 
What happens if two cars share that data , if they talk to each other ? 
I can tell you exactly what happens . 
Both models improve . 
Everybody wins . 
Professor Bob Wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens when fuzzy estimates combine , even in light traffic , when cars just share GPS data , and we 've moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now on these robots : stereo cameras , GPS , and the two - dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems . 
We also attach a discrete short - range communication radio , and the robots talk to each other . 
When these robots come at each other , they track each other 's position precisely , and they can avoid each other . 
We 're now adding more and more robots into the mix , and we encountered some problems . 
One of the problems , when you get too much chatter , it 's hard to process all the packets , so you have to prioritize , and that 's where the predictive model helps you . 
If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories , you do n't pay as much attention to those packets . 
You prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course . 
That guy could be a problem . 
And you can predict the new trajectory . 
So you do n't only know that he 's going off course , you know how . 
And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way . 
And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone ? 
How can these cars whisper , " You need to get out of the way ? " 
Well , it depends on two things : one , the ability of the car , and second the ability of the driver . 
If one guy has a really great car , but they 're on their phone or , you know , doing something , they 're not probably in the best position to react in an emergency . 
So we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling . 
And now , using a series of three cameras , we can detect if a driver is looking forward , looking away , looking down , on the phone , or having a cup of coffee . 
We can predict the accident and we can predict who , which cars , are in the best position to move out of the way to calculate the safest route for everyone . 
Fundamentally , these technologies exist today . 
I think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data . 
I think it 's a very disconcerting notion , this idea that our cars will be watching us , talking about us to other cars , that we 'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip . 
But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy , just like right now , when I look at your car from the outside , I do n't really know about you . 
If I look at your license plate number , I do n't really know who you are . 
I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs . 
And I think it 's going to be a great thing . 
I want you to consider for a moment if you really do n't want the distracted teenager behind you to know that you 're braking , that you 're coming to a dead stop . 
By sharing our data willingly , we can do what 's best for everyone . 
So let your car gossip about you . 
It 's going to make the roads a lot safer . 
Thank you .

X Prize founder Peter Diamandis talks about how he helped Stephen Hawking fulfill his dream of going to space -- by flying together into the upper atmosphere and experiencing weightlessness at zero g.

Peter Diamandis on Stephen Hawking in zero g 
Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier . 
So when I had the chance to give the world 's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity , it was incredible . 
And I want to tell you that story . 
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics . 
It 's a competition we 're holding , the second X PRIZE , for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days . 
We have something called the Genome 100 -- 100 individuals we 're sequencing as part of that . 
Craig Venter chairs that event . 
And I met Professor Hawking , and he said his dream was to travel into space . 
And I said , " I ca n't take you there , but I can take you into weightlessness into zero - g . 
And he said , on the spot , " Absolutely , yes . " 
Well , the only way to experience zero - g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight , weightless flight . 
You take an airplane , you fly over the top , you 're weightless for 25 seconds . 
Come back down , you weigh twice as much . 
You do it again and again . 
You can get eight , 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA 's trained their astronauts for so long . 
We set out to do this . 
It took us 11 years to become operational . 
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking . 
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say , you 're crazy , do n't do that , you 're going kill the guy . 
And he wanted to go . 
We worked hard to get all the permissions . 
And six months later , we sat down at Kennedy Space Center . 
We had a press conference , we announced our intent to do one zero - g parabola , give him 25 seconds of zero - g . 
And if it went really well , we might do three parabolas . 
Well , we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this . 
And what he said , for me , was very moving . 
He said , " Life on Earth is at an ever - increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ... 
I think the human race does n't have a future if it does n't go into space . 
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space . " 
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center , up inside the NASA vehicle , into the back of the zero - g airplane . 
We had about 20 people who made donations -- we raised $ 150,000 in donations for children 's charities -- who flew with us . 
A few TEDsters here . 
We set up a whole ER . 
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane . 
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood , his heart rate , his blood pressure . 
We had everything all set in case of an emergency ; God knows , you do n't want to hurt this world - renowned expert . 
We took off from the shuttle landing facility , where the shuttle takes off and lands . 
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero - g . 
Once he was there , [ we ] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like . 
And after that first parabola , you know , the doc said everything is great . He was smiling , and we said go . 
So we did a second parabola . 
And a third . 
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did . 
And we did a fourth , and a fifth and a sixth . 
And a seventh and an eighth . 
And this man does not look like a 65-year - old wheelchair - bound man . 
He was so happy . 
We are living on a precious jewel , and it 's during our lifetime that we 're moving off this planet . 
Please join us in this epic adventure . 
Thank you so much .

David Bolinsky animates a cell 
I 'm a medical illustrator , and I come from a slightly different point of view . 
I 've been watching , since I grew up , the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts and truth and beauty in the sciences . 
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right -- they both have very wonderful things going for them -- truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins that a scientist would want to date . 
These are expressions of truth as awe - full things , by meaning they are things you can worship . 
They are ideals that are powerful . They are irreducible . 
They are unique . They are useful -- sometimes , often a long time after the fact . 
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now , because I do n't want to look at me on the screen . 
Truth and beauty are things that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences . 
They are things that describe beauty in a way that is often only accessible if you understand the language and the syntax of the person who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed . 
If you look at the math , E = mc squared , if you look at the cosmological constant , where there 's an anthropic ideal , where you see that life had to evolve from the numbers that describe the universe -- these are things that are really difficult to understand . 
And what I 've tried to do since I had my training as a medical illustrator -- since I was taught animation by my father , who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- I wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation , by using pictures , by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth , and can be taught , and can be understood . 
Students today are often immersed in an environment where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty embedded in them , but the way they 're taught is compartmentalized and it 's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty are not always evident . 
It 's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone . 
We do n't want to do that to our students . 
So we have an opportunity to really open up education . 
And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard , in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department , a couple of years ago . He asked me if my team and I would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard . 
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell -- that would explore the truth and beauty inherent in molecular and cellular biology so that students could understand a larger picture that they could hang all of these facts on . 
They could have a mental image of the cell as a large , bustling , hugely complicated city that 's occupied by micro - machines . 
And these micro - machines really are at the heart of life . 
These micro - machines , which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over , are self - directed , powerful , precise , accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids . 
And these micro - machines power how a cell moves . 
They power how a cell replicates . They power our hearts . 
They power our minds . 
And so what we wanted to do was to figure out how we could make this story into an animation that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard , which is a website that Harvard has for its molecular and cellular biology students that will -- in addition to all the textual information , in addition to all the didactic stuff -- put everything together visually , so that these students would have an internalized view of what a cell really is in all of its truth and beauty , and be able to study with this view in mind , so that their imaginations would be sparked , so that their passions would be sparked and so that they would be able to go on and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries and to be able to find out , really , how life works . 
So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together . 
We worked with a theme , which is , you 've got macrophages that are streaming down a capillary , and they 're touching the surface of the capillary wall , and they 're picking up information from cells that are on the capillary wall , and they are given this information that there 's an inflammation somewhere outside , where they ca n't see and sense . 
But they get the information that causes them to stop , causes them to internalize that they need to make all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape , and try to get out of this capillary and find out what 's going on . 
So these molecular motors -- we had to work with the Harvard scientists and databank models of the atomically accurate molecules and figure out how they moved , and figure out what they did . 
And figure out how to do this in a way that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on , but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell would prevent the vista from happening . 
And so what I 'm going to show you is a three - minute Reader 's Digest version of the first aspect of this film that we produced . It 's an ongoing project that 's going to go another four or five years . 
And I want you to look at this and see the paths that the cell manufactures -- these little walking machines , they 're called kinesins -- that take these huge loads that would challenge an ant in relative size . 
Run the movie , please . 
But these machines that power the inside of the cells are really quite amazing , and they really are the basis of all life because all of these machines interact with each other . 
They pass information to each other . 
They cause different things to happen inside the cell . 
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs on the fly , from information that 's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes . 
No life , from the smallest life to everybody here , would be possible without these little micro - machines . 
In fact , it would really , in the absence of these machines , have made the attendance here , Chris , really quite sparse . 
This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell . 
This little guy is called the kinesin , and he pulls a sack that 's full of brand new manufactured proteins to wherever it 's needed in the cell -- whether it 's to a membrane , whether it 's to an organelle , whether it 's to build something or repair something . 
And each of us has about 100,000 of these things running around , right now , inside each one of your 100 trillion cells . 
So no matter how lazy you feel , you 're not really intrinsically doing nothing . 
So what I want you to do when you go home is think about this , and think about how powerful our cells are . 
And think about some of the things that we 're learning about cellular mechanics . 
Once we figure out all that 's going on -- and believe me , we know almost a percent of what 's going on -- once we figure out what 's going on , we 're really going to be able to have a lot of control over what we do with our health , with what we do with future generations , and how long we 're going to live . 
And hopefully we 'll be able to use this to discover more truth , and more beauty . 
But it 's really quite amazing that these cells , these micro - machines , are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding . 
They work together . They make the cell do what it needs to do . 
And their working together helps our bodies -- huge entities that they will never see -- function properly . 
Enjoy the rest of the show . Thank you .

Becky Blanton : The year I was homeless 
I 'm a writer and a journalist , and I 'm also an insanely curious person , so in 22 years as a journalist , I 've learned how to do a lot of new things . 
And three years ago , one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible . 
I became one of the working homeless . 
I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year , and decided to travel . 
His death hit me pretty hard . 
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that . 
I 've camped my whole life . And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip . 
So I packed my cat , my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van , and drove off into the sunset , having fully failed to realize three critical things . 
One : that society equates living in a permanent structure , even a shack , with having value as a person . 
Two : I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality , if we let it . 
Three : I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle . 
At first , living in the van was great . 
I showered in campgrounds . I ate out regularly . 
And I had time to relax and to grieve . 
But then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in . 
My freelance job ended . And I had to get a full - time job to pay the bills . 
What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer . 
And it became impossible to park anywhere -- -- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me , and it was really hot . 
The cat came and went through an open window in the van . 
The doggy went into doggy day care . 
And I sweated . 
Whenever I could , I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops . 
Or I washed up in public rest rooms . 
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit , making it difficult or impossible to sleep . 
Food rotted in the heat . 
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours , and it was pretty miserable . 
I could n't afford to find an apartment , or could n't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat . 
And I refused to give them up , so I stayed in the van . 
And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night , I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet . 
When winter weather set in , the temperatures dropped below freezing . And they stayed there . 
And I faced a whole new set of challenges . 
I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police . 
I did n't always succeed . 
But I felt out of control of my life . 
And I do n't know when or how it happened , but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away . 
I had n't changed . My I.Q. had n't dropped . 
My talent , my integrity , my values , everything about me remained the same . 
But I had changed somehow . 
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression . 
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic . 
And I went . I had n't bathed in three days . 
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line . 
I just was n't drunk or high . 
And when several of the homeless men realized that , including a former university professor , they said , " You are n't homeless . Why are you really here ? " 
Other homeless people did n't see me as homeless , but I did . 
Then the professor listened to my story and he said , " You have a job . You have hope . 
The real homeless do n't have hope . " 
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal . And I remember thinking , " If I killed myself , no one would notice . " 
A friend told me , shortly after that , that she had heard that Tim Russert , a nationally renowned journalist , had been talking about me on national T.V. 
An essay I 'd written about my father , the year before he died , was in Tim 's new book . 
And he was doing the talk show circuit . And he was talking about my writing . 
And when I realized that Tim Russert , former moderator of " Meet the Press , " was talking about my writing , while I was living in a van in a Wal - Mart parking lot , I started laughing . 
You should too . 
I started laughing because it got to the point where , was I a writer , or was I a homeless woman ? 
So I went in the bookstore . And I found Tim 's book . 
And I stood there . And I reread my essay . 
And I cried . 
Because I was a writer . 
I was a writer . 
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee . 
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends . 
And I started writing again . 
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist . 
I was winning awards . I was living in my own apartment . 
I was no longer homeless . 
And I was no longer invisible . 
Thousands of people work full and part - time jobs , and live in their cars . 
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets . 
So the homeless , the working homeless , primarily remain invisible . 
But if you ever meet one , engage them , encourage them , and offer them hope . 
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope . 
And I 'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless . 
I 'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet . 
But I am here to tell you that , based on my experience , people are not where they live , where they sleep , or what their life situation is at any given time . 
Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal - Mart parking lot , and today I 'm speaking at TED . 
Hope always , always finds a way . Thank you .

At TEDxChange , Thailand 's " Mr. Condom , " Mechai Viravaidya , walks us through the country 's bold plan to raise its standard of living , starting in the 1970s . First step : population control . And that means a lot of frank , funny -- and very effective -- talk about condoms .

Mechai Viravaidya : How Mr. Condom made Thailand a better place 
Welcome to Thailand . 
Now , when I was a young man -- 40 years ago , the country was very , very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty . 
We decided to do something about it , but we did n't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program . 
But we began with a family - planning program , following a very successful maternal child health activity , sets of activities . 
So basically , no one would accept family planning if their children did n't survive . 
So the first step : get to the children , get to the mothers , and then follow up with family planning . 
Not just child mortality alone , you need also family planning . 
Now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it . 
In my country , that was the case in 1974 . 
Seven children per family -- tremendous growth at 3.3 percent . 
There was just no future . 
We needed to reduce the population growth rate . 
So we said , " Let 's do it . " 
The women said , " We agree . We 'll use pills , but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills , " and we had very , very few doctors . 
We did n't take no as an answer ; we took no as a question . 
We went to the nurses and the midwives , who were also women , and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill . 
That was wonderful , but it covered only 20 percent of the country . 
What do we do for the other 80 percent -- leave them alone and say , " Well , they 're not medical personnel . " 
No , we decided to do a bit more . 
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw . 
Actually , below that yellow sign -- I wish they had n't wiped that , because there was " Coca - Cola " there . 
We were so much bigger than Coca - Cola in those days . 
And no difference , the people they chose were the people we chose . 
They were well - known in the community , they knew that customers were always right , and they were terrific , and they practiced their family planning themselves . 
So they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country , in every village of the country . 
So there we are . We went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution . 
Wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women , selling things -- here 's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people , you 'll find contraceptives in Thailand . 
And then we decided , why not get to religion because in the Philippines , the Catholic Church was pretty strong , and Thai people were Buddhist . 
We went to them and they said , " Look , could you help us ? " 
I 'm there -- the one in blue , not the yellow -- holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family . 
And this picture was sent throughout the country . 
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves . 
And the women were saying , " No wonder we have no side - effects . 
It 's been blessed . " 
That was their perception . 
And then we went to teachers . 
You need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place . 
So we went to the teachers . 
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet -- A , B for birth , C for condom , I for IUD , V for vasectomy . 
And then we had a snakes and ladders game , where you throw dice . 
If you land on anything pro - family planning , you move ahead . 
Like , " Mother takes the pill every night . 
Very good , mother . Move ahead . 
Uncle buys a condom . Very good , uncle . Move ahead . 
Uncle gets drunk , does n't use condom . Come back , start again . " 
Again , education , class entertainment . 
And the kids were doing it in school too . 
We had relay races with condoms , we had children 's condom - blowing championship . 
And before long , the condom was know as the girl 's best friend . 
In Thailand , for poor people , diamonds do n't make it -- so the condom is the girl 's best friend . 
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 , and the women who organized it said , " We only want to lend to women who practice family planning . 
If you 're pregnant , take care of your pregnancy . 
If you 're not pregnant , you can take a loan out from us . " 
And that was run by them . 
And after 35/36 years , it 's still going on . 
It 's a part of the Village Development Bank ; it 's not a real bank , but it 's a fund -- microcredit . 
And we did n't need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves . 
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there , it 's always women , women , women , women . 
And then we thought we 'd help America , because America 's been helping everyone , whether they want help or not . 
And this is on the Fourth of July . 
We decided to provide vasectomy to all men , but in particular , American men to the front of the queue , right up to the Ambassador 's residence during his [ unclear ] . 
And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it -- very appropriate room . 
And since it was near lunch time , they said , " All right , we 'll give you some lunch . 
Of course , it must be American cola . 
You get two brands , Coke and Pepsi . 
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog . " 
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic . 
And here is this , then , young man called Willy Bohm who worked for the USAID . 
Obviously , he 's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten , and he was very happy . 
It made a lot of news in America , and it angered some people also . 
I said , " Do n't worry . Come over and I 'll do the whole lot of you . " 
And what happened ? 
In all this thing , from seven children to 1.5 children , population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5 . 
You could call it the Coca - Cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing . 
I 'm not sure whether Coca - Cola followed us , or we followed Coca - Cola , but we 're good friends . 
And so that 's the case of everyone joining in . 
We did n't have a strong government . We did n't have lots of doctors . 
But it 's everybody 's job who can change attitude and behavior . 
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand , and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight AIDS . 
But unfortunately , the government was in denial , denial , denial . 
So our work was n't affected . 
So I thought , " Well , if you ca n't go to the government , go to the military . " 
So I went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations . 
They have more than the government , and they 've got more guns than the government . 
So I asked them , could they help us in our fight against HIV . 
And after I gave them statistics , they said , " Yes . Okay . You can use all the radio stations , television stations . " 
And that 's when we went onto the airwaves . 
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that . 
And he said , " Mechai , could you come and join ? " 
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot . 
So I said , " Okay . " 
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee and increased the budget fifty - fold . 
Every ministry , even judges , had to be involved in AIDS education -- everyone -- and we said the public , institutions , religious institutions , schools -- everyone was involved . 
And here , every media person had to be trained for HIV . 
And we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money . 
So they were happy with that . 
And then AIDS education in all schools , starting from university . 
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids . 
And the best teachers were the girls , not the boys , and they were terrific . 
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV were known as Mother Theresa . 
And then we went down one more step . 
These are primary school kids -- third , fourth grade -- going to every household in the village , every household in the whole of Thailand , giving AIDS information and a condom to every household , given by these young kids . 
And no parents objected , because we were trying to save lives , and this was a lifesaver . 
And we said , " Everyone needs to be involved . " 
So you have the companies also realizing that sick staff do n't work , and dead customers do n't buy . 
So they all trained . 
And then we have this Captain Condom , with his Harvard MBA , going to schools and night spots . 
And they loved him . You need a symbol of something . 
In every country , every program , you need a symbol , and this is probably the best thing he 's ever done with his MBA . 
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere , everywhere . 
In taxis , you get condoms . 
And also , in traffic , the policemen give you condoms -- our " cops and rubbers " programs . 
So , can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms ? 
Of course I can . And they 'd enjoy it immensely ; I see them standing around right now , everywhere . 
Imagine if they had condoms , giving out to all sorts of people . 
And then , new change , we had hair bands , clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season . 
And these were the condoms that we introduced . 
One says , " Weapon of mass protection . " 
We found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction , but we have found the weapon of mass protection : the condom . 
And then it says here , with the American flag , " Do n't leave home without it . " 
But I have some to give out afterward . 
But let me warn you , these are Thai - sized , so be very careful . 
And so you can see that condoms can do so many things . 
Look at this -- I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also . 
Stop global warming ; use condoms . 
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection . 
And let the next Olympics save some lives . 
Why just run around ? 
And then finally , in Thailand we 're Buddhist , we do n't have a God , so instead , we say , " In rubber we trust . " 
So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people . 
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools , because alcohol impairs judgment . 
And then what happened ? 
After all this time , everybody joined in . 
According to the U.N. , new cases of HIV declined by 90 percent , and according to the World Bank , 7.7 million lives were saved . 
Otherwise there would n't be many Thais walking around today . 
So it just showed you , you could do something about it . 
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand . 
There was political commitment , some financial commitment , and everybody joined in the fight . 
So just do n't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses . 
We all need to help . 
And then we decided to help people out of poverty , now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way -- this time , not with government alone , but in cooperation with the business community . 
Because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit . 
Those are the things to be provided by the business community . 
We 're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs , little business people . 
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise . 
So , that was done . 
The money goes from the company into the village via tree - planting . 
It 's not a free gift . 
They plant the trees , and the money goes into their microcredit fund , which we call the Village Development Bank . 
Everybody joins in , and they feel they own the bank , because they have brought the money in . 
And before you can borrow the money , you need to be trained . 
And we believe if you want to help the poor , those who are living in poverty , access to credit must be a human right . 
Access to credit must be a human right . 
Otherwise they 'll never get out of poverty . 
And then before getting a loan , you must be trained . 
Here 's what we call a " barefoot MBA , " teaching people how to do business so that , when they borrow money , they 'll succeed with the business . 
These are some of the businesses : mushrooms , crabs , vegetables , trees , fruits , and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits ; this is a village sponsored by Nike . 
They said , " They should stop making shoes and clothes . 
Make these better , because we can afford them . " 
And then we have silk , Thai silk . 
Now we 're making Scottish tartans , as you can see on the left , to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors . 
So anyone sitting in and watching TV , get in touch with me . 
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand -- " Coffee and Condoms . " 
See , Starbucks you awake , we keep you awake and alive . 
That 's the difference . 
Can you imagine , at every Starbucks that you can also get condoms ? 
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino . 
And then now , finally in education , we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it 's a lifelong learning center for everyone . 
We call this our School - Based Integrated Rural Development . 
And it 's a center , a focal point for economic and social development . 
Re - do the school , make it serve the community needs . 
And here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo . 
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo . 
And I 'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very , very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome . 
And we use vegetables around the school ground , so they raise their own vegetables . 
And then , finally , I firmly believe , if we want the MDGs to work -- the Millennium Development Goals -- we need to add family planning to it . 
Of course , child mortality first and then family planning -- everyone needs family planning service -- it 's underutilized . 
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection . 
And we also ask the next Olympics to be involved in saving lives . 
And then , finally , that is our network . 
And these are our Thai tulips . 
Thank you very much indeed .

Your smartphone may feel like a friend -- but a true friend would give you a smile once in a while . At TED2013 , Keller Rinaudo demos Romo , the smartphone - powered mini robot who can motor along with you on a walk , slide you a cup of coffee across the table , and react to you with programmable expressions . 
robots , technology

Keller Rinaudo : A mini robot -- powered by your phone 
So just by a show of hands , how many of you all have a robot at home ? 
Not very many of you . 
Okay . And actually of those hands , if you do n't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home ? 
So a couple . 
That 's okay . 
That 's the problem that we 're trying to solve at Romotive -- that I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving . 
So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use , whether you 're eight or 80 . 
And as it turns out , that 's a really hard problem , because you have to build a small , portable robot that 's not only really affordable , but it has to be something that people actually want to take home and have around their kids . 
This robot ca n't be creepy or uncanny . 
He should be friendly and cute . 
So meet Romo . 
Romo 's a robot that uses a device you already know and love -- your iPhone -- as his brain . 
And by leveraging the power of the iPhone 's processor , we can create a robot that is wi - fi enabled and computer vision - capable for 150 bucks , which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past . 
When Romo wakes up , he 's in creature mode . 
So he 's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face . 
If I duck down , he 'll follow me . 
He 's wary , so he 'll keep his eyes on me . 
If I come over here , he 'll turn to follow me . 
If I come over here -- He 's smart . 
And if I get too close to him , he gets scared just like any other creature . 
So in a lot of ways , Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own . 
Thanks , little guy . 
Bless you . 
And if I want to explore the world -- uh - oh , Romo 's tired -- if I want to explore the world with Romo , I can actually connect him from any other iOS device . 
So here 's the iPad . 
And Romo will actually stream video to this device . 
So I can see everything that Romo sees , and I get a robot's - eye - view of the world . 
Now this is a free app on the App Store , so if any of you guys had this app on your phones , we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together . 
So I 'll show you really quickly , Romo actually -- he 's streaming video , so you can see me and the entire TED audience . 
If I get in front of Romo here . 
And if I want to control him , I can just drive . 
So I can drive him around , and I can take pictures of you . 
I 've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience . 
So I 'll snap a picture . 
And in the same way that you scroll through content on an iPad , I can actually adjust the angle of the camera on the device . 
So there are all of you through Romo 's eyes . 
And finally , because Romo is an extension of me , I can express myself through his emotions . 
So I can go in and I can say let 's make Romo excited . 
But the most important thing about Romo is that we wanted to create something that was literally completely intuitive . 
You do not have to teach someone how to drive Romo . 
In fact , who would like to drive a robot ? 
Okay . Awesome . 
Here you go . 
Thank you , Scott . 
And even cooler , you actually do n't have to be in the same geographic location as the robot to control him . 
So he actually streams two - way audio and video between any two smart devices . 
So you can log in through the browser , and it 's kind of like Skype on wheels . 
So we were talking before about telepresence , and this is a really cool example . 
You can imagine an eight - year - old girl , for example , who has an iPhone , and her mom buys her a robot . 
That girl can take her iPhone , put it on the robot , send an email to Grandma , who lives on the other side of the country . 
Grandma can log into that robot and play hide - and - go - seek with her granddaughter for fifteen minutes every single night , when otherwise she might only be able to get to see her granddaughter once or twice a year . 
Thanks , Scott . 
So those are a couple of the really cool things that Romo can do today . 
But I just want to finish by talking about something that we 're working on in the future . 
This is actually something that one of our engineers , Dom , built in a weekend . 
It 's built on top of a Google open framework called Blockly . 
This allows you to drag and drop these blocks of semantic code and create any behavior for this robot you want . 
You do not have to know how to code to create a behavior for Romo . 
And you can actually simulate that behavior in the browser , which is what you see Romo doing on the left . 
And then if you have something you like , you can download it onto your robot and execute it in real life , run the program in real life . 
And then if you have something you 're proud of , you can share it with every other person who owns a robot in the world . 
So all of these wi - fi – enabled robots actually learn from each other . 
The reason we 're so focused on building robots that everyone can train is that we think the most compelling use cases in personal robotics are personal . 
They change from person to person . 
So we think that if you 're going to have a robot in your home , that robot ought to be a manifestation of your own imagination . 
So I wish that I could tell you what the future of personal robotics looks like . 
To be honest , I have no idea . 
But what we do know is that it is n't 10 years or 10 billion dollars or a large humanoid robot away . 
The future of personal robotics is happening today , and it 's going to depend on small , agile robots like Romo and the creativity of people like yourselves . 
So we ca n't wait to get you all robots , and we ca n't wait to see what you build . 
Thank you .

Isabel Allende tells tales of passion 
Thank you so much . It 's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart . 
I 'm here to tell you a few tales of passion . 
There 's a Jewish saying that I love . 
What is truer than truth ? Answer : The story . 
I 'm a storyteller . I want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity . 
All stories interest me , and some haunt me until I end up writing them . 
Certain themes keep coming up : justice , loyalty , violence , death , political and social issues , freedom . 
I 'm aware of the mystery around us , so I write about coincidences , premonitions , emotions , dreams , the power of nature , magic . 
In the last 20 years I have published a few books , but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006 , when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy . 
That made me a celebrity . Now people recognize me in Macy 's , and my grandchildren think that I 'm cool . 
Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame . 
One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony , of the opening ceremony , called me and said that I had been selected to be one of the flag - bearers . 
I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because I 'm as far as you can get from being an athlete . 
Actually , I was n't even sure that I could go around the stadium without a walker . 
I was told that this was no laughing matter . 
This would be the first time that only women would carry the Olympic flag . 
Five women , representing five continents , and three Olympic gold medal winners . 
My first question was , naturally , what was I going to wear ? 
A uniform , she said , and asked for my measurements . 
My measurements . 
I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak , looking like the Michelin Man . 
By the middle of February , I found myself in Turin , where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street . 
Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games . 
They all deserved to win , but there 's the element of luck . 
A speck of snow , an inch of ice , the force of the wind , can determine the result of a race or a game . 
However , what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart . 
Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal . 
It is all about passion . 
The streets of Turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the Olympics . 
Passion lives here . Is n't it always true ? 
Heart is what drives us and determines our fate . 
That is what I need for my characters in my books : a passionate heart . 
I need mavericks , dissidents , adventurers , outsiders and rebels , who ask questions , bend the rules and take risks . 
People like all of you in this room . 
Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters . 
They only make good former spouses . 
In the green room of the stadium , I met the other flag bearers : three athletes , and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren . 
Also , two women with passionate hearts : Wangari Maathai , the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya who has planted 30 million trees . And by doing so , she has changed the soil , the weather , in some places in Africa , and of course the economic conditions in many villages . 
And Somaly Mam , a Cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution . 
When she was 14 years old , her grandfather sold her to a brothel . 
She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS . 
And of brothels where children are forced to receive five , 15 clients per day , and if they rebel , they are tortured with electricity . 
In the green room I received my uniform . 
It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear , but it was far from the Michelin Man suit that I had anticipated . Not bad , really . 
I looked like a refrigerator . 
But so did most of the flag - bearers , except Sophia Loren , the universal symbol of beauty and passion . 
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great . 
She 's sexy , slim and tall , with a deep tan . 
Now , how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles ? 
I do n't know . 
When asked in a TV interview , " How could she look so good ? " 
She replied , " Posture . My back is always straight , and I do n't make old people 's noises . " 
So , there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth . 
No grunting , no coughing , no wheezing , no talking to yourselves , no farting . 
Well , she did n't say that exactly . 
At some point around midnight , we were summoned to the wings of the stadium , and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag , and the music started -- by the way , the same music that starts here , the Aida March . 
Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she 's a foot taller than I am , not counting the poofy hair . 
She walked elegantly , like a giraffe on the African savannah , holding the flag on her shoulder . I jogged behind -- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm , so that my head was actually under the damn flag . 
All the cameras were , of course , on Sophia . 
That was fortunate for me , because in most press photos I appear too , although often between Sophia 's legs . 
A place where most men would love to be . 
The best four minutes of my entire life were those in the Olympic stadium . 
My husband is offended when I say this -- although I have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes -- -- so he should n't take it personally . 
I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes , because I do n't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells . 
I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics -- passion . 
So here 's a tale of passion . 
The year is 1998 , the place is a prison camp for Tutsi refugees in Congo . 
By the way , 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls . 
We can call this place in Congo a death camp , because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation . 
The protagonists of this story are a young woman , Rose Mapendo , and her children . 
She 's pregnant and a widow . 
Soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed . 
Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive , and a few months later , she gives birth to premature twins . 
Two tiny little boys . 
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick , and ties it with her own hair . 
She names the twins after the camp 's commanders to gain their favor , and feeds them with black tea because her milk can not sustain them . 
When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter , she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go , even when they hold a gun to her head . 
Somehow , the family survives for 16 months , and then , by extraordinary luck , and the passionate heart of a young American man , Sasha Chanoff , who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane , Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix , Arizona , where they 're now living and thriving . 
Mapendo , in Swahili , means great love . 
The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like Rose Mapendo . 
I do n't make them up . There 's no need for that . 
I look around and I see them everywhere . 
I have worked with women and for women all my life . 
I know them well . 
I was born in ancient times , at the end of the world , in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family . 
No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist -- although the term had not reached Chile yet , so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me . 
I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom , and for questioning the patriarchy . 
But I was happy to pay it , because for every blow that I received , I was able to deliver two . 
Once , when my daughter Paula was in her twenties , she said to me that feminism was dated , that I should move on . 
We had a memorable fight . Feminism is dated ? 
Yes , for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today , but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage , prostitution , forced labor -- they have children that they do n't want or they can not feed . 
They have no control over their bodies or their lives . 
They have no education and no freedom . 
They are raped , beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity . 
For most Western young women of today , being called a feminist is an insult . 
Feminism has never been sexy , but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting , and I have seldom suffered from lack of men . 
Feminism is not dead , by no means . 
It has evolved . If you do n't like the term , change it , for Goddess ' sake . 
Call it Aphrodite , or Venus , or bimbo , or whatever you want ; the name does n't matter , as long as we understand what it is about , and we support it . 
So here 's another tale of passion , and this is a sad one . 
The place is a small women 's clinic in a village in Bangladesh . 
The year is 2005 . 
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three - week vacation . 
She 's prepared to clean teeth , but when she gets there , she finds out that there are no doctors , no dentists , and the clinic is just a hut full of flies . 
Outside , there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated . 
The first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars . 
Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth . 
She 's not licensed for that ; she has never done it . 
She risks a lot and she 's terrified . 
She does n't even have the proper instruments , but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine . 
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart . 
She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation . 
At the end , the relieved patient kisses her hands . 
That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth . 
The next morning , when she comes again to the so - called clinic , her first patient is waiting for her with her husband . 
The woman 's face looks like a watermelon . 
It is so swollen that you ca n't even see the eyes . 
The husband , furious , threatens to kill the American . 
Jenny is horrified at what she has done , but then the translator explains that the patient 's condition has nothing to do with the operation . 
The day before , her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him . 
Millions of women live like this today . 
They are the poorest of the poor . 
Although women do two - thirds of the world 's labor , they own less than one percent of the world 's assets . 
They are paid less than men for the same work if they 're paid at all , and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence , and they are constantly threatened by exploitation , violence and abuse . 
It is a fact that giving women education , work , the ability to control their own income , inherit and own property , benefits the society . 
If a woman is empowered , her children and her family will be better off . 
If families prosper , the village prospers , and eventually so does the whole country . 
Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya . 
She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees . 
She gets the women to plant new trees and water them , drop by drop . 
In a matter of five or six years , they have a forest , the soil is enriched , and the village is saved . 
The poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down . 
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy . 
For every dollar given to a women 's program , 20 dollars are given to men 's programs . 
Women are 51 percent of humankind . 
Empowering them will change everything -- more than technology and design and entertainment . 
I can promise you that women working together -- linked , informed and educated -- can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet . 
In any war today , most of the casualties are civilians , mainly women and children . They are collateral damage . 
Men run the world , and look at the mess we have . 
What kind of world do we want ? 
This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking . 
Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order ? 
We want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody , not only for the privileged . 
In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero 's paintings at the UC Berkeley library . 
No museum or gallery in the United States , except for the New York gallery that carries Botero 's work , has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the Abu Ghraib prison . 
They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power , in the voluminous Botero style . 
I have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart . 
What I fear most is power with impunity . 
I fear abuse of power , and the power to abuse . 
In our species , the alpha males define reality , and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules . 
The rules change all the time , but they always benefit them , and in this case , the trickle - down effect , which does not work in economics , works perfectly . 
Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom . 
Women and children , especially the poor , are at the bottom . 
Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse -- a woman or a child . 
I 'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender , income , race , and class . 
I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization . 
But for real change , we need feminine energy in the management of the world . 
We need a critical number of women in positions of power , and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men . 
I 'm talking about men with young minds , of course . 
Old guys are hopeless ; we have to wait for them to die off . 
Yes , I would love to have Sophia Loren 's long legs and legendary breasts . 
But given a choice , I would rather have the warrior hearts of Wangari Maathai , Somaly Mam , Jenny and Rose Mapendo . 
I want to make this world good . 
Not better , but to make it good . 
Why not ? It is possible . Look around in this room -- all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology . 
Let 's get off our fannies , roll up our sleeves and get to work , passionately , in creating an almost perfect world . 
Thank you .

Every day , in a city the size of London , 30 million meals are served . But where does all the food come from ? Architect Carolyn Steel discusses the daily miracle of feeding a city , and shows how ancient food routes shaped the modern world .

Carolyn Steel : How food shapes our cities 
How do you feed a city ? 
It 's one of the great questions of our time . 
Yet it 's one that 's rarely asked . 
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant , or indeed into this theater 's foyer in about an hour 's time , there is going to be food there waiting for us , having magically come from somewhere . 
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London , enough food has to be produced , transported , bought and sold , cooked , eaten , disposed of , and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth , it 's remarkable that cities get fed at all . 
We live in places like this as if they 're the most natural things in the world , forgetting that because we 're animals and that we need to eat , we 're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were . 
And as more of us move into cities , more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it 's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil -- in order to feed us . 
These are extraordinary landscapes , but few of us ever get to see them . 
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either . 
As more of us move into cities , more of us are eating meat , so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals . 
And given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it 's passed through an animal first , that 's not a very efficient way of feeding us . 
And it 's an escalating problem too . 
By 2050 , it 's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities . 
And it 's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed . 
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand . 
And that 's going to pose an enormous problem . 
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed , by 2050 . 
That 's a big problem . And actually if we carry on as we are , it 's a problem we 're very unlikely to be able to solve . 
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land . 
Although at the same time we 're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion . 
We 're very hungry for fossil fuels too . 
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West . 
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we do n't actually value it . 
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away . 
And to end all of this , at the end of this long process , we 're not even managing to feed the planet properly . 
A billion of us are obese , while a further billion starve . 
None of it makes very much sense . 
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations , it 's a grim picture . 
As we 're moving into cities , the world is also embracing a Western diet . 
And if we look to the future , it 's an unsustainable diet . 
So how did we get here ? 
And more importantly , what are we going to do about it ? 
Well , to answer the slightly easier question first , about 10,000 years ago , I would say , is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East , known as the Fertile Crescent . 
Because , as you can see , it was crescent shaped . 
And it was also fertile . 
And it was here , about 10,000 years ago , that two extraordinary inventions , agriculture and urbanism , happened roughly in the same place and at the same time . 
This is no accident , because agriculture and cities are bound together . They need each other . 
Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements . 
And if we look at what those settlements were like , we see they were compact . 
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur , that were , in fact , effectively , spiritualized , central food distribution centers . 
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest , gathered in the grain , offered it to the gods , and then offered the grain that the gods did n't eat back to the people . 
So , if you like , the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them . 
And in fact , that 's true of every ancient city . 
But of course not all of them were that small . 
Famously , Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D. 
So how did a city like this feed itself ? 
The answer is what I call " ancient food miles . " 
Basically , Rome had access to the sea , which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away . 
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world , because it was very difficult to transport food over roads , which were rough . 
And the food obviously went off very quickly . 
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves . 
And , in fact , you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long , drawn out militarized shopping spree , really . 
In fact -- I love the fact , I just have to mention this : Rome in fact used to import oysters from London , at one stage . I think that 's extraordinary . 
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite . 
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre - industrial world . 
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century , we can see that its grain , which is coming in from the Thames , along the bottom of this map . 
So the grain markets were to the south of the city . 
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside , which was the main market , were also grain markets . 
And if you look at the name of one of those streets , Bread Street , you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago . 
And the same of course was true for fish . 
Fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . Same thing . 
And of course Billingsgate , famously , was London 's fish market , operating on - site here until the mid-1980s . 
Which is extraordinary , really , when you think about it . 
Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port . 
This is another thing about food in cities : Once its roots into the city are established , they very rarely move . 
Meat is a very different story because , of course , animals could walk into the city . 
So much of London 's meat was coming from the northwest , from Scotland and Wales . 
So it was coming in , and arriving at the city at the northwest , which is why Smithfield , London 's very famous meat market , was located up there . 
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on , to the northeast . 
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this . Anyway , and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes . 
And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside , that 's where they were sold , which is why it 's called Poultry . 
And , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can trace food coming in to it . 
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food , both by reading the names of the streets , which give you a lot of clues . 
Friday Street , in a previous life , is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday . 
But also you have to imagine it full of food . 
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold . 
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from . 
In fact , if you were having Sunday lunch , the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier . 
So this was obviously an organic city , part of an organic cycle . 
And then 10 years later everything changed . 
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840 . 
And as you can see , some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep . 
So all of a sudden , these animals are no longer walking into market . 
They 're being slaughtered out of sight and mind , somewhere in the countryside . 
And they 're coming into the city by rail . 
And this changes everything . 
To start off with , it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities , really any size and shape , in any place . 
Cities used to be constrained by geography ; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means . 
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography . 
And as you can see from these maps of London , in the 90 years after the trains came , it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot , and so on , to a large splurge , that would be very , very difficult to feed with anybody on foot , either animals or people . 
And of course that was just the beginning . After the trains came cars , and really this marks the end of this process . 
It 's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all . 
And this is the kind of city that 's devoid of smell , devoid of mess , certainly devoid of people , because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape . 
In fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week 's worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it . 
And this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely . 
Here we have food -- that used to be the center , the social core of the city -- at the periphery . 
It used to be a social event , buying and selling food . 
Now it 's anonymous . 
We used to cook ; now we just add water , or a little bit of an egg if you 're making a cake or something . 
We do n't smell food to see if it 's okay to eat . 
We just read the back of a label on a packet . 
And we do n't value food . We do n't trust it . 
So instead of trusting it , we fear it . 
And instead of valuing it , we throw it away . 
One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they 've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder . 
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place , they 've actually distanced us from our most important relationship , which is that of us and nature . 
And also they 've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver , that , as we 've seen , are unsustainable . 
So what are we going to do about that ? 
It 's not a new question . 
500 years ago it 's what Thomas More was asking himself . 
This is the frontispiece of his book " Utopia . " 
And it was a series of semi - independent city - states , if that sounds remotely familiar , a day 's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming - mad , and grew vegetables in their back gardens , and ate communal meals together , and so on . 
And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia , even though More never framed it that way . 
And here is another very famous " Utopian " vision , that of Ebenezer Howard , " The Garden City . " 
Same idea : series of semi - independent city - states , little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around , joined to one another by railway . 
And again , food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision . 
It even got built , but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had . 
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas , that they are Utopian . 
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately . 
It was a kind of joke , because it 's got a double derivation from the Greek . 
It can either mean a good place , or no place . 
Because it 's an ideal . It 's an imaginary thing . We ca n't have it . 
And I think , as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling , that makes it not much use . 
So I 've come up with an alternative , which is Sitopia , from the ancient Greek , " sitos " for food , and " topos " for place . 
I believe we already live in Sitopia . 
We live in a world shaped by food , and if we realize that , we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool , design tool , to shape the world differently . 
So if we were to do that , what might Sitopia look like ? 
Well I think it looks a bit like this . 
I have to use this slide . It 's just the look on the face of the dog . 
But anyway , this is -- it 's food at the center of life , at the center of family life , being celebrated , being enjoyed , people taking time for it . 
This is where food should be in our society . 
But you ca n't have scenes like this unless you have people like this . 
By the way , these can be men as well . 
It 's people who think about food , who think ahead , who plan , who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them . 
We need these people . We 're part of a network . 
Because without these kinds of people we ca n't have places like this . 
Here , I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable . 
But networks , markets where food is being grown locally . 
It 's common . It 's fresh . 
It 's part of the social life of the city . 
Because without that , you ca n't have this kind of place , food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape , and is not just a zero - sum commodity off in some unseen hell - hole . 
Cows with a view . 
Steaming piles of humus . 
This is basically bringing the whole thing together . 
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto . 
It 's a greenhouse , where kids get told all about food and growing their own food . 
Here is a plant called Kevin , or maybe it 's a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin . I do n't know . 
But anyway , these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important . 
So Sitopia , for me , is really a way of seeing . 
It 's basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere . 
The trick is to join them up , to use food as a way of seeing . 
And if we do that , we 're going to stop seeing cities as big , metropolitan , unproductive blobs , like this . 
We 're going to see them more like this , as part of the productive , organic framework of which they are inevitably a part , symbiotically connected . 
But of course , that 's not a great image either , because we need not to be producing food like this anymore . 
We need to be thinking more about permaculture , which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing . 
It 's a re - conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives . 
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago . 
It 's Ambrogio Lorenzetti 's " Allegory of Good Government . " 
It 's about the relationship between the city and the countryside . 
And I think the message of this is very clear . 
If the city looks after the country , the country will look after the city . 
And I want us to ask now , what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today ? 
What would an allegory of good government look like today ? 
Because I think it 's an urgent question . 
It 's one we have to ask , and we have to start answering . 
We know we are what we eat . 
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat . 
But if we take that idea , we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better . 
Thank you very much .

Weeks from the Charter for Compassion launch , Karen Armstrong looks at religion 's role in the 21st century : Will its dogmas divide us ? Or will it unite us for common good ? She reviews the catalysts that can drive the world 's faiths to rediscover the Golden Rule .

Karen Armstrong : Let 's revive the Golden Rule 
For years I 've been feeling frustrated , because as a religious historian , I 've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths . 
Every single one of them has evolved their own version of what 's been called the Golden Rule . 
Sometimes it comes in a positive version -- " Always treat all others as you 'd like to be treated yourself . " 
And equally important is the negative version -- " Do n't do to others what you would not like them to do to you . " 
Look into your own heart , discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse , under any circumstance whatsoever , to inflict that pain on anybody else . 
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion , not just because it sounds good , but because it works . 
People have found that when they have implemented the Golden Rule as Confucius said , " all day and every day , " not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism , but to do it all day and every day , you dethrone yourself from the center of your world , put another there , and you transcend yourself . 
And it brings you into the presence of what 's been called God , Nirvana , Rama , Tao . 
Something that goes beyond what we know in our ego - bound existence . 
But you know you 'd never know it a lot of the time , that this was so central to the religious life . 
Because with a few wonderful exceptions , very often when religious people come together , religious leaders come together , they 're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort . 
Often people do n't really want to be compassionate . 
I sometimes see when I 'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead . 
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise . 
Now why was I so grateful to TED ? 
Because they took me very gently from my book - lined study and brought me into the 21st century , enabling me to speak to a much , much wider audience than I could have ever conceived . 
Because I feel an urgency about this . 
If we do n't manage to implement the Golden Rule globally , so that we treat all peoples , wherever and whoever they may be , as though they were as important as ourselves , I doubt that we 'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation . 
The task of our time , one of the great tasks of our time , is to build a global society , as I said , where people can live together in peace . 
And the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem . 
And of course it 's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule . 
This is the source of all morality , this imaginative act of empathy , putting yourself in the place of another . 
And so we have a choice , it seems to me . 
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith , or we can go back to the rabbis . Rabbi Hillel , the older contemporary of Jesus , who , when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg , said , " That which is hateful to you , do not do to your neighbor . 
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary . " 
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate . 
And we need to revive that spirit . 
And it 's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down . 
We have to make this happen , and we can do it with the modern communications that TED has introduced . 
Already I 've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners . 
In Singapore , we have a group going to use the Charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society , and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically . 
In Malaysia , there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people , young people , and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art . 
Throughout Europe , the Muslim communities are holding events and discussions , are discussing the centrality of compassion in Islam and in all faiths . 
But it ca n't stop there . It ca n't stop with the launch . 
Religious teaching , this is where we 've gone so wrong , concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines . 
Religious teaching must always lead to action . 
And I intend to work on this till my dying day . 
And I want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking . 
Education because we 've so dropped out of compassion . 
People often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody . 
But of course you do n't understand compassion if you 're just going to think about it . 
You also have to do it . 
I want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people , which are dividing us from one another . 
The same applies to educators . 
I 'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism , the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle . 
And also see that it demands acute intelligence , not just a gooey feeling . 
I 'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people 's traditions . 
And perhaps above all , to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking , so that because people have this Charter , whatever their beliefs or lack of them , they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech , disdainful remarks from their religious leaders , their political leaders , from the captains of industry . 
Because we can change the world , we have the ability . 
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online . 
I was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement . 
And TED introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas . 
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED . 
In this room , all this expertise , if we joined it all together , we could change the world . 
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable . 
But I 'd just like to quote , finish at the end with a reference to a British author , an Oxford author whom I do n't quote very often , C.S. Lewis . 
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl . 
It 's in his book " The Four Loves . " 
He said that he distinguished between erotic love , when two people gaze , spellbound , into each other 's eyes . 
And then he compared that to friendship , when two people stand side by side , as it were , shoulder to shoulder , with their eyes fixed on a common goal . 
We do n't have to fall in love with each other , but we can become friends . 
And I am convinced . 
I felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at Vevey , that when people of all different persuasions come together , working side by side for a common goal , differences melt away . 
And we learn amity . 
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another . 
Thank you very much .

David Macaulay 's Rome Antics 
I draw to better understand things . 
Sometimes I make a lot of drawings and I still do n't understand what it is I 'm drawing . 
Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is best known for " The Way Things Work , " while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding , spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner . 
Who knew about extension managers ? 
I 've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions , but I did finally figure it out . I had to figure it out , because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector , so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would . 
Now , I could talk about something that I 'm known for , something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here , or I could talk about something I really care about . 
I decided to go with the latter . 
I 'm going to talk about Rome . 
Now , why would I care about Rome , particularly ? 
Well , I went to Rhode Island School of Design in the second half of the ' 60s to study architecture . 
I was lucky enough to spend my last year , my fifth year , in Rome as a student . It changed my life . 
Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home , driving into RISD everyday , driving back . 
I missed the ' 60s . I read about them ; I understand they were pretty interesting . I missed them , but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome , and it 's a place that is never far from my mind . 
So , whenever given an opportunity , I try to do something in it or with it or for it . 
I also make drawings to help people understand things . 
Things that I want them to believe I understand . 
And that 's what I do as an illustrator , that 's my job . 
So , I 'm going to show you some pictures of Rome . 
I 've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years . 
These are just drawings of Rome . I get back as often as possible -- I need to . 
All different materials , all different styles , all different times , drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome . 
Part of the reason I 'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it . 
These are sketches of some of the little details . 
Rome is a city full of surprises . 
I mean , we 're talking about unusual perspectives , we 're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast , sun - drenched piazzas -- never , though , piazzas that are not humanly scaled . 
Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically . 
That amazing juxtaposition of old and new , the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that 's traveling above your head of usually blue -- especially in the summer -- compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets . 
And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form . 
How could I share my sense of Rome , my understanding of Rome ? 
And I 'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends , basically . 
The primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you 're not quite sure where you 're going , you 're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency . 
Here 's a little map . And I thought of maps at the beginning ; maybe I should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in Rome . 
And here 's a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page . 
Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways . 
Maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this . 
Maybe I should get away from this map completely , and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air -- which happens in so many of the squares in the city -- and let it bounce off of things . And I 'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits . 
That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot . 
But even though I just started this presentation , this is not the first thing that I tried to do and I was getting sort of desperate . 
Eventually , I realized that I had really no content that I could count on , so I decided to move towards packaging . 
I mean , it seems to work for a lot of things . 
So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick . 
But one of the ideas that emerged from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show the different aspects of Rome . 
Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible . 
Quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter , and very slow walking through Rome , you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across . 
Anyways , I went back to the dirigible notion . 
Went to Alberto Santos - Dumont . 
Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so I could actually use it as a scale that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome . 
This thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of , but it would be like having a ruler -- sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler . 
Not that you know how long number 11 actually is , but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla , and so on and so forth . If you were interested . 
This is Beatrix . She has a dog named Ajax , she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible -- she 's assembling the structure , Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off . 
She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city . 
Over the Spanish Steps we go . 
A nice way to show that river , that stream sort of pouring down the hill . 
Unfortunately , just across the road from it or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius , and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression , as you can see , as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close , nudges it . 
This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the Column of Marcus Aurelius , which is really no more than a pile of quarters high -- thick quarters . Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio , completely ruining the symmetry , but that aside a spectacular place to visit . 
A spectacular framework , inside of which you see , usually , extraordinary blue sky . 
Over the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus . 
She parks her dirigible , lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside . 
The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around , and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole , getting a different kind of perspective , moving you around the space . Particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus . 
Unfortunately for her , the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon , and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of Rome , which would , from their point of view , naturally be hanging upside down . 
They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo , that little spiral structure you see there . 
She continues on her way over Piazza Navona . 
Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant , is reminded that it is lunchtime and she 's hungry . 
They keep on motoring towards the Campo de ' Fiori , which they soon reach . Ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace , which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon , and then is completely removed and does n't appear again until six or seven the following morning . 
Anyway , the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff . 
Unfortunately , when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto , Ajax makes a lunge for it . 
She 's managed to save the prosciutto , but in the process she loses the tablecloth , which you can see flying away in the upper left - hand corner . 
They continue without their tablecloth , looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch . 
They eventually discover a huge wall that 's filled with small holes , ideal for docking a dirigible because you 've got a place to tie up . 
Turns out to be the exterior wall -- that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum , so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view . 
At the end of lunch , they untie the anchor , they set off through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius , which has this lightning rod on top . 
Unfortunately , that 's a problem : they get a little too close , and when you 're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes . 
So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion . 
Marcello , on the other hand , is sort of a lazy guy , but he 's not due at work until about noon . 
So , the alarm goes off and it 's five to 12 or so . 
He gets up , leaps onto his scooter , races through the city past the church of Santa Maria della Pace , down the alleys , through the streets that tourists may be wandering through , disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn . 
That speed with which he is moving , I hope I have suggested in this little image , which , again , can be turned around and read from both sides because there 's text on the bottom and text on the top , one of which is upside down in this image . 
So , he keeps on moving , approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street . 
Waiter catches on , but it 's too late . 
And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter . 
Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine , but keeps on moving because this guy 's got a job to do . 
Removes some scaffolding . One of the reasons Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric , it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself , or we find it . 
Right through the Piazza della Rotonda , in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work . 
Marcello , as it turns out , is the driver of the number 64 bus , and if you 've been on the number 64 bus , you know that it 's driven with the same kind of exuberance as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter . 
And finally Carletto . You see his apartment in the upper left - hand corner . 
He 's looking at his table ; he 's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years , and he wants it to be perfect . 
He 's got candles out , he 's got flowers in the middle and he 's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses . 
But he 's not happy ; something 's wrong . 
The phone rings anyway , he 's called to the palazzo . 
He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip , but as compared to all the traveling we 've just seen , he 's sauntering . 
Everybody knows Carletto , because he 's in entertainment , actually ; he 's in television . 
He 's actually in television repair , which is why people know him . 
So they all have his number . 
He arrives at the palazzo , arrives at the big front door . 
Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian , who tells him that there 's been a disaster in the palazzo ; nobody 's TVs are working and there 's a big soccer game coming up , and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous . 
He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring , and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building , apartment by apartment , checking every television , checking every connection , hoping to find out what this problem is . 
He works his way up , finally , the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic . 
He opens the window of the attic , of course , and there 's a tablecloth wrapped around the building 's television antenna . 
He removes it , the problems are solved , everybody in the palazzo is happy . 
And of course , he also solves his own problem . 
All he has to do now , with a perfect table , is wait for her to arrive . 
That was the first attempt , but it did n't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome . 
So I thought , well , I 'll just do piazzas , and I 'll get inside and underneath and I 'll show these things growing and show why they 're shaped the way they are and so on . 
And then I thought , that 's too complicated . No , I 'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and I 'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale , so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space . 
Now that 's one drawing , so I thought maybe it 's time for Piranesi to meet Escher . 
You see that I 'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope . 
There 's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together . 
Then I thought , " Wait a minute , what am I doing ? " 
A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information , it 's a series of layers . 
I mean , you always peel one layer off another ; we think of them as pages , doing it a certain way . 
But think of them as layers . I mean , Rome is a place of layers -- horizontal layers , vertical layers -- and I thought , well just peeling off a page would allow me to -- if I got you thinking about it the right way -- would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers . 
The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome covers the scars ; the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down . 
If I do a foldout page on the left - hand side and let you just unfold it , you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue . 
You can see that in 1635 , it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever . 
Adaptations all get buried under the stucco . 
I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what 's going on inside of it . 
But more importantly , I could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks , or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco , which is more often the case . 
So it becomes slightly three - dimensional . 
I could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold -- double foldout page -- which , if you were like me reading a pop - up book as a child , you hopefully stick your head into . 
You wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time . 
And I 've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages . 
But then I thought , maybe I could be simpler here . 
Let 's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it . 
Here 's a book completely wide open . 
OK , if I do n't open the book the whole way , if I just open it 90 degrees , we 're looking down the front of the Pantheon , and we 're looking sort of at the top , more or less down on the square . 
And if I turn the book the other way , we 're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon . 
No foldouts , no tricks -- just a book that is n't open the whole way . 
That seemed promising . I thought , maybe I 'll do it inside and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book . 
So we get inside the Pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth . 
And I thought , maybe I 'm on the right track , but it sort of lost its human quality . 
So I went back to the notion of story , which is always a good thing to have if you 're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way . 
" Pigeon 's Progress " struck me as a catchy title . 
If it was a homing pigeon , it would be called " Homer 's Odyssey . " 
But it was the journey of the ... 
I mean , if a title works , use it . But it would be a journey that went through Rome and showed all the things that I like about Rome . 
It 's a pigeon sitting on top of a church . 
Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff . Comes back , the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting and there 's no way this pigeon can get home . 
So it 's a homeless pigeon now and it 's going to have to find another place to live , and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things , and we start with the tall ones and so on . 
Maybe it has to go back and live with family members ; that 's not always a good thing , but it does sort of bring pigeons together again . 
And I thought , that 's sort of interesting , but maybe there 's a person who should be involved in this in some way . 
So I kind of came up with this old guy who spends his life looking after sick pigeons . 
He 'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot -- and they become really friends with this guy , and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that . 
There 's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons . 
But unfortunately he gets sick . He gets really sick at the end of the story . 
He 's taught them to spell his name , which is Aldo . 
They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him -- he lives in this little garret -- and they spell his name and fly around . 
And he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof , and all the pigeons , a la Red Balloon , are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city . 
And I forgot to mention this : whenever he lost a pigeon , he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city . 
In the old Roman custom , the dead were never buried within the walls . 
And I thought that 's a really cheery story . 
. That 's really going to go a long way . 
So anyway , I went through ... And again , if packaging does n't work and if the stories are n't going anywhere , I just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction . 
And sometimes it does focus me enough and I 'll even do a title page . 
So , these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution I settled on , which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city . 
And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here . 
You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way . 
If you see the red line , you are seeing the trail of the pigeon ; if you do n't see the red line , you are the pigeon . 
And it becomes necessary and possible , at this point , to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving . 
Past the Pyramid of Cestius -- these will seem very familiar to you , even if you have n't been to Rome recently -- past the gatehouse . 
This is something that 's a little bit unusual . 
This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do : it takes the scenic route , which was a device that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages . 
So , we circle around the Coliseum , past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin and the Temple of Hercules towards the river . 
We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese -- designed by Michelangelo , built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape . 
We swoop down over the Campo de ' Fiori . 
This is one of those things I show to my students because it 's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective . 
The only rule of perspective that I think matters is if it looks believable , you 've succeeded . 
But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here ; a couple are on Mars and a couple of others in Cremona . 
But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace , where invariably a soccer game is going on , and we 're hit by a soccer ball . 
Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball . 
I have all the pieces : there 's Santa Maria della Pace , there 's a soccer ball , there 's a little bit of a bird 's wing -- nothing 's happening , so I had to rethink it . 
And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace , these books are really flexible , incredibly interactive -- just turn it around and look at it the other way . 
Through the alley , we can see the impact is captured in the red line . 
And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower -- one of the few remaining medieval towers -- towards the church of Sant'Agnese and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona -- which we 've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times ; there 's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers -- and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo , stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus of the Pantheon to catch our breath . 
And then we can swoop inside and around ; and because we 're flying , we do n't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time , so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page . 
We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu ; it 's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way . 
Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about ; beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon " Ristorante " sign , and so on . 
And eventually , we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo , which is our destination . 
Straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the attic , where somebody is working at the drawing board . 
He removes the message from the leg of the bird ; this is what it says . 
As we look at the drawing board , we see what he 's working on is , in fact , a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken , and the red line extends through all the sights . 
And if you want the information , so that we complete this cycle of understanding , all you have to do is read these paragraphs . 
Thank you very much . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/skylar_tibbits_can_we_make_things_that_make_themselves.html 
MIT researcher Skylar Tibbits works on self - assembly -- the idea that instead of building something , we can create materials that build themselves , much the way a strand of DNA zips itself together . It 's a big concept at early stages ; Tibbits shows us three in - the - lab projects that hint at what a self - assembling future might look like . 
design , technology

Skylar Tibbits : Can we make things that make themselves ? 
Today I 'd like to show you the future of the way we make things . 
I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self - assembling , replicating and repairing themselves . 
So I 'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing , and then compare that to some natural systems . 
So in the current state of manufacturing , we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [ of assembly time ] , 500,000 to a million parts , fairly complex , new , exciting technologies in steel , concrete , glass . 
We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [ of assembly time ] , 2.5 million parts . 
But on the other side , if you look at the natural systems , we have proteins that have two million types , can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds , or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour . 
So there 's all of this complexity in our natural systems , but they 're extremely efficient , far more efficient than anything we can build , far more complex than anything we can build . 
They 're far more efficient in terms of energy . 
They hardly ever make mistakes . 
And they can repair themselves for longevity . 
So there 's something super interesting about natural systems . 
And if we can translate that into our built environment , then there 's some exciting potential for the way that we build things . 
And I think the key to that is self - assembly . 
So if we want to utilize self - assembly in our physical environment , I think there 's four key factors . 
The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines . 
And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work . 
Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up , or reconfigure . 
We need some energy that 's going to allow that to activate , allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program . 
And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want . 
So I 'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self - assembling future . 
The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot . 
So these projects are large - scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft . , 12 ft . long proteins . 
They 're embedded with mechanical electrical devices , sensors . 
You decode what you want to fold up into , into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120 , negative 120 , 0 , 0 , 120 , negative 120 -- something like that ; so a sequence of angles , or turns , and you send that sequence through the string . 
Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that , checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor . 
So these are the brilliant scientists , engineers , designers that worked on this project . 
And I think it really brings to light : Is this really scalable ? 
I mean , thousands of dollars , lots of man hours made to make this eight - foot robot . 
Can we really scale this up ? Can we really embed robotics into every part ? 
The next one questions that and looks at passive nature , or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability . 
But it goes a step further , and it tries to have actual computation . 
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts . 
So this is a NAND gate . 
You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that 's going to do your computing , and you have two input tetrahedrons . 
One of them is the input from the user , as you 're building your bricks . 
The other one is from the previous brick that was placed . 
And then it gives you an output in 3D space . 
So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do . 
It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do . 
And now it starts moving in three - dimensional space -- so up or down . 
So on the left - hand side , [ 1,1 ] input equals 0 output , which goes down . 
On the right - hand side , [ 0,0 ] input is a 1 output , which goes up . 
And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build . 
So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed . 
So that means that we can have some form of self - replication . 
In this case I call it self - guided replication , because your structure contains the exact blueprints . 
If you have errors , you can replace a part . 
All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it . 
So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one . 
It 's directly embedded ; there 's no external instructions . 
So the last project I 'll show is called Biased Chains , and it 's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self - assembly systems . 
So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system . 
So basically you have a chain of elements . 
Each element is completely identical , and they 're biased . 
So each chain , or each element , wants to turn right or left . 
So as you assemble the chain , you 're basically programming it . 
You 're telling each unit if it should turn right or left . 
So when you shake the chain , it then folds up into any configuration that you 've programmed in -- so in this case , a spiral , or in this case , two cubes next to each other . 
So you can basically program any three - dimensional shape -- or one - dimensional , two - dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively . 
So what does this tell us about the future ? 
I think that it 's telling us that there 's new possibilities for self - assembly , replication , repair in our physical structures , our buildings , machines . 
There 's new programmability in these parts . 
And from that you have new possibilities for computing . 
We 'll have spatial computing . 
Imagine if our buildings , our bridges , machines , all of our bricks could actually compute . 
That 's amazing parallel and distributed computing power , new design possibilities . 
So it 's exciting potential for this . 
So I think these projects I 've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future , if we implement these new technologies for a new self - assembling world . 
Thank you . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/nathan_wolfe_what_s_left_to_explore.html 
We 've been to the moon , we 've mapped the continents , we 've even been to the deepest point in the ocean -- twice . What 's left for the next generation to explore ? Biologist and explorer Nathan Wolfe suggests this answer : Almost everything . And we can start , he says , with the world of the unseeably small . 
biodiversity , exploration , microbiology , science

Nathan Wolfe : What 's left to explore ? 
Recently I visited Beloit , Wisconsin . 
And I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer , Roy Chapman Andrews . 
During his time at the American Museum of Natural History , Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions , like here in the Gobi Desert . 
He was quite a figure . 
He was later , it 's said , the basis of the Indiana Jones character . 
And when I was in Beloit , Wisconsin , I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students . 
And I 'm here to tell you , if there 's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED , it 'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand 12-year - olds for a 45-minute lecture . 
Do n't try that one . 
At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions , but there was one that 's really stuck with me since then . 
There was a young girl who stood up , and she asked the question : " Where should we explore ? " 
I think there 's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over , that for the next generation they 're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore . 
But is that really the case ? 
Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on Earth ? 
It sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology . 
This is an explorer of the unseen world , Martinus Beijerinck . 
So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease . 
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters . 
And he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria , at the time . 
He came up with a name for his mystery agent . 
He called it the virus -- Latin for " poison . " 
And in uncovering viruses , Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us . 
We now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet , more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined . 
And obviously there 's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradication of smallpox , the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer , which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus . 
And Beijerinck 's discovery , this was not something that occurred 500 years ago . 
It was a little over 100 years ago that Beijerinck discovered viruses . 
So basically we had automobiles , but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet . 
We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world -- things like deep sequencing , which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species , but to look at entire metagenomes , the communities of teeming microorganisms in , on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species . 
We can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between . 
In my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them . 
And just to give you a sense of how this works , imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you . 
And this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza . 
The first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information . 
And if we started looking into that genetic information , we 'd see a number of usual suspects out there -- of course , a lot of human genetic information , but also bacterial and viral information , mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose . 
But we 'd also see something very , very surprising . 
As we started to look at this information , we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose does n't match anything that we 've ever seen before -- no plant , animal , fungus , virus or bacteria . 
Basically we have no clue what this is . 
And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data , a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter . 
We know it 's not anything that we 've seen before ; it 's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information . 
And there 's a lot of it . 
If you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter , if we looked at your gut , up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter . 
And even in the relatively sterile blood , around one to two percent of this information is dark matter -- ca n't be classified , ca n't be typed or matched with anything we 've seen before . 
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact . 
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new . 
But as they become more and more accurate , we 've determined that this information is a form of life , or at least some of it is a form of life . 
And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy , there 's a very , very exciting possibility that exists : that buried in this life , in this genetic information , are signatures of as of yet unidentified life . 
That as we explore these strings of A 's , T 's , C 's and G 's , we may uncover a completely new class of life that , like Beijerinck , will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology . 
That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we are n't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology . 
I 'm pleased to announce that , along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF , we 're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life . 
A little over a hundred years ago , people were unaware of viruses , the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet . 
A hundred years from now , people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses . 
It 's true , we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there , but that does n't mean that there 's nothing left to explore on Earth . 
Beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers -- people like that young girl from Beloit , Wisconsin . 
And I think if we phrase that lesson , it 's something like this : Do n't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story . 
Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore . 
There are unknowns all around us and they 're just waiting to be discovered . 
Thank you .

Legendary scientist David Deutsch puts theoretical physics on the back burner to discuss a more urgent matter : the survival of our species . The first step toward solving global warming , he says , is to admit that we have a problem .

David Deutsch on our place in the cosmos 
We 've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising . 
So I 'll try and do that , but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows . 
And the first one , in fact , is something that has been known for most of recorded history . 
And that is that the planet Earth , or the solar system , or our environment or whatever , is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation , as it used to be thought -- and our present existence , and most important , our future survival . 
Nowadays this idea has a dramatic name : Spaceship Earth . 
And the idea there is that outside the spaceship , the universe is implacably hostile , and inside is all we have , all we depend on . 
And we only get the one chance : if we mess up our spaceship , we 've got nowhere else to go . 
Now , the second thing that everyone already knows is that contrary to what was believed for most of human history , human beings are not , in fact , the hub of existence . 
As Stephen Hawking famously said , we 're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that 's in orbit around a typical star , which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy , and so on . 
Now the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we 're at a very un - typical place , uniquely suited and so on , and the second one is saying that we 're at a typical place . 
And especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions , then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other . 
But that does n't prevent them from both being completely false . 
And they are . So let me start with the second one : Typical . Well -- is this a typical place ? Well , let 's look around , you know , and look in a random direction , and we see a wall , and chemical scum -- -- and that 's not typical of the universe at all . 
All you 've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back , and you wo n't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet . And if you go further than that , you 'll see the sun , the solar system , and the stars and so on . 
But that 's still not typical of the universe , because stars come in galaxies . 
And most places in the universe , a typical place in the universe , is nowhere near any galaxies . 
So let 's go out further , till we 're outside the galaxy , and look back , and yeah , there 's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us . 
And at this point we 've come 100,000 light years from here . 
But we 're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe . 
To get to a typical place , you 've got to go 1,000 times as far as that into intergalactic space . 
And so what does that look like ? Typical . 
What does a typical place in the universe look like ? 
Well , at enormous expense , TED has arranged a high - resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of intergalactic space -- the view from intergalactic space . 
So can we have the lights off , please , so we can see it ? 
Well , not quite , not quite perfect -- you see , in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark , pitch dark . 
It 's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you , and that star were to explode as a supernova , and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you , you still would n't be able to see even a glimmer . 
That 's how big and how dark the universe is . 
And that 's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright , so brilliant an event , that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years . 
And yet from intergalactic space , it 's so far away you would n't even see it . 
It 's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero . 
And it 's very empty . The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create . So that 's how different a typical place is from this place . 
And that is how un - typical this place is . 
So can we have the lights back on please ? Thank you . 
Now how do we know about an environment that 's so far away , and so different , and so alien , from anything we 're used to ? 
Well , the Earth -- our environment , in the form of us -- is creating knowledge . 
Well , what does that mean ? Well , look out even further than we 've just been -- I mean from here , with a telescope -- and you 'll see things that look like stars . 
They 're called " quasars . " Quasars originally meant quasi - stellar object . 
Which means things that look a bit like stars . But they 're not stars . 
And we know what they are . Billions of years ago , and billions of light years away , the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super - massive black hole . 
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse . And some of the matter , back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of -- I think it 's a trillion suns . 
Now , the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet . 
We could n't survive for an instant in it . Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets . 
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion , but at point - blank range and for millions of years at a time . 
And yet , that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later , on the other side of the universe , some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe , and model , and predict , and explain , above all -- there 's your reference -- what was happening there , in reality . 
The one physical system , the brain , contains an accurate working model of the other -- the quasar . 
Not just a superficial image of it , though it contains that as well , but an explanatory model , embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure . 
Now that is knowledge . And if that were n't amazing enough , the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time . That is the growth of knowledge . 
So , the laws of physics have this special property . 
That physical objects , as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time . 
So we are a chemical scum that is different . This chemical scum has universality . 
Its structure contains , with ever - increasing precision , the structure of everything . This place , and not other places in the universe , is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality . And so , far from being insignificant , the fact that the laws of physics allow this , or even mandate that this can happen , is one of the most important things about the physical world . 
Now how does the solar system -- and our environment , in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe ? 
Well , one thing that 's true about Stephen Hawking 's remark -- I mean , it is true , but it 's the wrong emphasis . One thing that 's true about it is that it does n't do it with any special physics . There 's no special dispensation , no miracles involved . It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance . 
One of them is matter , because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing . Information processing is computation , computation requires a computer -- there 's no known way of making a computer without matter . 
We also need energy to make the computer , and most important , to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover . 
And then thirdly , less tangible , but just as essential for the open - ended creation of knowledge , of explanations , is evidence . 
Now , our environment is inundated with evidence . 
We happen to get round to testing , let 's say , Newton 's Law of Gravity about 300 years ago . 
But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that , and will continue to fall on for billions of years afterwards . And the same is true for all the other sciences . 
As far as we know , evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet . 
Our location is saturated with evidence , and also with matter and energy . 
Out in intergalactic space , those three prerequisites for the open - ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply . 
As I said , it 's empty ; it 's cold ; and it 's dark out there . Or is it ? 
Now actually , that 's just another parochial misconception . 
Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space , the same size as our home , the solar system . Now that cube is very empty by human standards , but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter . 
And a million tons is enough to make , say , a self - contained space station , on which there 's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open - ended stream of knowledge , and so on . 
Now , it 's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on . 
But the thing is , in a comprehensible universe , if something is n't forbidden by the laws of physics , then what could possibly prevent us from doing it , other than knowing how ? 
In other words , it 's a matter of knowledge , not resources . 
And the same -- well , if we could do that we 'd automatically have an energy supply , because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence ? 
Well , again , it 's dark out there to human senses . But all you 've got to do is take a telescope , even one of present - day design , look out and you 'll see the same galaxies as we do from here . 
And with a more powerful telescope , you 'll be able to see stars , and planets . 
In those galaxies , you 'll be able to do astrophysics , and learn the laws of physics . 
And locally there you could build particle accelerators , and learn elementary particle physics , and chemistry , and so on . 
Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life - bearing planet and back . 
But I have to tell you -- and sorry , Richard -- but I never did like biology field trips much , and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years . 
So in fact , intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open - ended creation of knowledge . Any such cube , anywhere in the universe , could become the same kind of hub that we are , if the knowledge of how to do so were present there . 
So we 're not in a uniquely hospitable place . 
If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open - ended stream of explanations , then so is almost every other environment . So is the Earth . So is a polluted Earth . 
And the limiting factor , there and here , is not resources , because they 're plentiful , but knowledge , which is scarce . 
Now this cosmic knowledge - based view may -- and I think ought to -- make us feel very special . But it should also make us feel vulnerable , because it means that without the specific knowledge that 's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe , we wo n't survive them . 
All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away , and we 'll all be dead ! 
Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things , from astrophysics , to scientific experiments gone wrong , and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction . 
And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century . 
I think he 's going to talk about that later in the conference . 
Now I do n't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in . 
But I do agree with him about this . We can survive , and we can fail to survive . 
But it depends not on chance , but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time . 
The danger is not at all unprecedented . Species go extinct all the time . 
Civilizations end . The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history . 
And if we want to be the exception to that , then logically our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species , and our civilization , from all the others -- namely , our special relationship with the laws of physics , our ability to create new explanations , new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence . 
So let me now apply this to a current controversy , not because I want to advocate any particular solution , but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean . 
And the controversy is global warming . 
Now , I 'm a physicist , but I 'm not the right kind of physicist . In regard to global warming , I 'm just a layman . And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory . And according to that theory , it 's already too late to avoid a disaster . 
Because if it 's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol , with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is , then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure . 
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem , merely to postpone it by a little . So it 's already too late to avoid it , and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger . 
It was probably already too late in the 1970s , when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die . 
Now the lesson of that seems clear to me , and I do n't know why it is n't informing public debate . 
It is that we ca n't always know . When we know of an impending disaster , and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself , then there 's not going to be much argument , really . 
But no precautions , and no precautionary principle , can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee . 
Hence , we need a stance of problem - fixing , not just problem - avoidance . 
And it 's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure , but that 's only if we know what to prevent . 
If you 've been punched on the nose , then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches . 
If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only , then it would achieve very little of either . 
The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs . 
It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature , and with plans to live at the higher temperature -- and not at all costs , but efficiently and cheaply . And some such plans exist , things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away , and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide . 
At the moment , these things are fringe research . 
They 're not central to the human effort to face this problem , or problems in general . 
And with problems that we are not aware of yet , the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope , not just of solving problems , but of survival . 
So take two stone tablets , and carve on them . 
On one of them , carve : " Problems are soluble . " 
And on the other one carve : " Problems are inevitable . " 
Thank you .

How can a struggling country break out of poverty if it 's trapped in a system of bad rules ? Economist Paul Romer unveils a bold idea : " charter cities , " city - scale administrative zones governed by a coalition of nations .

Paul Romer 's radical idea : Charter cities 
Take a look at this picture . 
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us . 
These African students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they do n't have any electricity at home . 
Now , I have n't met these particular students , but I 've met students like them . 
Let 's just pick one -- for example , the one in the green shirt . 
Let 's give him a name , too : Nelson . 
I 'll bet Nelson has a cellphone . 
So here is the puzzle . 
Why is it that Nelson has access to a cutting - edge technology , like the cellphone , but does n't have access to a 100-year - old technology for generating electric light in the home ? 
Now , in a word , the answer is " rules . " 
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win - win solution that 's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like Nelson . 
What kinds of rules ? 
The electric company in this nation operates under a rule , which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low , subsidized price -- in fact , a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells . 
So it has neither the resources , nor the incentives , to hook up many other users . 
The president wanted to change this rule . 
He 's seen that it 's possible to have a different set of rules , rules where businesses earn a small profit , so they have an incentive to sign up more customers . 
That 's the kind of rules that the cellphone company that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under . 
The president has seen how those rules worked well . 
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity , but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates . 
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win - win solution help his country . 
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights . 
The real challenge then , is to try to figure out how we can change rules . 
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules ? 
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical , which is that , if we can give more choices to people , and more choices to leaders -- who , in many countries , are also people . 
But , it 's useful to present the opposition between these two . 
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader , a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity , takes away a choice that people in the economy want . 
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power . 
So if you give just to one side or the other , you 'll have tension or friction . 
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both , that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps . 
Now , Nelson also has access to the Internet . 
And he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules , the ways that rules can keep people in the dark , look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night . 
In particular check out Asia . 
If you zoom in here , you can see North Korea , in outline here , which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors . 
Now , you wo n't be surprised to learn that the rules in North Korea keep people there in the dark . 
But it is important to recognize that North Korea and South Korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations , but also in the deeper senses of understandings , norms , culture , values and beliefs . 
When they separated , they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules . 
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other , for better , or for worse . 
Now let 's look at another region , the Caribbean . 
Zoom in on Haiti , in outline here . 
Haiti is also dark , compared to its neighbor here , the Dominican Republic , which has about the same number of residents . 
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico , which has half as many residents as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic . 
What Haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak . 
It 's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive , as in North Korea . 
So that if we want to create environments with good rules , we ca n't just tear down . 
We 've got to find ways to build up , as well . 
Now , China dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules . 
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart , China was the world 's high - technology leader . 
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel , printing , gunpowder . 
But the Chinese never adopted , at least in that period , effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas -- a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread . 
And they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut China off from the rest of the world . 
So as other countries in the world innovated , in the sense both of developing newer technologies , but also developing newer rules , the Chinese were cut off from those advances . 
Income there stayed stagnant , as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world . 
This next chart looks at more recent data . 
It plots income , average income in China as a percentage of average income in the United States . 
In the ' 50s and ' 60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent . 
But then in the late ' 70s something changed . 
Growth took off in China . The Chinese started catching up very quickly with the United States . 
If you go back to the map at night , you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China . 
The brightest spot in China , which you can see on the edge of the outline here , is Hong Kong . 
Hong Kong was a small bit of China that , for most of the 20th century , operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland China -- rules that were copied from working market economies of the time , and administered by the British . 
In the 1950s , Hong Kong was a place where millions of people could go , from the mainland , to start in jobs like sewing shirts , making toys . 
But , to get on a process of increasing income , increasing skills led to very rapid growth there . 
Hong Kong was also the model which leaders like Deng Xiaoping could copy , when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model . 
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people . 
So instead of forcing everyone in China to shift immediately to the market model , they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do , in a sense , what Britain did : make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there . 
So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong : zones where Chinese could come and work , and cities grew up very rapidly there ; also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things . 
One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen . 
In that city there is a Taiwanese firm that made the iPhone that many of you have , and they made it with labor from Chinese who moved there to Shenzhen . 
So after the four special zones , there were 14 coastal cites that were open in the same sense , and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to , that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered . 
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy . 
Now the Chinese example shows us several points . 
One is : preserve choices for people . 
Two : operate on the right scale . 
If you try to change the rules in a village , you could do that , but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules . 
On the other hand , the nation is too big . 
If you try to change the rules in the nation , you ca n't give some people a chance to hold back , see how things turn out , and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules . 
But cities give you this opportunity to create new places , with new rules that people can opt in to . 
And they 're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules . 
So the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city . 
We start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we 'll need to build the city . 
We 'll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure -- the power system , the roads , the port , the airport , the buildings . 
You 'll need to attract firms , who will come hire the people who move there first . 
And you 'll need to attract families , the residents who will come and live there permanently , raise their children , get an education for their children , and get their first job . 
With that charter , people will move there . 
The city can be built . 
And we can scale this model . 
We can go do it over and over again . 
To make it work , we need good rules . We 've already discussed that . 
Those are captured in the charter . 
We also need the choices for people . 
That 's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land . 
You start from uninhabited territory . 
People can come live under the new charter , but no one is forced to live under it . 
The final thing we need are choices for leaders . 
And , to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations : cases where nations work together , in effect , de facto , the way China and Britain worked together to build , first a little enclave of the market model , and then scale it throughout China . 
In a sense , Britain , inadvertently , through its actions in Hong Kong , did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we 've undertaken in the last century . 
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again , we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world . 
In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility , a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities . 
Now , when I say that , some of you are starting to think , " Well , is this just bringing back colonialism ? " 
It 's not . But it 's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things , can get in the way , can make us pull back , can shut down our ability , and our interest in trying to explore new ideas . 
Why is this not like colonialism ? 
The thing that was bad about colonialism , and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs , is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension . 
This model is all about choices , both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places . 
And , choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension . 
So let 's talk about how this could play out in practice . 
Let 's take a particular leader , Raul Castro , who is the leader of Cuba . 
It must have occurred to Castro that he has the chance to do for Cuba what Deng Xiaoping did for China , but he does n't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba . 
He does , though , have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status . 
There is a zone there , around Guantanamo Bay , where a treaty gives the United States administrative responsibility for a piece of land that 's about twice the size of Manhattan . 
Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada and says , " Look , the Yankees have a terrible PR problem . 
They want to get out . 
Why do n't you , Canada , take over ? 
Build -- run a special administrative zone . 
Allow a new city to be built up there . 
Allow many people to come in . 
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby . 
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well . 
Others will hold back . But this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country . " 
Now , where else might this model be tried ? 
Well , Africa . I 've talked with leaders in Africa . 
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule . 
It 's a rule for changing rules . 
It 's a way to create new rules , and let people opt - in without coercion , and the opposition that coercion can force . 
They also totally get the idea that in some instances they can make more credible promises to long - term investors -- the kind of investors who will come build the port , build the roads , in a new city -- they can make more credible promises if they do it along with a partner nation . 
Perhaps even in some arrangement that 's a little bit like an escrow account , where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it . 
There is also lots of land in Africa where new cities could be built . 
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast . 
There are immense stretches of land like this -- land where hundreds of millions of people could live . 
Now , if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites , but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions , perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them ? 
Well , throughout the world , if we look at the lights at night , the one thing that 's misleading is that , visually , it looks like most of the world is already built out . 
So let me show you why that 's wrong . 
Take this representation of all of the land . 
Turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on Earth . 
And let these dots represent the land that 's already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in . 
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth . 
So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people , they would be dots like this . 
We 'd go from three percent of the arable land , to four percent . 
We 'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth by building more cities that people can move to . 
And if these are cities governed by good rules , they can be cities where people are safe from crime , safe from disease and bad sanitation , where people have a chance to get a job . 
They can get basic utilities like electricity . 
Their kids can get an education . 
So what will it take to get started building the first charter cities , scaling this so we build many more ? 
It would help to have a manual . 
What university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual . 
You would n't want to let us run the cities , go out and design them . 
You would n't let academics out in the wild . 
But , you could set us to work thinking about questions like , suppose it is n't just Canada that does the deal with Raul Castro . 
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant , and Spain as well . And perhaps Cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four - way joint venture . 
How would we write the treaty to do that ? 
There is less precedent for that , but that could easily be worked out . 
How would we finance this ? 
Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started . 
You could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police , the courts , but the school system and the health care system too , which make this a more attractive place to live , makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which , incidentally , makes the land more valuable . 
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it , and set up the basic rules , go very much in the right direction . 
So there are many other details like this . 
How could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job , assembling something like an iPhone , but make those buildings energy efficient , and make sure that they are safe , so they do n't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane . 
Many technical details to be worked out , but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock , there 's no impediment , other than a failure of imagination , that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win - win solution . 
Let me conclude with this picture . 
The reason we can be so well off , even though there is so many people on earth , is because of the power of ideas . 
We can share ideas with other people , and when they discover them , they share with us . 
It 's not like scarce objects , where sharing means we each get less . 
When we share ideas we all get more . 
When we think about ideas in that way , we usually think about technologies . 
But there is another class of ideas : the rules that govern how we interact with each other ; rules like , let 's have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free . 
Let 's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office , that people can pledge as collateral . 
If we can keep innovating on our space of rules , and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules , so we do n't get stuck with bad rules , then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place , so that people like Nelson and his friends do n't have to study any longer under the streetlights . Thank you .

Craig Venter on DNA and the sea 
At the break , I was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate . 
And this will be my only comment on it . 
And that is , I understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists . 
What I 'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we 're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves . 
It 's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free - living organism , that of haemophilus influenzae . 
That took a genome project from 13 years down to four months . 
We can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours . 
So in the last decade , a large number of genomes have been added : most human pathogens , a couple of plants , several insects and several mammals , including the human genome . 
Genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was , by the end of this year , we might have between three and five genomes sequenced ; it 's on the order of several hundred . 
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year , as a side project from environmental organisms . 
So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed . 
But as we look , what 's out there , we 've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet . 
Most people do n't realize it , because they 're invisible , but microbes make up about a half of the Earth 's biomass , whereas all animals only make up about one one - thousandth of all the biomass . 
And maybe it 's something that people in Oxford do n't do very often , but if you ever make it to the sea , and you swallow a mouthful of seawater , keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses . 
Less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago , and so we decided to do something about it . 
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition , where we were , as with great oceanographic expeditions , trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles . 
We started in Bermuda for our test project , then moved up to Halifax , working down the U.S. East Coast , the Caribbean Sea , the Panama Canal , through to the Galapagos , then across the Pacific , and we 're in the process now of working our way across the Indian Ocean . 
It 's very tough duty ; we 're doing this on a sailing vessel , in part to help excite young people about going into science . 
The experiments are incredibly simple . 
We just take seawater and we filter it , and we collect different size organisms on different filters , and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville , where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours . 
And with doing this , we 've made some amazing discoveries . 
For example , it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments . 
It turns out , almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors , and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication . 
From one site , from one barrel of seawater , we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species . 
We 've extended this to the air now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation . 
We 're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day , particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums . 
We filter through some simple apparatuses ; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in New York City . 
And we 're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time . 
Just on the data collection side , just where we are through the Galapagos , we 're finding that almost every 200 miles , we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean . 
Some of these make logical sense , in terms of different temperature gradients . 
So this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm , blue being cold -- and we found there 's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples , in terms of abundant species . 
The other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light , and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence . 
And these vary tremendously from region to region . 
Maybe not surprisingly , in the deep ocean , where it 's mostly blue , the photoreceptors tend to see blue light . 
When there 's a lot of chlorophyll around , they see a lot of green light . 
But they vary even more , possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes . 
Just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was , we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition , which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes . 
And we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are : Are we just discovering new members of known families , or are we discovering new families ? 
And it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families , but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families . 
So we 're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes , components and life on this planet . 
When we look at the so - called evolutionary tree , we 're up on the upper right - hand corner with the animals . 
Of those roughly 29 million genes , we only have around 24,000 in our genome . 
And if you take all animals together , we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families . 
I view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution . 
And we think in a gene - centric view -- maybe going back to Richard Dawkins ' ideas -- than in a genome - centric view , which are different constructs of these gene components . 
Synthetic DNA , the ability to synthesize DNA , has changed at sort of the same pace that DNA sequencing has over the last decade or two , and is getting very rapid and very cheap . 
Our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995 , and that from mycoplasma genitalium . 
And we have really nice T - shirts that say , you know , " I heart my genitalium . " 
This is actually just a microorganism . 
But it has roughly 500 genes . 
Haemophilus had 1,800 genes . 
And we simply asked the question , if one species needs 800 , another 500 , is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system ? 
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis . 
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA that randomly insert in the genetic code . 
And if they insert in the middle of the gene , they disrupt its function . 
So we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those " non - essential genes . " 
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this , and you can only define an essential or non - essential gene based on exactly what 's in the environment . 
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms , and we tried to compare all of those , to see what they had in common . 
And we got these overlapping circles . And we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms . 
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite ; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so . 
So we think that we can expand or contract genomes , depending on your point of view here , to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500 . 
The only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them , and we had to do this in a cassette - based fashion . 
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA in large pieces was extremely difficult . 
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison , my colleagues on this , developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two - week period that was 100 percent accurate , in terms of its sequence and its biology . 
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA , injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden , that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria . 
This was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten - thousandth as active and it took three years to do . 
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174 . 
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware , and that 's the notions that we have with biology . 
People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare , and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee , and a special committee the U.S. government has set up to review this area . 
And I think it 's important to keep reality in mind , versus what happens with people 's imaginations . 
Basically , any virus that 's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made . 
And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox , but the DNA from this organism is not infective . 
So even if somebody made the smallpox genome , that DNA itself would not cause infections . 
The real concern that security departments have is designer viruses . 
And there 's only two countries , the U.S. and the former Soviet Union , that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents . 
If that research is truly discontinued , there should be very little activity on the know - how to make designer viruses in the future . 
I think single - cell organisms are possible within two years . 
And possibly eukaryotic cells , those that we have , are possible within a decade . 
So we 're now making several dozen different constructs , because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome . 
The key is , how do you put all of the others ? 
We start with these fragments , and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome . 
This is derived from an organism , deinococcus radiodurans , that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed . 
It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours , after its chromosomes are literally blown apart . 
This organism is ubiquitous on the planet , and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there . 
This is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation . 
The glass started to burn and crack , while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier . 
Here 's an actual picture of what happens : the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation . 
The chromosome is literally blown apart . 
And here 's that same DNA automatically reassembled 24 hours later . 
It 's truly stunning that these organisms can do that , and we probably have thousands , if not tens of thousands , of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that . 
After these genomes are synthesized , the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome . 
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential , not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues . 
For example , from the third organism we sequenced , Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures ; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment . 
So we know lots of different pathways , thousands of different organisms now that live off of CO2 , and can capture that back . 
So instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes , we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere , converting that into biopolymers or other products . 
We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide , and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen . 
Also , there 's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane . 
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products . 
Within a short while , I think there 's going to be a new field called " Combinatorial Genomics , " because with these new synthesis capabilities , these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination , we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day . 
And therefore , as with all biology , you get selection through screening , whether you 're screening for hydrogen production , or chemical production , or just viability . 
To understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach . 
We 're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight . 
Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen , and we have an oxygen - insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process . 
We 're also combining cellulases , the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol . 
Pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes . 
The chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce . 
I think future engineered species could be the source of food , hopefully a source of energy , environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry . 
Let me just close with ethical and policy studies . 
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year - and - a - half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species . 
Every major religion participated in this . 
It was actually a very strange study , because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books , and they could n't find anything in them prohibiting making life , so it must be OK . The only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this , but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them . 
Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded a multi - institutional study on this , to work out what the risk and benefits to society are , and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area , and we 're trying to set good examples as we go forward . 
These are complex issues . 
Except for the threat of bio - terrorism , they 're very simple issues in terms of , can we design things to produce clean energy , perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes . 
Thank you very much .

Psychologist Philip Zimbardo says happiness and success are rooted in a trait most of us disregard : the way we orient toward the past , present and future . He suggests we calibrate our outlook on time as a first step to improving our lives .

Philip Zimbardo prescribes a healthy take on time 
I want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time , in a very short time . 
Video : All right , start the clock please . 30 seconds studio . 
Keep it quiet please . Settle down . 
It 's about time . End sequence . Take one . 
15 seconds studio . 
10 , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two ... 
Philip Zimbardo : Let 's tune into the conversation of the principals in Adam 's temptation . 
" Come on Adam , do n't be so wishy - washy . Take a bite . " " I did . " 
" One bite , Adam . Do n't abandon Eve . " 
" I do n't know , guys . 
I do n't want to get in trouble . " 
" Okay . One bite . What the hell ? " 
Life is temptation . It 's all about yielding , resisting , yes , no , now , later , impulsive , reflective , present focus and future focus . 
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment . 
Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage -- thank you George Bush -- the majority , 60 percent , yielded to sexual temptations within one year . 
And most of them did so without using birth control . 
So much for promises . 
Now lets tempt four - year - olds , giving them a treat . 
They can have one marshmallow now . But if they wait until the experimenter comes back , they can have two . 
Of course it pays , if you like marshmallows , to wait . 
What happens is two - thirds of the kids give in to temptation . 
They can not wait . The others , of course , wait . 
They resist the temptation . They delay the now for later . 
Walter Mischel , my colleague at Stanford , went back 14 years later , to try to discover what was different about those kids . 
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded , in many ways . 
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT . 
That 's enormous . That 's like a whole set of different IQ points . 
They did n't get in as much trouble . They were better students . 
They were self - confident and determined . And the key for me today , the key for you , is , they were future - focused rather than present - focused . 
So what is time perspective ? That 's what I 'm going to talk about today . 
Time perspective is the study of how individuals , all of us , divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories . 
And you do it automatically and non - consciously . 
They vary between cultures , between nations , between individuals , between social classes , between education levels . 
And the problem is that they can become biased , because you learn to over - use some of them and under - use the others . 
What determines any decision you make ? 
You make a decision on which you 're going to base an action . 
For some people it 's only about what is in the immediate situation , what other people are doing and what you 're feeling . 
And those people , when they make their decisions in that format -- we 're going to call them " present - oriented , " because their focus is what is now . 
For others , the present is irrelevant . 
It 's always about " What is this situation like that I 've experienced in the past ? " 
So that their decisions are based on past memories . 
And we 're going to call those people " past - oriented , " because they focus on what was . 
For others it 's not the past , it 's not the present , it 's only about the future . 
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences . 
Cost - benefit analysis . 
We 're going to call them " future - oriented . " Their focus is on what will be . 
So , time paradox , I want to argue , the paradox of time perspective , is something that influences every decision you make , you 're totally unaware of . 
Namely , the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives . 
Well there is actually six of them . There are two ways to be present - oriented . 
There is two ways to be past - oriented , two ways to be future . 
You can focus on past - positive , or past - negative . 
You can be present - hedonistic , namely you focus on the joys of life , or present - fatalist -- it does n't matter , your life is controlled . 
You can be future - oriented , setting goals . 
Or you can be transcendental future : namely , life begins after death . 
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation , that 's what you 've got to learn to do . 
So , very quickly , what is the optimal time profile ? 
High on past - positive . Moderately high on future . 
And moderate on present - hedonism . 
And always low on past - negative and present - fatalism . 
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past - positive gives you roots . You connect your family , identity and your self . 
What you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations , new challenges . 
What you get from the present hedonism is the energy , the energy to explore yourself , places , people , sensuality . 
Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives . 
What do futures sacrifice for success ? 
They sacrifice family time . They sacrifice friend time . 
They sacrifice fun time . They sacrifice personal indulgence . 
They sacrifice hobbies . And they sacrifice sleep . So it affects their health . 
And they live for work , achievement and control . 
I 'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters . 
And it resonated for me . I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto , a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present . 
I 'm here as a future - oriented person who went over the top , who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened , and made me future oriented . 
Told me do n't eat that marshmallow , because if you wait you 're going to get two of them , until I learned to balance out . 
I 've added present - hedonism , I 've added a focus on the past - positive , so , at 76 years old , I am more energetic than ever , more productive , and I 'm happier than I have ever been . 
I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems : changing the drop - out rates of school kids , combating addictions , enhancing teen health , curing vets ' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation , reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate , altering appeals to suicidal terrorists , and modifying family conflicts as time - zone clashes . 
So I want to end by saying : many of life 's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others . 
And the idea is so simple , so obvious , but I think the consequences are really profound . 
Thank you so much .

How many of today 's headlines will matter in 100 years ? 1000 ? Kirk Citron 's " Long News " project collects stories that not only matter today , but will resonate for decades -- even centuries -- to come . At TED2010 , he highlights recent headlines with the potential to shape our future . 
future , global issues , media , news , science

Kirk Citron : And now , the real news 
We are drowning in news . 
Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year . 
That 's just one source . 
My question is : How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run ? 
That 's the idea behind The Long News . 
It 's a project by The Long Now Foundation , which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand . 
And what we 're looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now . 
And when you look at the news through that filter , a lot falls by the wayside . 
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year , is this going to matter in a decade ? 
Or this ? 
Or this ? 
Really ? 
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ? 
Okay , that was kind of cool . 
But the top story of this past year was the economy , and I 'm just betting that , sooner or later , this particular recession is going to be old news . 
So , what kind of stories might make a difference for the future ? 
Well , let 's take science . 
Someday , little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things . 
That someday is already here if you 're a mouse . 
Some recent stories : nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom ; they 're sending genes into the brain ; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body . 
What about resources ? How are we going to feed nine billion people ? 
We 're having trouble feeding six billion today . 
As we heard yesterday , there 's over a billion people hungry . 
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops . 
Bill Gates , fortunately , has bet a billion on [ agricultural ] research . 
What about global politics ? 
The world 's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda , and they may . 
They 've overtaken the U.S. as the world 's biggest car market , they 've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter , and they 've started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers . 
We 're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know . 
Some recent discoveries : There 's an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica ; there 's a self - directed robot scientist that 's made a discovery -- soon , science may no longer need us , and life may no longer need us either ; a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years . 
It seems that with or without us , life will go on . 
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this one : water found on the moon . 
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there . 
And if NASA does n't do it , China might , or somebody in this room might write a big check . 
My point is this : In the long run , some news stories are more important than others .

Carolyn Porco flies us to Saturn 
In the next 18 minutes , I 'm going to take you on a journey . 
And it 's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now , and it began some 50 years ago , when humans first stepped off our planet . 
And in those 50 years , not only did we literally , physically set foot on the moon , but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids , we have rendezvoused with comets , and , at this point in time , we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto , the body formerly known as a planet . 
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey : a voyage to understand something , to get a sense of our cosmic place , to understand something of our origins , and how Earth , our planet , and we , living on it , came to be . 
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this , there 's Saturn . And we have been to Saturn before -- we visited Saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in - depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft , traveling across interplanetary space for seven years , glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004 , and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun . 
Now , the Saturn system is a rich planetary system . 
It offers mystery , scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare , and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach . 
In fact , just studying the rings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies . 
And here 's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula , which is our closest , largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way . 
And then , here 's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy , taken by the Hubble Space Telescope . 
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us , and also how humans fit into that picture . 
And it pains me that I ca n't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini . 
I ca n't show you all the beautiful pictures that we 've taken in the last two and a half years , because I simply do n't have the time . 
So I 'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn , and have been for the past two and a half years . 
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons . 
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S. 
Most of the beautiful pictures we 've taken of Saturn , in fact , show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons . Here 's Saturn with Dione , and then , here 's Saturn showing the rings edge - on , showing you just how vertically thin they are , with the moon Enceladus . 
Now , two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts . 
And those are Titan and Enceladus . Titan is Saturn 's largest moon , and , until Cassini had arrived there , was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system . 
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who 've watched the planets . 
It has a very large , thick atmosphere , and in fact , its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth , or at least had in the past , than any other body in the solar system . 
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen , like you are breathing here in this room , except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane . 
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down , and their products join together to make haze particles . 
This haze is ubiquitous . It 's completely global and enveloping Titan . 
And that 's why you can not see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum . 
But these haze particles , it was surmised , before we got there with Cassini , over billions and billions of years , gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge . 
So like the equivalent , the Titan equivalent , of tar , or oil , or what -- we did n't know what . 
But this is what we suspected . And these molecules , especially methane and ethane , can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan . 
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth . 
It 's a condensable in the atmosphere , and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities . You can have methane clouds , OK , and above those clouds , you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze , which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface . 
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit . 
But despite that cold , you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan . 
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth : it carves gullies ; it forms rivers and cataracts ; it can create canyons ; it can pool in large basins and craters . 
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills , down into the lowlands . So stop and think for a minute . 
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like . 
It 's dark . High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth . 
It 's cold , it 's eerie , it 's misty , it might be raining , and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner . 
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini , and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan , though it is not the same in detail , is every bit as fascinating as that story is . 
And for us , it has been like -- the Cassini people -- it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true . 
As I said , it has a thick , extensive atmosphere . 
This is a picture of Titan , backlit by the Sun , with the rings as a beautiful backdrop . 
And yet another moon there -- I do n't even know which one it is . It 's a very extensive atmosphere . 
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere , and my camera system is one of them . 
And we have taken pictures like this . 
And what you see is bright and dark regions , and that 's about as far as it got for us . 
It was so mystifying : we could n't make out what we were seeing on Titan . 
When you look closer at this region , you start to see things like sinuous channels -- we did n't know . You see a few round things . 
This , we later found out , is , in fact , a crater , but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan , meaning it 's a very young surface . 
And there are features that look tectonic . 
They look like they 've been pulled apart . 
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet , it means there 's been a fracture , like a fault . 
And so it 's been tectonically altered . 
But we could n't make sense of our images , until , six months after we got into orbit , an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini 's investigation of Titan . 
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe , the European - built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system . We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan , it took two and a half hours to descend , and it landed on the surface . 
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is . 
This is a device of human making , and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history . 
It is so significant that , in my mind , this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe , and sadly , that was n't the case . 
. 
It was significant for another reason . This is an international mission , and this event was celebrated in Europe , in Germany , and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents , and American accents , and German accents , and French and Italian and Dutch accents . 
It was a moving demonstration of what the words " united nations " are supposed to mean : a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good . 
And , in this case , it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet , and to come to understand a planetary system that , for all of human history , had been unreachable , and now humans had actually touched it . 
So it was -- I mean , I 'm getting goose bumps just talking about it . 
It was a tremendously emotional event , and it 's something that I will personally never forget , and you should n't either . 
. 
But anyway , the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down , and it also took panoramic pictures . 
And I ca n't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan 's surface from the probe . And this is what we saw . 
And it was a shocker , because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be . 
It was an unambiguous pattern , a geological pattern . 
It 's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids . 
And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge . 
And they converge into this channel here , which drains into this region . 
You are looking at a shoreline . 
Was this a shoreline of fluids ? We did n't know . 
But this is somewhat of a shoreline . 
This picture is taken at 16 kilometers . 
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers , OK ? Again , the shoreline . 
Okay , now , 16 kilometers , eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude . 
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S. , you would be flying at these altitudes . 
So , this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan . 
And then finally , the probe came to rest on the surface , and I 'm going to show you , ladies and gentlemen , the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system . 
And here is the horizon , OK ? 
These are probably water ice pebbles , yes ? 
. 
And obviously , it landed in one of these flat , dark regions and it did n't sink out of sight . So it was n't fluid that we landed in . 
What the probe came down in was basically the Titan equivalent of a mud flat . 
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane . 
And it 's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw , and has drained over billions of years to fill in low - lying basins . 
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in . 
But still , there was no sign in our images , or even in the Huygens ' images , of any large , open bodies of fluids . 
Where were they ? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes . 
OK , so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan , showing these dunes . These are dunes that are 100 meters tall , separated by a few kilometers , and they go on for miles and miles and miles . 
There 's hundreds , up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes . 
This is the Saharan desert of Titan . 
It 's obviously a place which is very dry , or you would n't get dunes . 
So again , it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid , until finally , we saw lakes in the polar regions . 
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan . 
It 's about the size of Lake Ontario . 
And then , only a week and a half ago , we flew over the north pole of Titan and found , again , we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea . 
So it seems that the liquids , for some reason we do n't understand , or during at least this season , are apparently at the poles of Titan . 
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable , mystical place . It 's exotic , it 's alien , but yet strangely Earth - like , and having Earth - like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity , and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself . 
And so now we go onto Enceladus . Enceladus is a small moon , it 's about a tenth the size of Titan . And you can see it here next to England , just to show you the size . This is not meant to be a threat . 
. 
And Enceladus is very white , it 's very bright , and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures . 
It is a very geologically active body . 
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus was found at the south pole -- and we 're looking at the south pole here -- where we found this system of fractures . 
And they 're a different color because they 're a different composition . 
They are coated . These fractures are coated with organic materials . 
Moreover , this whole , entire region , the south polar region , has elevated temperatures . It 's the hottest place on the planet , on the body . 
That 's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics . 
And then , when we took additional pictures , we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine , icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space . 
And when we color - code this image , to bring out the faint light levels , we see that these jets feed a plume that , in fact , we see , in other images , goes thousands of miles into the space above Enceladus . 
My team and I have examined images like this , and like this one , and have thought about the other results from Cassini . 
And we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus . 
So we have , possibly , liquid water , organic materials and excess heat . 
In other words , we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration , or in other words , an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms . 
And I do n't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system , whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere , would have enormous cultural and scientific implications . 
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once , but twice , independently , in our solar system , then that means , by inference , it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history . 
Right now , Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life . 
It is precious , it is unique , it is still , so far , the only home we 've ever known . 
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we 'd forgive you , if you were n't , OK -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968 . 
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space , and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe , and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet . 
Well , we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first , a picture that no human eye has ever seen before . 
It is a total eclipse of the Sun , seen from the other side of Saturn . 
And in this impossibly beautiful picture , you see the main rings backlit by the Sun , you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created , in fact , by the exhalations of Enceladus . 
But as if that were n't brilliant enough , we can spot , in this beautiful image , sight of our own planet , cradled in the arms of Saturn 's rings . 
Now , there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar , and capturing the sight of our little , blue - ocean planet in the skies of other worlds . 
And that , and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that , may be , in the end , the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago . 
And thank you very much .

As of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped . This slows the delivery of aid after a disaster -- and hides the economic potential of unused lands and unknown roads . In this short talk , Google 's Lalitesh Katragadda demos Map Maker , a group map - making tool that people around the globe are using to map their world .

Lalitesh Katragadda : Making maps to fight disaster , build economies 
In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar . 
Millions of people were in severe need of help . 
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area . 
But there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cyclone victims . 
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo - codable level of detail . 
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world 's populous faces : not having detailed maps . 
But help was coming . 
At Google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads , 3,000 hospitals , logistics and relief points . 
And it took them four days . 
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker . 
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally . 
People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers , from schools to local businesses , and video stores to the corner store . 
Maps matter . 
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land . 
For example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone . 
In the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable . 
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere . 
Let 's look at some of the maps being created by users right now . 
So , as we speak , people are mapping the world in these 170 countries . 
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal . 
And , closer to home , Chalua , an N.G. road in Bangalore . 
This is the result of computational geometry , gesture recognition , and machine learning . 
This is a victory of thousands of users , in hundreds of cities , one user , one edit at a time . 
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet . 
Welcome to the new world .

In 2003 , the Palestinian village of Budrus mounted a 10-month - long nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive groves . Did you hear about it ? Did n't think so . Brazilian filmmaker Julia Bacha asks why we only pay attention to violence in the Israel - Palestine conflict -- and not to the nonviolent leaders who may one day bring peace .

Julia Bacha : Pay attention to nonviolence 
I 'm a filmmaker . 
For the last 8 years , I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means . 
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States , one question always comes up : Where is the Palestinian Gandhi ? 
Why are n't Palestinians using nonviolent resistance ? 
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers . 
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region . 
Yet , most of you have probably never heard about them . 
This divide between what 's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we do n't have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful . 
So I 'm here today to talk about the power of attention , the power of your attention , and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank , Gaza and elsewhere -- but today , my case study is going to be Palestine . 
I believe that what 's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence , but for us to start paying attention to those who already are . 
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus . 
About seven years ago , they faced extinction , because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier , and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village . 
They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded , so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank . 
Through inspired local leadership , they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening . 
Let me show you some brief clips , so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground . 
Palestinian Woman : We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel . 
Here in Budrus , we realized the wall would steal our land . 
Israeli Man : The fence has , in fact , created a solution to terror . 
Man : Today you 're invited to a peaceful march . 
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters . 
Israeli Activist : Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition . 
Woman : We saw the men trying to push the soldiers , but none of them could do that . 
But I think the girls could do it . 
Fatah Party Member : We must empty our minds of traditional thinking . 
Hamas Party Member : We were in complete harmony , and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine . 
Chanting : One united nation . 
Fatah , Hamas and the Popular Front ! 
News Anchor : The clashes over the fence continue . 
Reporter : Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd . 
They were allowed to use any force necessary . 
Man : These are live bullets . 
It 's like Fallujah . Shooting everywhere . 
Israeli Activist : I was sure we were all going to die . 
But there were others around me who were n't even cowering . 
Israeli Soldier : A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [ unclear ] . 
Protester : This is a peaceful march . 
There is no need to use violence . 
Chanting : We can do it ! We can do it ! 
We can do it ! 
Julia Bacha : When I first heard about the story of Budrus , I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago , in 2003 . 
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful . 
The residents , after 10 months of peaceful resistance , convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line , which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories . 
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem . 
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories . 
This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow , or even survive , in Palestine . 
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common ; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause . 
If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front - page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue , it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight . 
The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room . 
The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit . 
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior , since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it . 
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children . 
But that 's true for adults too . 
In fact , the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced , depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention . 
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today . 
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank , in Gaza and in East Jerusalem , I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation . 
In a village called Wallajeh , which sits very close to Jerusalem , the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus . 
They were going to be surrounded , lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access , either to the West Bank or Jerusalem . 
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention . 
So we organized a screening . 
A week later , they held the most well - attended and disciplined demonstration to date . 
The organizers say that the villagers , upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film , felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing , that people cared . 
So they kept on going . 
On the Israeli side , there is a new peace movement called Solidariot , which means solidarity in Hebrew . 
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools . 
They report that Israelis who had never been active before , upon seeing the film , understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities . 
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small - budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior . 
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil'in , Ni'lin , Wallajeh , in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible , valued and effective in their work . 
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we do n't pay attention to these efforts , they are invisible , and it 's as if they never happened . 
But I have seen first hand that if we do , they will multiply . 
If they multiply , their influence will grow in the overall Israeli - Palestinian conflict . 
And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation . 
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus . 
Let 's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere . 
Thank you .

Simon Sinek has a simple but powerful model for inspirational leadership all starting with a golden circle and the question " Why ? " His examples include Apple , Martin Luther King , and the Wright brothers ... 
bullseye , business , entrepreneur , leadership , sales , selling , success

Simon Sinek : How great leaders inspire action 
How do you explain when things do n't go as we assume ? 
Or better , how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions ? 
For example : Why is Apple so innovative ? 
Year after year , after year , after year , they 're more innovative than all their competition . 
And yet , they 're just a computer company . 
They 're just like everyone else . 
They have the same access to the same talent , the same agencies , the same consultants , the same media . 
Then why is it that they seem to have something different ? 
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement ? 
He was n't the only man who suffered in a pre - civil rights America , and he certainly was n't the only great orator of the day . 
Why him ? 
And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled , powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified , better funded ... 
and they did n't achieve powered man flight , and the Wright brothers beat them to it . 
There 's something else at play here . 
About three and a half years ago I made a discovery . 
And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it . 
As it turns out , there 's a pattern . 
As it turns out , all the great and inspiring leaders and organizations in the world -- whether it 's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers -- they all think , act and communicate the exact same way . 
And it 's the complete opposite to everyone else . 
All I did was codify it , and it 's probably the world 's simplest idea . 
I call it the golden circle . 
Why ? How ? What ? 
This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others are n't . 
Let me define the terms really quickly . 
Every single person , every single organization on the planet knows what they do , 100 percent . 
Some know how they do it , whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP . 
But very , very few people or organizations know why they do what they do . 
And by " why " I do n't mean " to make a profit . " 
That 's a result . It 's always a result . 
By " why , " I mean : What 's your purpose ? 
What 's your cause ? What 's your belief ? 
Why does your organization exist ? 
Why do you get out of bed in the morning ? 
And why should anyone care ? 
Well , as a result , the way we think , the way we act , the way we communicate is from the outside in . 
It 's obvious . We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing . 
But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size , regardless of their industry -- all think , act and communicate from the inside out . 
Let me give you an example . 
I use Apple because they 're easy to understand and everybody gets it . 
If Apple were like everyone else , a marketing message from them might sound like this : " We make great computers . 
They 're beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly . 
Want to buy one ? " " Meh . " 
And that 's how most of us communicate . 
That 's how most marketing is done , that 's how most sales is done and that 's how most of us communicate interpersonally . 
We say what we do , we say how we 're different or how we 're better and we expect some sort of a behavior , a purchase , a vote , something like that . 
Here 's our new law firm : We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients , we always perform for our clients who do business with us . 
Here 's our new car : It gets great gas mileage , it has leather seats , buy our car . 
But it 's uninspiring . 
Here 's how Apple actually communicates . 
" Everything we do , we believe in challenging the status quo . 
We believe in thinking differently . 
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly . 
We just happen to make great computers . 
Want to buy one ? " 
Totally different right ? You 're ready to buy a computer from me . 
All I did was reverse the order of the information . 
What it proves to us is that people do n't buy what you do ; people buy why you do it . 
People do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it . 
This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple . 
But we 're also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple , or a phone from Apple , or a DVR from Apple . 
But , as I said before , Apple 's just a computer company . 
There 's nothing that distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors . 
Their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products . 
In fact , they tried . 
A few years ago , Gateway came out with flat screen TVs . 
They 're eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs . 
They 've been making flat screen monitors for years . 
Nobody bought one . 
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs , and they make great quality products , and they can make perfectly well - designed products -- and nobody bought one . 
In fact , talking about it now , we ca n't even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell . 
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company ? 
But we do it every day . 
People do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it . 
The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have . 
The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe . 
Here 's the best part : None of what I 'm telling you is my opinion . 
It 's all grounded in the tenets of biology . 
Not psychology , biology . 
If you look at a cross - section of the human brain , looking from the top down , what you see is the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle . 
Our newest brain , our Homo sapien brain , our neocortex , corresponds with the " what " level . 
The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language . 
The middle two sections make up our limbic brains , and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings , like trust and loyalty . 
It 's also responsible for all human behavior , all decision - making , and it has no capacity for language . 
In other words , when we communicate from the outside in , yes , people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures . 
It just does n't drive behavior . 
When we can communicate from the inside out , we 're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior , and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do . 
This is where gut decisions come from . 
You know , sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures , and they say , " I know what all the facts and details say , but it just does n't feel right . " 
Why would we use that verb , it does n't " feel " right ? 
Because the part of the brain that controls decision - making does n't control language . 
And the best we can muster up is , " I do n't know . It just does n't feel right . " 
Or sometimes you say you 're leading with your heart , or you 're leading with your soul . 
Well , I hate to break it to you , those are n't other body parts controlling your behavior . 
It 's all happening here in your limbic brain , the part of the brain that controls decision - making and not language . 
But if you do n't know why you do what you do , and people respond to why you do what you do , then how will you ever get people to vote for you , or buy something from you , or , more importantly , be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do . 
Again , the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have ; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe . 
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job ; it 's to hire people who believe what you believe . 
I always say that , you know , if you hire people just because they can do a job , they 'll work for your money , but if you hire people who believe what you believe , they 'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears . 
And nowhere else is there a better example of this than with the Wright brothers . 
Most people do n't know about Samuel Pierpont Langley . 
And back in the early 20th century , the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day . 
Everybody was trying it . 
And Samuel Pierpont Langley had , what we assume , to be the recipe for success . 
I mean , even now , you ask people , " Why did your product or why did your company fail ? " 
and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things : under - capitalized , the wrong people , bad market conditions . 
It 's always the same three things , so let 's explore that . 
Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine . 
Money was no problem . 
He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well - connected ; he knew all the big minds of the day . 
He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic . 
The New York Times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was rooting for Langley . 
Then how come we 've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley ? 
A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio , Orville and Wilbur Wright , they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success . 
They had no money ; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop ; not a single person on the Wright brothers ' team had a college education , not even Orville or Wilbur ; and The New York Times followed them around nowhere . 
The difference was , Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief . 
They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine , it 'll change the course of the world . 
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different . 
He wanted to be rich , and he wanted to be famous . 
He was in pursuit of the result . 
He was in pursuit of the riches . 
And lo and behold , look what happened . 
The people who believed in the Wright brothers ' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears . 
The others just worked for the paycheck . 
And they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out , they would have to take five sets of parts , because that 's how many times they would crash before they came in for supper . 
And , eventually , on December 17th , 1903 , the Wright brothers took flight , and no one was there to even experience it . 
We found out about it a few days later . 
And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing : The day the Wright brothers took flight , he quit . 
He could have said , " That 's an amazing discovery , guys , and I will improve upon your technology , " but he did n't . 
He was n't first , he did n't get rich , he did n't get famous so he quit . 
People do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it . 
And if you talk about what you believe , you will attract those who believe what you believe . 
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe ? 
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation , and if you do n't know the law , you definitely know the terminology . 
The first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators . 
The next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adopters . 
The next 34 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your laggards . 
The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you ca n't buy rotary phones anymore . 
We all sit at various places at various times on this scale , but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass - market success or mass - market acceptance of an idea , you can not have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration , and then the system tips . 
And I love asking businesses , " What 's your conversion on new business ? " 
And they love to tell you , " Oh , it 's about 10 percent , " proudly . 
Well , you can trip over 10 percent of the customers . 
We all have about 10 percent who just " get it . " 
That 's how we describe them , right ? 
That 's like that gut feeling , " Oh , they just get it . " 
The problem is : How do you find the ones that get it before you 're doing business with them versus the ones who do n't get it ? 
So it 's this here , this little gap that you have to close , as Jeffrey Moore calls it , " Crossing the Chasm " -- because , you see , the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first . 
And these guys , the innovators and the early adopters , they 're comfortable making those gut decisions . 
They 're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available . 
These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out , when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf . 
These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat screen TVs when they first came out , even though the technology was substandard . 
And , by the way , they did n't do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves . 
It 's because they wanted to be first . 
People do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe . 
In fact , people will do the things that prove what they believe . 
The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours , stood in line for six hours , was because of what they believed about the world , and how they wanted everybody to see them : They were first . 
People do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it . 
So let me give you a famous example , a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation . 
First , the famous failure . 
It 's a commercial example . 
As we said before , a second ago , the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions , right ? You should have success then . 
Look at TiVo . 
From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day , they are the single highest - quality product on the market , hands down , there is no dispute . 
They were extremely well - funded . 
Market conditions were fantastic . 
I mean , we use TiVo as verb . 
I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time . 
But TiVo 's a commercial failure . 
They 've never made money . 
And when they went IPO , their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted , and it 's never traded above 10 . 
In fact , I do n't think it 's even traded above six , except for a couple of little spikes . 
Because you see , when TiVo launched their product they told us all what they had . 
They said , " We have a product that pauses live TV , skips commercials , rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking . " 
And the cynical majority said , " We do n't believe you . 
We do n't need it . We do n't like it . 
You 're scaring us . " 
What if they had said , " If you 're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life , boy , do we have a product for you . 
It pauses live TV , skips commercials , memorizes your viewing habits , etc . , etc . " 
People do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it , and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe . 
Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation . 
In the summer of 1963 , 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak . 
They sent out no invitations , and there was no website to check the date . 
How do you do that ? 
Well , Dr. King was n't the only man in America who was a great orator . 
He was n't the only man in America who suffered in a pre - civil rights America . 
In fact , some of his ideas were bad . 
But he had a gift . 
He did n't go around telling people what needed to change in America . 
He went around and told people what he believed . 
" I believe , I believe , I believe , " he told people . 
And people who believed what he believed took his cause , and they made it their own , and they told people . 
And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people . 
And lo and behold , 250,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak . 
How many of them showed up for him ? 
Zero . 
They showed up for themselves . 
It 's what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August . 
It 's what they believed , and it was n't about black versus white : 25 percent of the audience was white . 
Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world : those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by man . 
And not until all the laws that are made by man are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority will we live in a just world . 
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life . 
We followed , not for him , but for ourselves . 
And , by the way , he gave the " I have a dream " speech , not the " I have a plan " speech . 
Listen to politicians now , with their comprehensive 12-point plans . 
They 're not inspiring anybody . 
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead . 
Leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us . 
Whether they 're individuals or organizations , we follow those who lead , not because we have to , but because we want to . 
We follow those who lead , not for them , but for ourselves . 
And it 's those who start with " why " that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them . 
Thank you very much .

How do you remember where you parked your car ? How do you know if you 're moving in the right direction ? Neuroscientist Neil Burgess studies the neural mechanisms that map the space around us , and how they link to memory and imagination .

Neil Burgess : How your brain tells you where you are 
When we park in a big parking lot , how do we remember where we parked our car ? 
Here 's the problem facing Homer . 
And we 're going to try to understand what 's happening in his brain . 
So we 'll start with the hippocampus , shown in yellow , which is the organ of memory . 
If you have damage there , like in Alzheimer 's , you ca n't remember things including where you parked your car . 
It 's named after Latin for " seahorse , " which it resembles . 
And like the rest of the brain , it 's made of neurons . 
So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it . 
And the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other . 
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells , which are very densely interconnected . 
And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food . 
So we 're going to imagine we 're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here . 
And when it fires a little spike of electricity , there 's going to be a red dot and a click . 
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment . 
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike . 
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal 's location . 
And if we record from lots of different neurons , we 'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment , like in this square box shown here . 
So together they form a map for the rest of the brain , telling the brain continually , " Where am I now within my environment ? " 
Place cells are also being recorded in humans . 
So epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring . 
And some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town . 
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire , become active , start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town . 
So how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment ? 
Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important . 
So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat 's in . 
And when you expand the box , the firing location expands . 
The one below likes to fire whenever there 's a wall close by to the south . 
And if you put another wall inside the box , then the cell fires in both place wherever there 's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box . 
So this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus . 
And indeed , on the inputs to the hippocampus , cells are found which project into the hippocampus , which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it 's exploring around . 
So the cell on the left , you can see , it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east , whether it 's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table , which the animals are running around . 
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there 's a boundary to the south , whether it 's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart . 
So that 's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it 's exploring around . 
We can also test where we think objects are , like this goal flag , in simple environments -- or indeed , where your car would be . 
So we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember . 
And then , if we put them back in the environment , generally they 're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was . 
But on some trials , we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell . 
In that case , we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment . 
And what you see , for example , if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment , and then if you ask people where it was , but you 've made the environment bigger , where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out . 
It 's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location , and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern . 
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember . 
But we also know where we are through movement . 
So if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements , which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back . 
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell . 
Now grid cells are found , again , on the inputs to the hippocampus , and they 're a bit like place cells . 
But now as the rat explores around , each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid . 
And if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid - like firing pattern across the environment , and each cell 's grid - like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells . 
So the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one . 
So together , it 's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you 'd find on a map , but using triangles . 
And as it moves around , the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is , so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment . 
Do people have grid cells ? 
Well because all of the grid - like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry , the same orientations of grid , shown in orange here , it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we 're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between . 
So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal . 
And indeed , you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex , which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats . 
So back to Homer . 
He 's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked . 
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary - detecting cells . 
He 's also remembering the path he took out of the car park , which would be represented in the firing of grid cells . 
Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire . 
And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car . 
And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car 's actually there . 
Maybe it 's been towed . 
But he knows where it was , so he knows to go and get it . 
So beyond spatial memory , if we look for this grid - like firing pattern throughout the whole brain , we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks , like remembering the last time you went to a wedding , for example . 
So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene , at least , of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them . 
So if this was happening , your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint . 
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space . 
Another kind of cell , head direction cells , which I did n't mention yet , they fire like a compass according to which way you 're facing . 
They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery , so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding , for example . 
So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we 're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains . 
Thank you very much .

Imagine a global security driven by collaboration -- among agencies , government , the private sector and the public . That 's not just the distant hope of open - source fans , it 's the vision of James Stavridis , the Supreme Commander of NATO , who shares vivid moments from recent military history to explain why security of the future should be built with bridges rather than walls .

James Stavridis : How NATO 's Supreme Commander thinks about global security 
I 'm gon na talk a little bit about open - source security , because we 've got to get better at security in this 21st century . 
Let me start by saying , let 's look back to the 20th century , and kind of get a sense of how that style of security worked for us . 
This is Verdun , a battlefield in France just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium . 
At Verdun , in 1916 , over a 300-day period , 700,000 people were killed , so about 2,000 a day . 
If you roll it forward -- 20th - century security -- into the Second World War , you see the Battle of Stalingrad , 300 days , 2 million people killed . 
We go into the Cold War , and we continue to try and build walls . 
We go from the trench warfare of the First World War to the Maginot Line of the Second World War , and then we go into the Cold War , the Iron Curtain , the Berlin Wall . 
Walls do n't work . 
My thesis for us today is , instead of building walls to create security , we need to build bridges . 
This is a famous bridge in Europe . 
It 's in Bosnia - Herzegovina . 
It 's the bridge over the Drina River , the subject of a novel by Ivo Andrić , and it talks about how , in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans , over time there 's been enormous building of walls . 
More recently , in the last decade , we begin to see these communities start , hesitatingly , to come together . 
I would argue , again , open - source security is about connecting the international , the interagency , the private - public , and lashing it together with strategic communication , largely in social networks . 
So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that , because our global commons is under attack in a variety of ways , and none of the sources of threat to the global commons will be solved by building walls . 
Now , I 'm a sailor , obviously . 
This is a ship , a liner , clipping through the Indian Ocean . 
What 's wrong with this picture ? 
It 's got concertina wire along the sides of it . 
That 's to prevent pirates from attacking it . 
Piracy is a very active threat today around the world . This is in the Indian Ocean . 
Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca . 
It 's active in the Gulf of Guinea . 
We see it in the Caribbean . 
It 's a $ 10-billion - a - year discontinuity in the global transport system . 
Last year , at this time , there were 20 vessels , 500 mariners held hostage . 
This is an attack on the global commons . 
We need to think about how to address it . 
Let 's shift to a different kind of sea , the cyber sea . 
Here are photographs of two young men . 
At the moment , they 're incarcerated . 
They conducted a credit card fraud that netted them over 10 billion dollars . 
This is part of cybercrime which is a $ 2-trillion - a - year discontinuity in the global economy . 
Two trillion a year . 
That 's just under the GDP of Great Britain . 
So this cyber sea , which we know endlessly is the fundamental piece of radical openness , is very much under threat as well . 
Another thing I worry about in the global commons is the threat posed by trafficking , by the movement of narcotics , opium , here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe over to the United States . 
We worry about cocaine coming from the Andean Ridge north . 
We worry about the movement of illegal weapons and trafficking . Above all , perhaps , we worry about human trafficking , and the awful cost of it . 
Trafficking moves largely at sea but in other parts of the global commons . 
This is a photograph , and I wish I could tell you that this is a very high - tech piece of US Navy gear that we 're using to stop the trafficking . 
The bad news is , this is a semi - submersible run by drug cartels . 
It was built in the jungles of South America . 
We caught it with that low - tech raft — — and it was carrying six tons of cocaine . 
Crew of four . Sophisticated communications sweep . 
This kind of trafficking , in narcotics , in humans , in weapons , God forbid , in weapons of mass destruction , is part of the threat to the global commons . 
And let 's pull it together in Afghanistan today . 
This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan . 
Eighty to 90 percent of the world 's poppy , opium and heroin , comes out of Afghanistan . 
We also see there , of course , terrorism . 
This is where al Qaeda is staged from . 
We also see a very strong insurgency embedded there . 
So this terrorism concern is also part of the global commons , and what we must address . 
So here we are , 21st century . 
We know our 20th - century tools are not going to work . 
What should we do ? 
I would argue that we will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun . 
We will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun . 
We will need the application of military force . 
When we do it , we must do it well , and competently . 
But my thesis is , open - source security is about international , interagency , private - public connection pulled together by this idea of strategic communication on the Internet . 
Let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way . 
This is Afghanistan . These are Afghan soldiers . 
They are all holding books . 
You should say , " That 's odd . I thought I read that this demographic , young men and women in their 20s and 30s , is largely illiterate in Afghanistan . " 
You would be correct . 
Eighty - five percent can not read when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan . 
Why ? Because the Taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read . 
So the question is , so , why are they all standing there holding books ? 
The answer is , we are teaching them to read in literacy courses by NATO in partnership with private sector entities , in partnership with development agencies . 
We 've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces to read and write at a basic level . 
When you can read and write in Afghanistan , you will typically put a pen in your pocket . 
At the ceremonies , when these young men and women graduate , they take that pen with great pride , and put it in their pocket . 
This is bringing together international — there are 50 nations involved in this mission — interagency — these development agencies — and private - public , to take on this kind of security . 
Now , we are also teaching them combat skills , of course , but I would argue , open - source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect . 
Here 's another example . 
This is a US Navy warship . 
It 's called the Comfort . 
There 's a sister ship called the Mercy . 
They are hospital ships . 
This one , the Comfort , operates throughout the Caribbean and the coast of South America conducting patient treatments . 
On a typical cruise , they 'll do 400,000 patient treatments . 
It is crewed not strictly by military but by a combination of humanitarian organizations : Operation Hope , Project Smile . 
Other organizations send volunteers . 
Interagency physicians come out . 
They 're all part of this . 
To give you one example of the impact this can have , this little boy , eight years old , walked with his mother two days to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort . 
When he was fitted , over his extremely myopic eyes , he suddenly looked up and said , " Mama , veo el mundo . " 
" Mom , I see the world . " 
Multiply this by 400,000 patient treatments , this private - public collaboration with security forces , and you begin to see the power of creating security in a very different way . 
Here you see baseball players . 
Can you pick out the two US Army soldiers in this photograph ? 
They are the two young men on either side of these young boys . This is part of a series of baseball clinics , where we have explored collaboration between Major League Baseball , the Department of State , who sets up the diplomatic piece of this , military baseball players , who are real soldiers with real skills but participate in this mission , and they put on clinics throughout Latin America and the Caribbean , in Honduras , in Nicaragua , in all of the Central American and Caribbean nations where baseball is so popular , and it creates security . 
It shows role models to young men and women about fitness and about life that I would argue help create security for us . 
Another aspect of this partnership is in disaster relief . 
This is a US Air Force helicopter participating after the tsunami in 2004 which killed 250,000 people . 
In each of these major disasters — the tsunami in 2004 , 250,000 dead , the Kashmiri earthquake in Pakistan , 2005 , 85,000 dead , the Haitian earthquake , about 300,000 dead , more recently the awful earthquake - tsunami combination which struck Japan and its nuclear industry — in all of these instances , we see partnerships between international actors , interagency , private - public working with security forces to respond to this kind of natural disaster . 
So these are examples of this idea of open - source security . 
We tie it together , increasingly , by doing things like this . 
Now , you 're looking at this thinking , " Ah , Admiral , these must be sea lanes of communication , or these might be fiber optic cables . " 
No . This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter . 
Purple are tweets . Green are geolocation . 
White is the synthesis . 
It 's a perfect evocation of that great population survey , the six largest nations in the world in descending order : China , India , Facebook , the United States , Twitter and Indonesia . 
Why do we want to get in these nets ? 
Why do we want to be involved ? 
We talked earlier about the Arab Spring , and the power of all this . 
I 'll give you another example , and it 's how you move this message . 
I gave a talk like this in London a while back about this point . I said , as I say to all of you , I 'm on Facebook . Friend me . 
Got a little laugh from the audience . 
There was an article which was run by AP , on the wire . 
Got picked up in two places in the world : Finland and Indonesia . 
The headline was : NATO Admiral Needs Friends . 
Thank you . 
Which I do . 
And the story was a catalyst , and the next morning I had hundreds of Facebook friend requests from Indonesians and Finns , mostly saying , " Admiral , we heard you need a friend , and oh , by the way , what is NATO ? " 
So ... 
Yeah , we laugh , but this is how we move the message , and moving that message is how we connect international , interagency , private - public , and these social nets to help create security . 
Now , let me hit a somber note . 
This is a photograph of a brave British soldier . 
I put him here to remind us , I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking that we do not need capable , competent militaries who can create real military effect . 
That is the core of who we are and what we do , and we do it to protect freedom , freedom of speech , all the things we treasure in our societies . 
But , you know , life is not an on - and - off switch . 
You do n't have to have a military that is either in hard combat or is in the barracks . 
I would argue life is a rheostat . 
You have to dial it in , and as I think about how we create security in this 21st century , there will be times when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis , but there will be many instances , as we 've talked about today , where our militaries can be part of creating 21st - century security , international , interagency , private - public , connected with competent communication . 
I would close by saying that we heard earlier today about Wikipedia . I use Wikipedia all the time to look up facts , and as all of you appreciate , Wikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people locked in a room writing articles . 
Wikipedia , every day , is tens of thousands of people inputting information , and every day millions of people withdrawing that information . 
It 's a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together . 
No one person , no one alliance , no one nation , no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together . 
The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple : a world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge . 
My thesis for you is that by combining international , interagency , private - public , strategic communication , together , in this 21st century , we can create the sum of all security . 
Thank you . 
Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you .

One , it 's a very attractive planet -- it just has the beauty of the rings and so on . 
But for scientists , also the rings have a special meaning , because we believe they represent , on a small scale , how the Solar System actually formed . 
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed , that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun , a lot of the dust around it created rings and then the particles in those rings accumulated together , and they formed bigger rocks , and then that 's how the planets , you know , were formed . 
So , the idea is , by watching Saturn we 're actually watching our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale , so it 's like a test bed for it . 
So , let me show you a little bit on what that Saturnian system looks like . 
First , I 'm going to fly you over the rings . 
By the way , all of this is real stuff . 
This is not animation or anything like this . 
This is actually taken from the satellite that we have in orbit around Saturn , the Cassini . 
And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings , which are the particles . 
Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles . 
So that 's why you have these gaps , is because a small satellite , you know , is being formed in that location . 
Now , you think that those rings are very large objects . 
Yes , they are very large in one dimension ; in the other dimension they are paper thin . Very , very thin . 
What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself . 
And that 's one of the satellites which was actually formed on that one . 
So , think about it as a paper - thin , huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles , which is rotating . 
And we have a wide variety of kind of satellites which will form , each one looking very different and very odd , and that keeps scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this , and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain what these things look like , or why they formed that way . 
Well , there were two satellites which were particularly interesting . 
One of them is called Enceladus . 
It 's a satellite which was all made of ice , and we measured it from orbit . Made of ice . 
But there was something bizarre about it . 
If you look at these stripes in here , what we call tiger stripes , when we flew over them , all of a sudden we saw an increase in the temperature , which said that those stripes are warmer than the rest of the planet . 
So as we flew by away from it , we looked back . And guess what ? 
We saw geysers coming out . 
So this is a Yellowstone , you know , of Saturn . 
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet , which indicate that most likely there is an ocean , you know , below the surface . 
And somehow , through some dynamic effect , we 're having these geysers which are being , you know , emitted from it . 
And the reason I showed the little arrow there , I think that should say 30 miles , we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft through the plume of that geyser so we can actually measure the material that it is made of . 
That was [ unclear ] also -- you know , because we were worried about the risk of it , but it worked pretty well . 
We flew at the top of it , and we found that there is a fair amount of organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice . 
And over the next few years , as we keep orbiting , you know , Saturn , we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface and make more accurate measurements . 
Now , another satellite also attracted a lot of attention , and that 's Titan . And the reason Titan is particularly interesting , it 's a satellite bigger than our moon , and it has an atmosphere . 
And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere . 
So if you were on Titan , you would feel the same pressure that you feel in here . Except it 's a lot colder , and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane . 
Now , methane gets people all excited , because it 's organic material , so immediately people start thinking , could life have evolved in that location , when you have a lot of organic material . 
So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call a pre - biotic planet , because it 's so cold organic material did not get to the stage of becoming biological material , and therefore life could have evolved on it . 
So it could be Earth , frozen three billion years ago before life actually started on it . 
So that 's getting a lot of interest , and to show you some example of what we did in there , we actually dropped a probe , which was developed by our colleagues in Europe , we dropped a probe as we were orbiting Saturn . 
We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan . 
And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down . 
Just looked like the coast of California for me . 
You see the rivers which are coming along the coast , and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island , and that looks like an ocean . 
And then with an instrument we have on board , a radar instrument , we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here , so it looks very much like Earth . 
It looks like there are rivers on it , there are oceans or lakes , we know there are clouds . We think it 's raining also on it . 
So it 's very much like the cycle on Earth except because it 's so cold , it could not be water , you know , because water would have frozen . 
What it turned out , that all that we are seeing , all this liquid , [ is made of ] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane , similar to what you put in your car . 
So here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our Earth , but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material . 
So if you were on Mars -- sorry , on Titan , you do n't have to worry about four - dollar gasoline . 
You just drive to the nearest lake , stick your hose in it , and you 've got your car filled up . 
On the other hand , if you light a match the whole planet will blow up . 
So in closing , I said I want to close by a couple of pictures . 
And just to kind of put us in perspective , this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft from behind Saturn , looking towards the Sun . 
The Sun is behind Saturn , so we see what we call " forward scattering , " so it highlights all the rings . And I 'm going to zoom . 
There is a -- I 'm not sure you can see it very well , but on the top left , around 10 o'clock , there is a little teeny dot , and that 's Earth . 
You barely can see ourselves . So what I did , I thought I 'd zoom on it . 
So as you zoom in , you know , you can see Earth , you know , just in the middle here . So we zoomed all the way on the art center . 
So thank you very much .

Daniel Kraft : Medicine 's future ? There 's an app for that 
A couple of years ago when I was attending the TED Conference in Long Beach , I met Harriet . 
We 'd actually met online before -- not the way you 're thinking . 
We were actually introduced because we both knew Linda Avey , one of the founders of the first online personal genomic companies . 
And because we shared our genetic information with Linda , she could see that Harriet and I shared a very rare type of mitochondrial DNA -- Haplotype K1a1b1a -- which meant that we were distantly related . 
We actually share the same genealogy with Ozzie the iceman . 
So Ozzie , Harriet and me . 
And being the current day , of course , we started our own Facebook group . 
You 're all welcome to join . 
And when I met Harriet in person the next year at the TED Conference , she 'd gone online and ordered our own happy Haplotype T - shirts . 
Now why am I telling you this story , and what does this have to do with the future of health ? 
Well the way I met Harriet is actually an example of how leveraging cross - disciplinary , exponentially - growing technologies is affecting our future of health and wellness -- from low - cost gene analysis to the ability to do powerful bio - informatics to the connection of the Internet and social networking . 
What I 'd like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies . 
We often think linearly . 
But if you think about it , if you have a lily pad and it just divided every single day -- two , four , eight , 16 -- in 15 days you have 32,000 . 
What do you think you have in a month ? We 're at a billion . 
So if we start to think exponentially , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us . 
And many of these technologies -- speaking as a physician and innovator -- we can really start to leverage to impact the future of our own health and of health care , and to address many of the major challenges that we have in health care today , ranging from the really exponential costs to the aging population , the way we really do n't use information very well today , the fragmentation of care and often the very difficult course of adoption of innovation . 
And one of the major things we can do we 've talked a bit about here today is moving the curve to the left . 
We spend most of our money on the last 20 percent of life . 
What if we could spend and incentivize positions in the health care system and our own self to move the curve to the left and improve our health , leveraging technology as well ? 
Now my favorite technology , example of exponential technology , we all have in our pocket . 
So if you think about it , these are really dramatically improving . 
I mean this is the iPhone 4 . 
Imagine what the iPhone 8 will be able to do . 
Now , I 've gained some insight into this . 
I 've been the track share for the medicine portion of a new institution called Singularity University based in Silicon Valley . 
And we bring together every summer about 100 very talented students from around the world . 
And we look at these exponential technologies from medicine , biotech , artificial intelligence , robotics , nanotechnology , space , and address how can we cross - train and leverage these to impact major unmet goals . 
We also have seven - day executive programs . 
And coming up next month is actually Future Med , a program to help cross - train and leverage technologies into medicine . 
Now I mentioned the phone . 
These mobile phones have over 20,000 different mobile apps available -- to the point where there 's one out of the U.K. 
where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iPhone and check yourself for an STD . 
I do n't know if I 'd try that yet , but that 's available . 
There are all other sorts of applications , merging your phone and diagnostics , for example -- measuring your blood glucose on your iPhone and sending that , potentially , to your physician so they can better understand and you can better understand your blood sugars as a diabetic . 
So let 's see now how exponential technologies are taking health care . 
Let 's start with faster . 
Well it 's no secret that computers , through Moore 's law , are speeding up faster and faster . 
We have the ability to do more powerful things with them . 
They 're really approaching , in many cases surpassing , the ability of the human mind . 
But where I think computational speed is most applicable is in that of imaging . 
The ability now to look inside the body in real time with very high resolution is really becoming incredible . 
And we 're layering multiple technologies -- PET scans , CT scans and molecular diagnostics -- to find and to seek things at different levels . 
Here you 're going to see the very highest resolution MRI scan done today , reconstructed of Marc Hodosh , the curator of TEDMED . 
And now we can see inside of the brain with a resolution and ability that was never before available , and essentially learn how to reconstruct , and maybe even re - engineer , or backwards engineer , the brain so we can better understand pathology , disease and therapy . 
We can look inside with real time fMRI -- in the brain at real time . 
And by understanding these sorts of processes and these sorts of connections , we 're going to understand the effects of medication or meditation and better personalize and make effective , for example , psychoactive drugs . 
The scanners for these are getting small , less expensive and more portable . 
And this sort of data explosion available from these is really almost becoming a challenge . 
The scan of today takes up about 800 books , or 20 gigabytes . 
The scan in a couple of years will be one terabyte , or 800,000 books . 
How do you leverage that information ? 
Let 's get personal . I wo n't ask who here 's had a colonoscopy , but if you 're over age 50 , it 's time for your screening colonoscopy . 
How would you like to avoid the pointy end of the stick ? 
Well now there 's essentially a virtual colonoscopy . 
Compare those two pictures , and now as a radiologist , you can essentially fly through your patient 's colon and , augmenting that with artificial intelligence , identify potentially , as you see here , a lesion . 
Oh , we might have missed it , but using A.I. on top of radiology , we can find lesions that were missed before . 
And maybe this will encourage people to get colonoscopies that would n't have otherwise . 
And this is an example of this paradigm shift . 
We 're moving to this integration of biomedicine , information technology , wireless and , I would say , mobile now -- this era of digital medicine . 
So even my stethoscope is now digital . 
And of course , there 's an app for that . 
We 're moving , obviously , to the era of the tricorder . 
So the handheld ultrasound is basically surpassing and supplanting the stethoscope . 
These are now at a price point of -- what used to be 100,000 euros or a couple of hundred - thousand dollars -- for about 5,000 dollars , I can have the power of a very powerful diagnostic device in my hand . 
And merging this now with the advent of electronic medical records -- in the United States , we 're still less than 20 percent electronic . 
Here in the Netherlands , I think it 's more than 80 percent . 
But now that we 're switching to merging medical data , making it available electronically , we can crowd source that information , and now as a physician , I can access my patients ' data from wherever I am just through my mobile device . 
And now , of course , we 're in the era of the iPad , even the iPad 2 . 
And just last month the first FDA - approved application was approved to allow radiologists to do actual reading on these sorts of devices . 
So certainly , the physicians of today , including myself , are completely reliable on these devices . 
And as you saw just about a month ago , Watson from IBM beat the two champions in Jeopardy . 
So I want you to imagine when in a couple of years , when we 've started to apply this cloud - based information , when we really have the A.I. physician and leverage our brains to connectivity to make decisions and diagnostics at a level never done . 
Already today , you do n't need to go to your physician in many cases . 
Only for about 20 percent of actual visits do you have to lay hands on the patient . 
We 're now in the era of virtual visits -- from sort of the Skype - type visits you can do with American Well , to Cisco that 's developed a very complex health presence system . 
The ability to interact with your health care provider is different . 
And these are being augmented even by our devices again today . 
Here my friend Jessica sent me a picture of her head laceration so I can save her a trip to the emergency room -- I can do some diagnostics that way . 
Or might we be able to leverage today 's gaming technology , like the Microsoft Kinect , and hack that to enable diagnostics , for example , in diagnosing stroke , using simple motion detection , using hundred - dollar devices . 
We can actually now visit our patients robotically -- this is the RP7 ; if I 'm a hematologist , visit another clinic , visit a hospital . 
These will be augmented by a whole suite of tools actually in the home now . 
So imagine we already have wireless scales . 
You can step on the scale . 
You can Tweet your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line . 
We have wireless blood pressure cuffs . 
A whole gamut of these technologies are being put together . 
So instead of wearing these kludgy devices , we can put on a simple patch . 
This was developed by colleagues at Stanford , called the iRhythm -- completely supplants the prior technology at a much lower price point with much more effectivity . 
Now we 're also in the era , today , of quantified self . 
Consumers now can buy basically hundred - dollar devices , like this little FitBit . 
I can measure my steps , my caloric outtake . 
I can get insight into that on a daily basis . 
I can share that with my friends , with my physician . 
There 's watches coming out that will measure your heart rate , the Zeo sleep monitors , a whole suite of tools that can enable you to leverage and have insight into your own health . 
And as we start to integrate this information , we 're going to know better what to do with it and how better to have insight into our own pathologies , health and wellness . 
There 's even mirrors today that can pick up your pulse rate . 
And I would argue , in the future , we 'll have wearable devices in our clothes , monitoring ourselves 24/7 . 
And just like we have the OnStar system in cars , your red light might go on -- it wo n't say " check engine " though . 
It 's going to be " check your body " light , and go in and get it taken care of . 
Probably in a few years , you 'll check into your mirror and it 's going to be diagnosing you . 
For those of you with kiddos at home , how would you like to have the wireless diaper that supports your ... 
too much information , I think , than you might need . 
But it 's going to be here . 
Now we 've heard a lot today about new technology and connection . 
And I think some of these technologies will enable us to be more connected with our patients , and take more time and actually do the important human touch elements of medicine , as augmented by these sorts of technologies . 
Now we 've talked about augmenting the patient , to some degree . 
How about augmenting the physician ? 
We 're now in the era of super - enabling the surgeon who can now go inside the body and do things with robotic surgery , which is here today , at a level that was not really possible even five years ago . 
Now this is being augmented with further layers of technology like augmented reality . 
So the surgeon can see inside the patient , through their lens , where the tumor is , where the blood vessels are . 
This can be integrated with decisions support . 
A surgeon in New York can be helping a surgeon in Amsterdam , for example . 
And we 're entering an era of really , truly scarless surgery called NOTES , where the robotic endoscope can come out the stomach and pull out that gallbladder all in a scarless way and robotically . 
And this is called NOTES , and this is coming -- basically scarless surgery , as mediated by robotic surgery . 
Now how about controlling other elements ? 
For those who have disabilities -- the paraplegic -- there 's the era of brain - computer interface , or BCI , where chips have been put on the motor cortex of completely quadriplegic patients and they can control a curser or a wheelchair or , eventually , a robotic arm . 
And these devices are getting smaller and going into more and more of these patients . 
Still in clinical trials , but imagine when we can connect these , for example , to the amazing bionic limb , such as the DEKA Arm built by Dean Kamen and colleagues , which has 17 degrees of motion and freedom and can allow the person who 's lost a limb to have much higher levels of dexterity or control than they 've had in the past . 
So we 're really entering the era of wearable robotics actually . 
If you have n't lost a limb -- you 've had a stroke , for example -- you can wear these augmented limbs . 
Or if you 're a paraplegic -- like I 've visited the folks at Berkley Bionics -- they 've developed eLEGS . 
I took this video last week . Here 's a paraplegic patient actually walking by strapping on these exoskeletons . 
He 's otherwise completely wheelchair - bound . 
And now this is the early era of wearable robotics . 
And I think by leveraging these sorts of technologies , we 're going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability , or super - enabling . 
This is Aimee Mullins , who lost her lower limbs as a young child , and Hugh Herr , who 's a professor at MIT who lost his limbs in a climbing accident . 
And now both of these can climb better , move faster , swim differently with their prosthetics than us normal - abled persons . 
Now how about other exponentials ? 
Clearly the obesity trend is exponentially going in the wrong direction , including with huge costs . 
But the trend in medicine actually is to get exponentially smaller . 
So a few examples : we 're now in the era of " Fantastic Voyage , " the iPill . 
You can swallow this completely integrated device . 
It can take pictures of your GI system , help diagnose and treat as it moves through your GI tract . 
We get into even smaller micro - robots that will eventually autonomously move through your system again and be able to do things that surgeons ca n't do in a much less invasive manner . 
Sometimes these might self - assemble in your GI system and be augmented in that reality . 
On the cardiac side , pacemakers are getting smaller and much easier to place so you do n't need to train an interventional cardiologist to place them . 
And they 're going to be wirelessly telemetered again to your mobile devices so you can go places and be monitored remotely . 
These are shrinking even further . 
Here 's one that 's in prototyping by Medtronic that 's smaller than a penny . 
Artificial retinas , the ability to put these arrays on the back of the eyeball and allow the blind to see . 
Again , in early trials , but moving into the future . 
These are going to be game changing . 
Or for those of us who are sighted , how about having the assisted - living contact lens ? 
BlueTooth , WiFi available -- beams back images to your eye . 
Now if you have trouble maintaining your diet , it might help to have some extra imagery to remind you how many calories are going to be coming at you . 
How about enabling the pathologist to use their cell phone again to see at a microscopic level and to lumber that data back to the cloud and make better diagnostics ? 
In fact , the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing . 
We can now leverage microfluidics , like this chip made by Steve Quake at Stanford . 
Microfluidics can replace an entire lab of technicians . 
Put it on a chip , enable thousands of tests to be done at the point of care , anywhere in the world . 
And this is really going to leverage technology to the rural and the under - served and enable what used to be thousand - dollar tests to be done at pennies and at the point of care . 
If we go down the small pathway a little bit farther , we 're entering the era of nanomedicine , the ability to make devices super small to the point where we can design red blood cells or microrobots that will monitor our blood system or immune system , or even those that might clear out the clots from our arteries . 
Now how about exponentially cheaper ? 
Not something we usually think about in the era of medicine , but hard disks used to be 3,400 dollars for 10 megabytes -- exponentially cheaper . 
In genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out . 
We 're now approaching essentially a thousand - dollar genome -- probably next year to two years , probably a hundred - dollar genome . 
What are we going to do with hundred - dollar genomes ? 
And soon we 'll have millions of these tests available . 
And that 's when it gets interesting , when we start to crowdsource that information . 
And we enter the era of true personalized medicine -- the right drug for the right person at the right time -- instead of what we 're doing today , which is the same drug for everybody -- sort of blockbuster drug medications , medications which do n't work for you , the individual . 
And many , many different companies are working on leveraging these approaches . 
And I 'll also show you a simple example , from 23andMe again . 
My data indicates that I 've got about average risk for developing macular degeneration , a kind of blindness . 
But if I take that same data , upload it to deCODEme , I can look at my risk for sample Type II diabetes . 
I 'm at almost twice the risk for Type II diabetes . 
I might want to watch how much dessert I have at the lunch break for example . 
It might change my behavior . 
Leveraging my knowledge of my pharmacogenomics -- how my genes modulate , what my drugs do and what doses I need are going to become increasingly important , and once in the hands of the individual and the patient , will make better drug dosing and selection available . 
So again , it 's not just genes , it 's multiple details -- our habits , our environmental exposure . 
When was the last time your physician asked you where you 've lived ? 
Geomedicine : where you 've lived , what you 've been exposed to , can dramatically affect your health . 
We can capture that information . 
So genomics , proteomics , the environment , all this data streaming at us individually and us , as poor physicians , how do we manage it ? 
Well we 're now entering the era of systems medicine , or systems biology , where we can start to integrate all of this information . 
And by looking at the patterns , for example , in our blood of 10,000 biomarkers in a single test , we can start to look at these little patterns and detect disease at a much earlier stage . 
This has been called by Lee Hood , the father of the field , P4 medicine . 
We 're going to be predictive ; we 're going to know what you 're likely to have . 
We can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized ; and more importantly , it 's going to become increasingly participatory . 
Through websites like Patients Like Me or managing your data on Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health , leveraging this together in participatory ways is going to become increasingly important . 
So I 'll finish up with exponentially better . 
We 'd like to get therapies better and more effective . 
Now today we treat high blood pressure mostly with pills . 
What if we take a new device and knock out the nerve vessels that help mediate blood pressure and in a single therapy to cure hypertension ? 
This is a new device that is essentially doing that . 
It should be on the market within a year or two . 
How about more targeted therapies for cancer ? 
Right , I 'm an oncologist and I have to say most of what we give is actually poison . 
We 've learned at Stanford and other places that we can discover cancer stem cells , the ones that seem to be really responsible for disease relapse . 
So if you think of cancer as a weed , we often can whack the weed away . 
It seems to shrink , but it often comes back . 
So we 're attacking the wrong target . 
The cancer stem cells remain , and the tumor can return months or years later . 
We 're now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long - term cure . 
And we 're entering the era of personalized oncology , the ability to leverage all of this data together , analyze the tumor and come up with a real , specific cocktail for the individual patient . 
Now I 'll close with regenerative medicine . 
So I 've studied a lot about stem cells -- embryonic stem cells are particularly powerful . 
We also have adult stem cells throughout our body . 
We use those in my field of bone marrow transplantation . 
Geron , just last year , started the first trial using human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries . 
Still a Phase I trial , but evolving . 
We 've been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease . 
We take our own bone marrow cells and treat a patient with a heart attack , we can see much improved heart function and actually better survival using our own bone marrow drive cells after a heart attack . 
I invented a device called the MarrowMiner , a much less invasive way for harvesting bone marrow . 
It 's now been FDA approved , and it 'll hopefully be on the market in the next year or so . 
Hopefully you can appreciate the device there curving through the patient 's body and removing the patient 's bone marrow , instead of with 200 punctures , with just a single puncture under local anesthesia . 
But where is stem cell therapy really going ? 
If you think about it , every cell in your body has the same DNA as you had when you were an embryo . 
We can now reprogram your skin cells to actually act like a pluripotent embryonic stem cell and to utilize those potentially to treat multiple organs in that same patient -- making your own personalized stem cell lines . 
And I think they 'll be a new era of your own stem cell banking to have in the freezer your own cardiac cells , myocytes and neural cells to use them in the future , should you need them . 
And we 're integrating this now with a whole era of cellular engineering , and integrating exponential technologies for essentially 3D organ printing -- replacing the ink with cells and essentially building and reconstructing a 3D organ . 
That 's where things are going to head -- still very early days . 
But I think , as integration of exponential technologies , this is the example . 
So in close , as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine , we 're entering an era of miniaturization , decentralization and personalization . 
And I think by pulling these things together , if we can start to think about how to understand and leverage these , we 're going to empower the patient , enable the doctor , enhance wellness and begin to cure the well before they get sick . 
Because I know as a doctor , if someone comes to me with Stage I disease , I 'm thrilled -- we can often cure them . 
But often it 's too late and it 's Stage III or IV cancer , for example . 
So by leveraging these technologies together , I think we 'll enter a new era that I like to call Stage 0 medicine . 
And as a cancer doctor , I 'm looking forward to being out of a job . 
Thanks very much .

C.K. Williams ' poetry of youth and age 
I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject of youth and age . 
I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually . 
The first one is dedicated to Spencer , and his grandmother , who was shocked by his work . 
My poem is called " Dirt . " 
My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap ; half a long century gone and still she comes at me with that thick cruel yellow bar . 
All because of a word I said , not even said really , only repeated . 
But " Open , " she says , " open up ! " 
her hand clawing at my head . 
I know now her life was hard ; she lost three children as babies , then her husband died too , leaving young sons , and no money . 
She 'd stand me in the sink to pee because there was never room in the toilet . 
But oh , her soap ! 
Might its bitter burning have been what made me a poet ? 
The street she lived on was unpaved , her flat , two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen where she stalked and caught me . 
Dare I admit that after she did it I never really loved her again ? 
She lived to a hundred , even then . All along it was the sadness , the squalor , but I never , until now loved her again . 
When that was published in a magazine I got an irate letter from my uncle . 
" You have maligned a great woman . " 
It took some diplomacy . 
This is called " The Dress . " 
It 's a longer poem . 
In those days , those days which exist for me only as the most elusive memory now , when often the first sound you 'd hear in the morning would be a storm of birdsong , then the soft clop of the hooves of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block , and the last sound at night as likely as not would be your father pulling up in his car , having worked late again , always late , and going heavily down to the cellar , to the furnace , to shake out the ashes and damp the draft before he came upstairs to fall into bed -- in those long - ago days , women , my mother , my friends ' mothers , our neighbors , all the women I knew -- wore , often much of the day , what were called housedresses , cheap , printed , pulpy , seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and , when you had to go look for a child , hang wash on the line , or run down to the grocery store on the corner , under a coat , the twisted hem of the nightgown always lank and yellowed , dangling beneath . 
More than the curlers some of the women seemed constantly to have in their hair in preparation for some great event -- a ball , one would think -- that never came to pass ; more than the way most women 's faces not only were never made up during the day , but seemed scraped , bleached , and , with their plucked eyebrows , scarily masklike ; more than all that it was those dresses that made women so unknowable and forbidding , adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access , and boys no conception . 
Only later would I see the dresses also as a proclamation : that in your dim kitchen , your laundry , your bleak concrete yard , what you revealed of yourself was a fabulation ; your real sensual nature , veiled in those sexless vestments , was utterly your dominion . 
In those days , one hid much else as well : grown men did n't embrace one another , unless someone had died , and not always then ; you shook hands or , at a ball game , thumped your friend 's back and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection ; once out of childhood you 'd never again know the shock of your father 's whiskers on your cheek , not until mores at last had evolved , and you could hug another man , then hold on for a moment , then even kiss ( your fathers bristles white and stiff now ) . 
What release finally , the embrace : though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious -- how much unspoken joy there was in that affirmation of equality and communion , no matter how much misunderstanding and pain had passed between you by then . 
We knew so little in those days , as little as now , I suppose about healing those hurts : even the women , in their best dresses , with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices , even in lipstick and mascara , their hair aflow , could only stand wringing their hands , begging for peace , while father and son , like thugs , like thieves , like Romans , simmered and hissed and hated , inflicting sorrows that endured , the worst anyway , through the kiss and embrace , bleeding from brother to brother , into the generations . 
In those days there was still countryside close to the city , farms , cornfields , cows ; even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests . 
Or you could go out by yourself even to a half - block - long empty lot , into the bushes : like a creature of leaves you 'd lurk , crouched , crawling , simplified , savage , alone ; already there was wanting to be simpler , wanting , when they called you , never to go back . 
This is another longish one , about the old and the young . 
It actually happened right at the time we met . 
Part of the poem takes place in space we shared and time we shared . 
It 's called " The Neighbor . " 
Her five horrid , deformed little dogs who incessantly yap on the roof under my window . 
Her cats , God knows how many , who must piss on her rugs -- her landing 's a sickening reek . 
Her shadow once , fumbling the chain on her door , then the door slamming fearfully shut , only the barking and the music -- jazz -- filtering as it does , day and night into the hall . 
The time it was Chris Connor singing " Lush Life " -- how it brought back my college sweetheart , my first real love , who -- till I left her -- played the same record . 
And head on my shoulder , hand on my thigh , sang sweetly along , of regrets and depletions she was too young for , as I was too young , later , to believe in her pain . 
It startled , then bored , then repelled me . 
My starting to fancy she 'd ended up in this fire - trap in the Village , that my neighbor was her . 
My thinking we 'd meet , recognize one another , become friends , that I 'd accomplish a penance . 
My seeing her , it was n't her , at the mailbox . 
Gray - yellow hair , army pants under a nightgown , her turning away , hiding her ravaged face in her hands , muttering an inappropriate " Hi . " 
Sometimes there are frightening goings - on in the stairwell . 
A man shouting , " Shut up ! " The dogs frantically snarling , claws scrabbling , then her -- her voice hoarse , harsh , hollow , almost only a tone , incoherent , a note , a squawk , bone on metal , metal gone molten , calling them back , " Come back darlings , come back dear ones . 
My sweet angels , come back . " 
Medea she was , next time I saw her . 
Sorceress , tranced , ecstatic , stock - still on the sidewalk ragged coat hanging agape , passersby flowing around her , her mouth torn suddenly open as though in a scream , silently though , as though only in her brain or breast had it erupted . 
A cry so pure , practiced , detached , it had no need of a voice , or could no longer bear one . 
These invisible links that allure , these transfigurations , even of anguish , that hold us . 
The girl , my old love , the last lost time I saw her when she came to find me at a party , her drunkenly stumbling , falling , sprawling , skirt hiked , eyes veined red , swollen with tears , her shame , her dishonor . 
My ignorant , arrogant coarseness , my secret pride , my turning away . 
Still life on a rooftop , dead trees in barrels , a bench broken , dogs , excrement , sky . 
What pathways through pain , what junctures of vulnerability , what crossings and counterings ? 
Too many lives in our lives already , too many chances for sorrow , too many unaccounted - for pasts . 
" Behold me , " the god of frenzied , inexhaustible love says , rising in bloody splendor , " Behold me . " 
Her making her way down the littered vestibule stairs , one agonized step at a time . 
My holding the door . 
Her crossing the fragmented tiles , faltering at the step to the street , droning , not looking at me , " Can you help me ? " 
Taking my arm , leaning lightly against me . 
Her wavering step into the world . 
Her whispering , " Thanks love . " Lightly , lightly against me . 
I think I 'll lighten up a little . 
Another , different kind of poem of youth and age . 
It 's called " Gas . " 
Would n't it be nice , I think , when the blue - haired lady in the doctor 's waiting room bends over the magazine table and farts , just a little , and violently blushes . 
Would n't it be nice if intestinal gas came embodied in visible clouds , so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop had only barely grazed my face before it drifted away . 
Besides , for this to have happened now is a nice coincidence . Because not an hour ago , while we were on our walk , my dog was startled by a backfire and jumped straight up like a horse bucking . 
And that brought back to me the stable I worked on weekends when I was 12 , and a splendid piebald stallion , who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that , though more hugely of course , enormous , gleaming , resplendent . 
And the woman , her face abashedly buried in her " Elle " now , reminded me -- I 'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe consisted of the fact that with every jump he took the horse would powerfully fart . 
Phwap ! Phwap ! Phwap ! 
Something never mentioned in the dozens of books about horses and their riders I devoured in those days . 
All that savage grandeur , the steely glinting hooves , the eruptions driven from the creature 's mighty innards , breath stopped , heart stopped , nostrils madly flared , I did n't know if I wanted to break him , or be him . 
This is called " Thirst . " 
Many -- most of my poems actually are urban poems . I happen to be reading a bunch that are n't . 
" Thirst . " 
Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter , day and night , on a bench in the 103rd Street subway station , until finally one day she vanished . 
We regarded each other , scrutinized one another . 
Me shyly , obliquely , trying not to be furtive . 
She boldly , unblinkingly , even pugnaciously , wrathfully even , when her bottle was empty . 
I was frightened of her . I felt like a child . 
I was afraid some repressed part of myself would go out of control , and I 'd be forever entrapped in the shocking seethe of her stench . 
Not excrement merely , not merely surface and orifice going unwashed , rediffusion of rum , there was will in it , and intention , power and purpose -- a social , ethical rage and rebellion -- despair too , though , grief , loss . 
Sometimes I 'd think I should take her home with me , bathe her , comfort her , dress her . 
She would n't have wanted me to , I would think . 
Instead , I 'd step into my train . 
How rich I would think , is the lexicon of our self - absolving . 
How enduring , our bland fatal assurance that reflection is righteousness being accomplished . 
The dance of our glances , the clash , pulling each other through our perceptual punctures , then holocaust , holocaust , host on host of ill , injured presences , squandered , consumed . 
Her vigil somewhere I know continues . 
Her occupancy , her absolute , faithful attendance . 
The dance of our glances , challenge , abdication , effacement , the perfume of our consternation . 
This is a newer poem , a brand new poem . 
The title is " This Happened . " 
A student , a young woman in a fourth - floor hallway of her lycee , perched on the ledge of an open window chatting with friends between classes ; a teacher passes and chides her , " Be careful , you might fall , " almost banteringly chides her , " You might fall , " and the young woman , 18 , a girl really , though she would n't think that , as brilliant as she is , first in her class , and " Beautiful , too , " she 's often told , smiles back , and leans into the open window , which would n't even be open if it were winter -- if it were winter someone would have closed it -- leans into the window , farther , still smiling , farther and farther , though it takes less time than this , really an instant , and lets herself fall . 
Herself fall . 
A casual impulse , a fancy , never thought of until now , hardly thought of even now ... 
No , more than impulse or fancy , the girl knows what she 's doing , the girl means something , the girl means to mean , because it occurs to her in that instant , that beautiful or not , bright yes or no , she 's not who she is , she 's not the person she is , and the reason , she suddenly knows , is that there 's been so much premeditation where she is , so much plotting and planning , there 's hardly a person where she is , or if there is , it 's not her , or not wholly her , it 's a self inhabited , lived in by her , and seemingly even as she thinks it she knows what 's been missing : grace , not premeditation but grace , a kind of being in the world spontaneously , with grace . 
Weightfully upon me was the world . 
Weightfully this self which graced the world yet never wholly itself . 
Weightfully this self which weighed upon me , the release from which is what I desire and what I achieve . 
And the girl remembers , in this infinite instant already now so many times divided , the sadness she felt once , hardly knowing she felt it , to merely inhabit herself . 
Yes , the girl falls , absurd to fall , even the earth with its compulsion to take unto itself all that falls must know that falling is absurd , yet the girl falling is n't myself , or she is myself , but a self I took of my own volition unto myself . 
Forever . With grace . 
This happened . 
I 'll read just one more . I do n't usually say that . 
I like to just end . 
But I 'm afraid that Ricky will come out here and shake his fist at me . 
This is called " Old Man , " appropriately enough . 
" Special : big tits , " Says the advertisement for a soft - core magazine on our neighborhood newsstand . 
But forget her breasts . 
A lush , fresh - lipped blond , skin glowing gold , sprawls there , resplendent . 
60 nearly , yet these hardly tangible , hardly better than harlots , can still stir me . 
Maybe a coming of age in the American sensual darkness , never seeing an unsmudged nipple , an uncensored vagina , has left me forever infected with an unquenchable lust of the eye . 
Always that erotic murmur , I 'm hardly myself if I 'm not in a state of incipient desire . 
God knows though , there are worse twists your obsessions can take . 
Last year in Israel , a young ultra - orthodox Rabbi guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah forbade them to look in one room . 
Because there were images in it he said were licentious . 
The display was a photo . Men and women stripped naked , some trying to cover their genitals , others too frightened to bother , lined up in snow waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch . 
The girls , to my horror , averted their gaze . 
What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them . 
Even that though . Another confession : Once in a book on pre - war Poland , a studio portrait , an absolute angel , an absolute angel with tormented , tormenting eyes . 
I kept finding myself at her page . 
That she died in the camps made her -- I did n't dare wonder why -- more present , more precious . 
Died in the camps , that too people -- or Jews anyway -- kept from their children back then . 
But it was like sex , you did n't have to be told . 
Sex and death , how close they can seem . 
So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me , sometimes I think I confound them . 
My wife 's loveliness almost consumes me . 
My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds . 
When we make love , her holding me everywhere all around me , I 'm there and not there . 
My mind teems , jumbles of faces , voices , impressions , I live my life over , as though I were drowning . 
Then I am drowning , in despair at having to leave her , this , everything , all , unbearable , awful . 
Still , to be able to die with no special contrition , not having been slaughtered , or enslaved . 
And not having to know history 's next mad rage or regression , it might be a relief . 
No . Again , no . 
I do n't mean that for a moment . 
What I mean is the world holds me so tightly -- the good and the bad -- my own follies and weakness that even this counterfeit Venus with her sham heat , and her bosom probably plumped with gel , so moves me my breath catches . 
Vamp . Siren . Seductress . 
How much more she reveals in her glare of ink than she knows . 
How she incarnates our desperate human need for regard , our passion to live in beauty , to be beauty , to be cherished by glances , if by no more , of something like love , or love . 
Thank you .

Photographs do more than document history -- they make it . At TED University , Jonathan Klein of Getty Images shows some of the most iconic , and talks about what happens when a generation sees an image so powerful it ca n't look away -- or back .

Jonathan Klein : Photos that changed the world 
In my industry , we believe that images can change the world . 
Okay , we 're naive , we 're bright - eyed and bushy - tailed . 
The truth is that we know that the images themselves do n't change the world , but we 're also aware that , since the beginning of photography , images have provoked reactions in people , and those reactions have caused change to happen . 
So let 's begin with a group of images . 
I 'd be extremely surprised if you did n't recognize many or most of them . 
They 're best described as iconic : so iconic , perhaps , they 're cliches . 
In fact , they 're so well - known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form . 
But I think we 're looking for something more . 
We 're looking for something more . 
We 're looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues , images that transcend borders , that transcend religions , images that provoke us to step up and do something -- in other words , to act . 
Well , this image you 've all seen . 
It changed our view of the physical world . 
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before . 
Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time -- its smallness , its fragility . 
Forty years later , this group , more than most , are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment . 
And at last , we appear to be doing something about it . 
This destructive power takes many different forms . 
For example , these images taken by Brent Stirton in the Congo . 
These gorillas were murdered , some would even say crucified , and unsurprisingly , they sparked international outrage . 
Most recently , we 've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti . 
Well , I think what is far worse is man 's destructive power over man . 
Samuel Pisar , an Auschwitz survivor , said , and I 'll quote him , " The Holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . " 
There 's another kind of crucifixion . 
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact . 
The publication of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies . 
Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act . 
Furthermore , those images forever removed the so - called moral high ground of the occupying forces . 
Let 's go back a little . 
In the 1960s and 1970s , the Vietnam War was basically shown in America 's living rooms day in , day out . 
News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war : a little girl burned by napalm , a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest . 
In fact , these images became the voices of protest themselves . 
Now , images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion , ignorance , and in particular -- I 've given a lot of talks on this but I 'll just show one image -- the issue of HIV / AIDS . 
In the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it . 
A simple act , in 1987 , of the most famous woman in the world , the Princess of Wales , touching an HIV / AIDS infected baby did a great deal , especially in Europe , to stop that . 
She , better than most , knew the power of an image . 
So when we are confronted by a powerful image , we all have a choice : We can look away , or we can address the image . 
Thankfully , when these photos appeared in The Guardian in 1998 , they put a lot of focus and attention and , in the end , a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts . 
Did the images change the world ? 
No , but they had a major impact . 
Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other . 
We all saw those images after Katrina , and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact . 
And I think it 's very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November 2008 . 
Unfortunately , some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them . 
I 'll show you one photo here , and it 's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work , which has never been published , called War Is Personal . 
But images do n't need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war . 
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery . 
After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world , there 's one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still , much more than the others . 
Ansel Adams said , and I 'm going to disagree with him , " You do n't take a photograph , you make it . " 
In my view , it 's not the photographer who makes the photo , it 's you . 
We bring to each image our own values , our own belief systems , and as a result of that , the image resonates with us . 
My company has 70 million images . 
I have one image in my office . 
Here it is . 
I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you , you 'll better understand why , and I know that speaking to this audience , you 'll definitely do something about it . 
And thank you to all the photographers .

Ben Saunders skis to the North Pole 
This is me . My name is Ben Saunders . 
I specialize in dragging heavy things around cold places . 
On May 11th last year , I stood alone at the North geographic Pole . 
I was the only human being in an area one - and - a - half times the size of America , five - and - a - half thousand square miles . 
More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest . 
12 people have stood on the moon . 
Including me , only four people have skied solo to the North Pole . 
And I think the reason for that -- -- thank you -- I think the reason for that is that it 's -- it 's -- well , it 's as Chris said , bonkers . 
It 's a journey that is right at the limit of human capability . 
I skied the equivalent of 31 marathons back to back . 800 miles in 10 weeks . 
And I was dragging all the food I needed , the supplies , the equipment , sleeping bag , one change of underwear -- everything I needed for nearly three months . 
What we 're going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes I 've got left , is to try and answer three questions . The first one is , why ? 
The second one is , how do you go to the loo at minus 40 ? 
" Ben , I 've read somewhere that at minus 40 , exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute , so how do you answer the call of nature ? " 
I do n't want to answer these now . I 'll come on to them at the end . 
Third one : how do you top that ? What 's next ? 
It all started back in 2001 . 
My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -- enormously experienced chap . 
This was like my polar apprenticeship . 
We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here , Severnaya Zemlya , to the North Pole . 
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole , geographic North Pole , is that it 's slap bang in the middle of the sea . 
This is about as good as maps get , and to reach it you 've got to ski literally over the frozen crust , the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean . 
I 'd spoken to all the experts . 
I 'd read lots of books . I studied maps and charts . 
But I realized on the morning of day one that I had no idea exactly what I 'd let myself in for . 
I was 23 years old . No one my age had attempted anything like this , and pretty quickly , almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong . 
We were attacked by a polar bear on day two . 
I had frostbite in my left big toe . 
We started running very low on food . We were both pretty hungry , losing lots of weight . 
Some very unusual weather conditions , very difficult ice conditions . 
We had decidedly low - tech communications . 
We could n't afford a satellite phone , so we had HF radio . 
You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent . 
There 's a wire dangling down either side . 
That was our HF radio antenna . 
We had less than two hours two - way communication with the outside world in two months . 
Ultimately , we ran out of time . 
We 'd skied 400 miles . We were just over 200 miles left to go to the Pole , and we 'd run out of time . 
We were too late into the summer ; the ice was starting to melt ; we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio , and they said , " Look boys , you 've run out of time . 
We 've got to pick you up . " 
And I felt that I had failed , wholeheartedly . 
I was a failure . 
The one goal , the one dream I 'd had for as long as I could remember -- I had n't even come close . 
And skiing along that first trip , I had two imaginary video clips that I 'd replay over and over again in my mind when the going got tough , just to keep my motivation going . 
The first one was reaching the Pole itself . 
I could see vividly , I suppose , being filmed out of the door of a helicopter , there was , kind of , rock music playing in the background , and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack , you know , flying in the wind . 
I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole , you know -- ah , glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo . 
The second video clip that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport , and I could see again , vividly , the camera flashbulbs going off , the paparazzi , the autograph hunters , the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal . 
And of course , neither of these things happened . 
We did n't get to the Pole , and we did n't have any money to pay anyone to do the PR , so no one had heard of this expedition . 
And I got back to Heathrow . My mum was there ; my brother was there ; my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack -- -- and that was about it . I went back to live with my mum . 
I was physically exhausted , mentally an absolute wreck , considered myself a failure . 
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition , and lying on my mum 's sofa , day in day out , watching daytime TV . 
My brother sent me a text message , an SMS -- it was a quote from the " Simpsons . " It said , " You tried your hardest and failed miserably . 
The lesson is : do n't even try . " 
Fast forward three years . I did eventually get off the sofa , and start planning another expedition . This time , I wanted to go right across , on my own this time , from Russia , at the top of the map , to the North Pole , where the sort of kink in the middle is , and then on to Canada . 
No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own . 
Two Norwegians did it as a team in 2000 . No one 's done it solo . 
Very famous , very accomplished Italian mountaineer , Reinhold Messner , tried it in 1995 , and he was rescued after a week . 
He described this expedition as 10 times as dangerous as Everest . 
So for some reason , this was what I wanted to have a crack at , but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece , let alone make it across to Canada , I had to take a radical approach . 
This meant everything from perfecting the sawn - off , sub - two - gram toothbrush , to working with one of the world 's leading nutritionists in developing a completely new , revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch : 6,000 calories a day . 
And the expedition started in February last year . 
Big support team . We had a film crew , a couple of logistics people with us , my girlfriend , a photographer . 
At first it was pretty sensible . We flew British Airways to Moscow . 
The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk , on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir , spelled K - R - A - S. 
The next bit , we 'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane to fly us up to a town called Khatanga , which was the sort of last bit of civilization . 
Our cameraman , who it turned out was a pretty nervous flyer at the best of times , actually asked the pilot , before we got on the plane , how long this flight would take , and the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan , replied , " Six hours -- if we live . " 
We got to Khatanga . 
I think the joke is that Khatanga is n't the end of the world , but you can see it from there . 
It was supposed to be an overnight stay . We were stuck there for 10 days . 
There was a kind of vodka - fueled pay dispute between the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter , so we were stuck . We could n't move . 
Finally , morning of day 11 , we got the all - clear , loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem -- dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice . 
We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming , photography ; while the helicopter was still there , I did an interview on the satellite phone ; and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter , wham , the door closed , and I was alone . 
And I do n't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice . 
All I could think about was running back up to the door , banging on the door , and saying , " Look guys , I have n't quite thought this through . " 
To make things worse , you can just see the white dot up at the top right hand side of the screen ; that 's a full moon . 
Because we 'd been held up in Russia , of course , the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides ; when you 're standing on the frozen surface of the sea , high and low tides generally mean that interesting things are going to happen -- the ice is going to start moving around a bit . 
I was , you can see there , pulling two sledges . 
Grand total in all , 95 days of food and fuel , 180 kilos -- that 's almost exactly 400 pounds . 
When the ice was flat or flattish , I could just about pull both . 
When the ice was n't flat , I did n't have a hope in hell . 
I had to pull one , leave it , and go back and get the other one . 
Literally scrambling through what 's called pressure ice -- the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean , the wind and the tides . 
NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began . 
And it 's always drifting . The pack ice is always drifting . 
I was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year , and I was drifting backwards most of the time . 
My record was minus 2.5 miles . 
I got up in the morning , took the tent down , skied north for seven - and - a - half hours , put the tent up , and I was two and a half miles further back than when I 'd started . 
I literally could n't keep up with the drift of the ice . 
: So it 's day 22 . 
I 'm lying in the tent , getting ready to go . 
The weather is just appalling -- oh , drifted back about five miles in the last -- last night . 
Later in the expedition , the problem was no longer the ice . 
It was a lack of ice -- open water . 
I knew this was happening . I knew the Artic was warming . 
I knew there was more open water . And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve . 
This was my little bit of bio - mimicry . 
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines . 
If they come to water , they 'll climb in , swim across it . 
So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway -- based on a sort of survival suit -- I suppose , that helicopter pilots would wear -- that I could climb into . It would go on over my boots , over my mittens , it would pull up around my face , and seal pretty tightly around my face . 
And this meant I could ski over very thin ice , and if I fell through , it was n't the end of the world . 
It also meant , if the worst came to the worst , I could actually jump in and swim across and drag the sledge over after me . 
Some pretty radical technology , a radical approach --but it worked perfectly . 
Another exciting thing we did last year was with communications technology . 
In 1912 , Shackleton 's Endurance expedition -- there was -- one of his crew , a guy called Thomas Orde - Lees . 
He said , " The explorers of 2012 , if there is anything left to explore , will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones fitted with wireless telescopes . " 
Well , Orde - Lees guessed wrong by about eight years . This is my pocket wireless telephone , Iridium satellite phone . 
The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket . 
And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice , I was blogging live from my tent , sending back a little diary piece , sending back information on the distance I 'd covered -- the ice conditions , the temperature -- and a daily photo . 
Remember , 2001 , we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world . 
Last year , blogging live from an expedition that 's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest . 
It was n't all high - tech . This is navigating in what 's called a whiteout . 
When you get lots of mist , low cloud , the wind starts blowing the snow up . 
You ca n't see an awful lot . You can just see , there 's a yellow ribbon tied to one of my ski poles . 
I 'd navigate using the direction of the wind . 
So , kind of a weird combination of high - tech and low - tech . 
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May. 
It took me 68 days to get there from Russia , and there is nothing there . 
. 
There is n't even a pole at the Pole . There 's nothing there , purely because it 's sea ice . It 's drifting . 
Stick a flag there , leave it there , pretty soon it will drift off , usually towards Canada or Greenland . 
I knew this , but I was expecting something . 
Strange mixture of feelings : it was extremely warm by this stage , a lot of open water around , and of course , elated that I 'd got there under my own steam , but starting to really realize that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada , which was still 400 miles away , were slim at best . 
The only proof I 've got that I was there is a blurry photo of my GPS , the little satellite navigation gadget . 
You can just see -- there 's a nine and a string of zeros here . 
Ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole . 
I took a photo of that . Sat down on my sledge . Did a sort of video diary piece . 
Took a few photos . I got my satellite phone out . 
I warmed the battery up in my armpit . 
I dialed three numbers . I dialed my mum . 
I dialed my girlfriend . I dialed the CEO of my sponsor . 
And I got three voicemails . 
: Ninety . 
It 's a special feeling . 
The entire planet is rotating beneath my feet . 
The -- the whole world underneath me . 
I finally got through to my mum . She was at the queue of the supermarket . 
She started crying . She asked me to call her back . 
I skied on for a week past the Pole . 
I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue . 
This was the last day I had on the ice . 
When I spoke to the -- my project management team , they said , " Look , Ben , conditions are getting too dangerous . 
There are huge areas of open water just south of your position . 
We 'd like to pick you up . 
Ben , could you please look for an airstrip ? " 
This was the view outside my tent when I had this fateful phone call . 
I 'd never tried to build an airstrip before . Tony , the expedition manager , he said , " Look Ben , you 've got to find 500 meters of flat , thick safe ice . " 
The only bit of ice I could find -- it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip -- was exactly 473 meters . I could measure it with my skis . 
I did n't tell Tony that . I did n't tell the pilots that . 
I thought , it 'll have to do . 
: Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh . 
It just about worked . A pretty dramatic landing -- the plane actually passed over four times , and I was a bit worried it was n't going to land at all . 
The pilot , I knew , was called Troy . I was expecting someone called Troy that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy . 
I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment . 
So I thought , I 've got to compose myself for Troy . 
I 'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type . 
The plane taxied up to where I was standing . 
The door opened . This guy jumped out . He 's about that tall . He said , " Hi , my name is Troy . " 
. 
The co - pilot was a lady called Monica . 
She sat there in a sort of hand - knitted jumper . 
They were the least macho people I 've ever met , but they made my day . 
Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice ; we took a few photos . He climbed up the ladder . He said , " Just -- just get in the back . " 
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front , and I climbed in the back . 
Taxied up and down the runway a few times , just to flatten it out a bit , and he said , " Right , I 'm going to -- I 'm going to give it a go . " And he -- I 've now learned that this is standard practice , but it had me worried at the time . 
He put his hand on the throttle . 
You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit . 
It 's that little bar there . He put his hand on the throttle . 
Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his . 
I thought , " God , here we go . We 're , we 're -- this is all or nothing . " 
Rammed it forwards . Bounced down the runway . Just took off . 
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway , banking . I could see into the cockpit , Troy battling the controls , and he just took one hand off , reached back , flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit , and it was the " fasten seat belt " sign you can see on the wall . 
And only from the air did I see the big picture . 
Of course , when you 're on the ice , you only ever see one obstacle at a time , whether it 's a pressure ridge or there 's a bit of water . 
This is probably why I did n't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip . 
I mean , it really was starting to break up . 
Why ? I 'm not an explorer in the traditional sense . 
I 'm not skiing along drawing maps ; everyone knows where the North Pole is . 
At the South Pole there 's a big scientific base . There 's an airstrip . 
There 's a cafe and there 's a tourist shop . 
For me , this is about exploring human limits , about exploring the limits of physiology , of psychology and of technology . They 're the things that excite me . 
And it 's also about potential , on a personal level . 
This , for me , is a chance to explore the limits -- really push the limits of my own potential , see how far they stretch . 
And on a wider scale , it amazes me how people go through life just scratching the surface of their potential , just doing three or four or five percent of what they 're truly capable of . So , on a wider scale , I hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential , and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet . 
That 's as close as I can come to summing that up . 
The next question is , how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40 ? 
The answer , of course , to which is a trade secret -- and the last question , what 's next ? As quickly as possible , if I have a minute left at the end , I 'll go into more detail . 
What 's next : Antarctica . 
It 's the coldest , highest , windiest and driest continent on Earth . 
Late 1911 , early 1912 , there was a race to be the first to the South Pole : the heart of the Antarctic continent . 
If you include the coastal ice shelves , you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf -- it 's the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France . 
Antarctica , if you include the ice shelves , is twice the size of Australia -- it 's a big place . 
And there 's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen , the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies -- and Scott , the British guy , Captain Scott . 
Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors and a few dogs , all of which went wrong , and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot . 
They got to the Pole late January 1912 to find a Norwegian flag already there . 
There was a tent , a letter to the Norwegian king . 
And they turned around , headed back to the coast , and all five of them died on the return journey . 
Since then , no one has ever skied -- this was 93 years ago -- since then , no one has ever skied from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back . 
Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing -- no one has ever made a return journey . So that 's the plan . 
Two of us are doing it . 
That 's pretty much it . 
One final thought before I get to the toilet bit , is -- is , I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I 've forgotten -- but I have a -- I have a school report . I was 13 years old , and it 's framed above my desk at home . It says , " Ben lacks sufficient impetus to achieve anything worthwhile . " 
I think if I 've learned anything , it 's this : that no one else is the authority on your potential . 
You 're the only person that decides how far you go and what you 're capable of . 
Ladies and gentlemen , that 's my story . 
Thank you very much .

In this short talk , psychologist Dan Ariely tells two personal stories that explore scientific conflict of interest : How the pursuit of knowledge and insight can be affected , consciously or not , by shortsighted personal goals . When we 're thinking about the big questions , he reminds us , let 's be aware of our all - too - human brains .

Dan Ariely : Beware conflicts of interest 
So , I was in the hospital for a long time . 
And a few years after I left , I went back , and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me -- said , " Dan , I have a fantastic new treatment for you . " 
I was very excited . I walked with him to his office . 
And he explained to me that , when I shave , I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is , but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair , and this creates lack of symmetry . 
And what 's the brilliant idea he had ? 
He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric . 
It sounded interesting . He asked me to go and shave . 
Let me tell you , this was a strange way to shave , because I thought about it and I realized that the way I was shaving then would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life -- because I had to keep the width the same . 
When I got back to his office , I was n't really sure . 
I said , " Can I see some evidence for this ? " 
So he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots -- not very informative . 
I said , " What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white ? 
What would happen then ? " 
" Oh , do n't worry about it , " he said . 
" We have lasers ; we can whiten it out . " 
But I was still concerned , so I said , " You know what , I 'm not going to do it . " 
And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life . 
This is coming from a Jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot . 
And he said , " Dan , what 's wrong with you ? 
Do you enjoy looking non - symmetric ? 
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ? 
Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently ? " 
None of those happened . 
And this was very surprising to me , because I 've gone through many treatments -- there were many treatments I decided not to do -- and I never got this guilt trip to this extent . 
But I decided not to have this treatment . 
And I went to his deputy and asked him , " What was going on ? 
Where was this guilt trip coming from ? " 
And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already , and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing . 
Now you probably think that this guy 's a schmuck . 
Right , that 's what he seems like . 
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story . 
A few years ago , I was running some of my own experiments in the lab . 
And when we run experiments , we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another . 
So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high , another group that I thought their performance would be very low , and when I got the results , that 's what we got -- I was very happy -- aside from one person . 
There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly . 
And he pulled the whole mean down , destroying my statistical significance of the test . 
So I looked carefully at this guy . 
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample . 
And I remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy . 
" Fantastic ! " I thought . " Let 's throw him out . 
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? " 
But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , " What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ? 
What would have happened if he was in the other group ? 
Would we have thrown him out then ? " 
We probably would n't have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we 'd probably have said , " Fantastic ! What a smart guy who is performing this low , " because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower , giving us even stronger statistical results than we could . 
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment . 
But you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we 've done on conflicts of interest , basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me . 
The first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces . 
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased . 
And I 'm sure that it 's something that we all recognize , and we see that it happens . 
Maybe we do n't recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens . 
The most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives . 
And that 's a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account . 
Because we do n't see how conflicts of interest work on us . 
When I was doing these experiments , in my mind , I was helping science . 
I was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through . 
I was n't doing something bad . 
In my mind , I was actually a knight trying to help science move along . 
But this was not the case . 
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions . 
And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us , and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it , but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors , because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances . 
I do want to leave you with one positive thought . 
I mean , this is all very depressing , right -- people have conflicts of interest , we do n't see it , and so on . 
The positive perspective , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail , we can actually hope to fix things . 
And that , I think , is the hope . Thank you very much .

Imagine you 're a shipwrecked sailor adrift in the enormous Pacific . You can choose one of three directions and save yourself and your shipmates -- but each choice comes with a fearful consequence too . How do you choose ? In telling the story of the whaleship Essex , novelist Karen Thompson Walker shows how fear propels imagination , as it forces us to imagine the possible futures and how to cope with them . 
creativity , entertainment , storytelling 
1637 
Karen Thompson Walker : What fear can teach us 
One day in 1819 , 3,000 miles off the coast of Chile , in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean , 20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater . 
They 'd been struck by a sperm whale , which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship 's hull . 
As their ship began to sink beneath the swells , the men huddled together in three small whaleboats . 
These men were 10,000 miles from home , more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land . 
In their small boats , they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water . 
These were the men of the whaleship Essex , whose story would later inspire parts of " Moby Dick . " 
Even in today 's world , their situation would be really dire , but think about how much worse it would have been then . 
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong . 
No search party was coming to look for these men . 
So most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves , but we all know what it 's like to be afraid . 
We know how fear feels , but I 'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean . 
As we grow up , we 're often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness , just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates . 
And I think it 's no accident that we think this way . 
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard - wired to be optimists . 
So maybe that 's why we think of fear , sometimes , as a danger in and of itself . 
" Do n't worry , " we like to say to one another . " Do n't panic . " 
In English , fear is something we conquer . 
It 's something we fight . It 's something we overcome . 
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ? 
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination , something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself ? 
It 's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children , whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid . 
When I was a child , I lived in California , which is , you know , mostly a very nice place to live , but for me as a child , California could also be a little scary . 
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake , and I sometimes could n't sleep at night , terrified that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping . 
And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination . 
But at a certain point , most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up . 
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed , and not every earthquake brings buildings down . 
But maybe it 's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults . 
The same incredible imaginations that produced " The Origin of Species , " " Jane Eyre " and " The Remembrance of Things Past , " also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of Charles Darwin , Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust . 
So the question is , what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children ? 
Well let 's return to the year 1819 for a moment , to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex . 
Let 's take a look at the fears that their imaginations were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific . 
Twenty - four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship . 
The time had come for the men to make a plan , but they had very few options . 
In his fascinating account of the disaster , Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth . 
The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the Marquesas Islands , 1,200 miles away . 
But they 'd heard some frightening rumors . 
They 'd been told that these islands , and several others nearby , were populated by cannibals . 
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner . 
Another possible destination was Hawaii , but given the season , the captain was afraid they 'd be struck by severe storms . 
Now the last option was the longest , and the most difficult : to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of South America . 
But they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water . 
To be eaten by cannibals , to be battered by storms , to starve to death before reaching land . 
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died . 
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name . 
What if instead of calling them fears , we called them stories ? 
Because that 's really what fear is , if you think about it . 
It 's a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do . 
And fears and storytelling have the same components . 
They have the same architecture . 
Like all stories , fears have characters . 
In our fears , the characters are us . 
Fears also have plots . They have beginnings and middles and ends . 
You board the plane . The plane takes off . The engine fails . 
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel . 
Picture a cannibal , human teeth sinking into human skin , human flesh roasting over a fire . 
Fears also have suspense . 
If I 've done my job as a storyteller today , you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship Essex . 
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense . 
Just like all great stories , our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature : What will happen next ? 
In other words , our fears make us think about the future . 
And humans , by the way , are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way , of projecting ourselves forward in time , and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling . 
As a writer , I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event in a story will affect all the other events , and fear works in that same way . 
In fear , just like in fiction , one thing always leads to another . 
When I was writing my first novel , " The Age Of Miracles , " I spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down . 
What would happen to our days ? What would happen to our crops ? 
What would happen to our minds ? 
And then it was only later that I realized how very similar these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night . 
If an earthquake strikes tonight , I used to worry , what will happen to our house ? What will happen to my family ? 
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story . 
So if we think of our fears as more than just fears but as stories , we should think of ourselves as the authors of those stories . 
But just as importantly , we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears , and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives . 
Now , some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others . 
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs , and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called " productive paranoia , " which meant that these people , instead of dismissing their fears , these people read them closely , they studied them , and then they translated that fear into preparation and action . 
So that way , if their worst fears came true , their businesses were ready . 
And sometimes , of course , our worst fears do come true . 
That 's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear . 
Once in a while , our fears can predict the future . 
But we ca n't possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct . 
So how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others ? 
I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex offers an illuminating , if tragic , example . 
After much deliberation , the men finally made a decision . 
Terrified of cannibals , they decided to forgo the closest islands and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to South America . 
After more than two months at sea , the men ran out of food as they knew they might , and they were still quite far from land . 
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships , less than half of the men were left alive , and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism . 
Herman Melville , who used this story as research for " Moby Dick , " wrote years later , and from dry land , quote , " All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might in all human probability have been avoided had they , immediately after leaving the wreck , steered straight for Tahiti . 
But , " as Melville put it , " they dreaded cannibals . " 
So the question is , why did these men dread cannibals so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation ? 
Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other ? 
Looked at from this angle , theirs becomes a story about reading . 
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments , the artistic and the scientific . 
A good reader has an artist 's passion , a willingness to get caught up in the story , but just as importantly , the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist , which acts to temper and complicate the reader 's intuitive reactions to the story . 
As we 've seen , the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part . 
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios . 
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story . 
Of all the narratives their fears wrote , they responded only to the most lurid , the most vivid , the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture : cannibals . 
But perhaps if they 'd been able to read their fears more like a scientist , with more coolness of judgment , they would have listened instead to the less violent but the more likely tale , the story of starvation , and headed for Tahiti , just as Melville 's sad commentary suggests . 
And maybe if we all tried to read our fears , we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them . 
Maybe then we 'd spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes , and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face : the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries , the gradual changes in our climate . 
Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest , so too might our subtlest fears be the truest . 
Read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there 's still time to influence how that future will play out . 
Properly read , our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature : a little wisdom , a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth .

Armed with bracing logic , wit and her " public - health nerd " glasses , Elizabeth Pisani reveals the myriad of inconsistencies in today 's political systems that prevent our dollars from effectively fighting the spread of HIV . Her research with at - risk populations -- from junkies in prison to sex workers on the street in Cambodia -- demonstrates the sometimes counter - intuitive measures that could stall the spread of this devastating disease .

Elizabeth Pisani : Sex , drugs and HIV -- let 's get rational 
" People do stupid things . 
That 's what spreads HIV . " 
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper , The Guardian , not that long ago . 
I 'm curious , show of hands , who agrees with it ? 
Well , one or two brave souls . 
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who 's been in field of HIV for 15 years , worked on four continents , and you 're looking at her . 
And I am now going to argue that this is only half true . 
People do get HIV because they do stupid things , but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons . 
Now , " rational " is the dominant paradigm in public health , and if you put your public health nerd glasses on , you 'll see that if we give people the information that they need about what 's good for them and what 's bad for them , if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information , and a little bit of motivation , people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives . 
Wonderful . 
That 's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV , and although I 'm sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality , and if you were at TED ' 07 it 's about coffee prices ... 
Actually , HIV 's about sex and drugs , and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational , they are erections and addiction . 
So , let 's start with what 's rational for an addict . 
Now , I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine , Frankie . 
We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection . 
It was someone 's birthday , and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail , and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues . 
And so everyone lined up , all the smackheads in a row , and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit , and he went down and started injecting people . 
So he injects the first guy , and then he 's wiping the needle on his shirt , and he injects the next guy . 
And Frankie says , " I 'm number 22 in line , and I can see the needle coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place . 
It 's getting blunter and blunter . 
And a small part of my brain is thinking , ' That is so gross and really dangerous , ' but most of my brain is thinking , ' Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me . 
Please let there be some left . ' " And then , telling me this story , Frankie said , " You know ... God , drugs really make you stupid . " 
And , you know , you ca n't fault him for accuracy . 
But , actually , Frankie , at that time , was a heroin addict and he was in jail . 
So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high . 
And if there 's one place you really want to get high , it 's when you 're in jail . 
But I 'm a scientist and I do n't like to make data out of anecdotes , so let 's look at some data . 
We talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia , and we said , " Well , do you know how you get HIV ? " 
" Oh yeah , by sharing needles . " 
I mean , nearly 100 percent . Yeah , by sharing needles . 
And , " Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that ? " 
" Oh yeah . " Hundred percent . 
" We 're smackheads ; we know where to get clean needles . " 
" So are you carrying a needle ? " 
We 're actually interviewing people on the street , in the places where they 're hanging out and taking drugs . 
" Are you carrying clean needles ? " 
One in four , maximum . 
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10 , and the other nine in 10 are sharing . 
So you 've got this massive mismatch ; everyone knows that if they share they 're going to get HIV , but they 're all sharing anyway . 
So what 's that about ? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something ? 
We asked that to a junkie and they 're like , " Are you nuts ? " 
You do n't want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you 're sleeping with . 
There 's just kind of an ick factor there . 
" No , no . We share needles because we do n't want to go to jail . " 
So , in Indonesia at this time , if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up , they could put you into jail . 
And that changes the equation slightly , does n't it ? 
Because your choice now is either I use my own needle now , or I could share a needle now and get a disease that 's going to possibly kill me 10 years from now , or I could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow . 
And while junkies think that it 's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV , they think it 's a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they 'll probably end up in Frankie 's situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway . 
So , suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles . 
Now , let 's look at it from a policy maker 's point of view . 
This is a really easy problem . 
For once , your incentives are aligned . 
We 've got what 's rational for public health . 
You want people to use clean needles -- and junkies want to use clean needles . 
So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest . 
Now , the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well - known , bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher . 
And she put in the world 's first national needle exchange program , and other countries followed suit : Australia , The Netherlands and few others . 
And in all of those countries , you can see , not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV . 
Now , places that did n't do this -- New York City for example , Moscow , Jakarta -- we 're talking , at its peak , one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease . 
Now , Margaret Thatcher did n't do this because she has any great love for junkies . 
She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service . 
So , if she did n't invest in effective prevention , she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on , and obviously those are much higher . 
So she was making a politically rational decision . 
Now , if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data , it seems like a no - brainer , does n't it ? 
But in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , we 've taken a very different approach . 
So what we 've been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data . 
So , these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety - mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States , and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them . 
Now , the ones that show that needle programs are n't effective -- you think that 's one of these annoying dynamic slides and I 'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it 's going to come up , but no -- that 's the whole slide . 
There is nothing on the other side . 
So , completely irrational , you would think . 
Except that , wait a minute , politicians are rational , too , and they 're responding to what they think the voters want . 
So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this . 
So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors . 
Now let 's talk about sex . 
Are we any more rational about sex ? 
Well , I 'm not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church , who think somehow that if you give out condoms , everyone 's going to run out and have sex . 
I do n't know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online , but if you do , I 've got news for you Benedict -- I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid . 
It 's not that easy ! 
Here , maybe you 'll have better luck . 
Okay , seriously , HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually . 
So , it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids . 
And what we 've got is a very , very high level of virus right at the beginning when you 're first infected , then you start making antibodies , and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time -- 10 or 12 years -- you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection . 
But basically , nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS , and by that stage , you 're not looking great , you 're not feeling great , you 're not having that much sex . 
So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia . 
Now , this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups , and that 's considered stigmatizing . 
I 've always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing , whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing , but we 'll leave that be . 
The truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time . 
And those groups are , globally , people who sell sex and their more regular partners . 
They are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more partners than straight people on the party scene . 
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa . 
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today . 
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa . 
These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven , and one in three of all adults , are infected with HIV . 
Now , in the rest of the world , we 've got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very , very low levels -- but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk : drug injectors , sex workers and gay men . 
And you 'll note , that 's the local data from Los Angeles : 25 percent prevalence among gay men . 
Of course , you ca n't get HIV just by having unprotected sex . 
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person . 
In most of the world , these few prevention failures notwithstanding , we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex : condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries . 
And , again , it 's because of an alignment of the incentives . 
What 's rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it 's really bad for business to have another STI . 
No one wants it . 
And , actually , clients do n't want to go home with a drip either . 
So essentially , you 're able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex . 
But in " intimate " relations it 's much more difficult because , with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things , we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy , and nothing is quite so unromantic as the , " My condom or yours , darling ? " question . 
So in the face of that , you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms . 
This , for example , this gentleman is called Joseph . 
He 's from Haiti and he has AIDS . 
And he 's probably not having a lot of sex right now , but he is a reminder in the population , of why you might want to be using condoms . 
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex , perhaps . 
Now , funnily enough , this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment . 
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect . 
But it is changing the equation of what 's rational in sexual decision - making . 
So , what we 've got -- some people say , " Oh , it does n't matter very much because , actually , treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV . " 
So , if you look at the viremia thing again , if you do start treatment when you 're sick , well , what happens ? Your viral load comes down . 
But compared to what ? What happens if you 're not on treatment ? 
Well , you die , so your viral load goes to zero . 
And all of this green stuff here , including the spikes -- which are because you could n't get to the pharmacy , or you ran out of drugs , or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs , or because you 've started to get resistance , or whatever -- all of that is virus that would n't be out there , except for treatment . 
Now , am I saying , " Oh , well , great prevention strategy . 
Let 's just stop treating people . " 
Of course not , of course not . 
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can . 
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need . 
That 's simply not necessarily true , and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now . 
And what we 've seen is that , actually , condom use rates , which were very , very high -- the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV , with extremely little help from public health nerds , I would say -- that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really : One is the assumption of , " Oh well , if he 's infected , he 's probably on meds , and his viral load 's going to be low , so I 'm pretty safe . " 
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS , and rightly so . 
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you , and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day . 
And that 's boring , but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex , no matter how drunk you are , no matter how many poppers you 've taken , whatever ? 
If we look at the data , we can see that the answer to that question is , mmm . 
So these are data from Scotland . 
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program . 
Then it came way down . 
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users , you 've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins , and that 's because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier . 
But in gay men , you 've got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available . 
This is of new infections . 
What does that mean ? 
It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -- more people living longer , healthier lives , more likely to be getting laid with HIV -- is outweighing the effects of lower viral load , and that 's a very worrisome thing . 
What does it mean ? 
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have . 
Is that what 's happening ? 
No , and I call it the " compassion conundrum . " 
We 've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days , and what 's happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers , unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies . 
But once they 've gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we do n't want to condone to being AIDS victims , we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives . 
It does n't make any sense from a public health point of view . 
I want to give what 's very nearly the last word to Ines . 
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta ; she 's a chick with a dick . 
Why does she do that job ? 
Well , of course , because she 's forced into it because she does n't have any better option , etc . , etc . 
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory , all would be well . 
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia : on average , 20 cents . 
It varies a bit province to province . 
I do speak to sex workers , 15,000 of them for this particular slide , and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour . 
So it 's not a great job , but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice . 
Okay , Ines . 
We 've got the tools , the knowledge and the cash , and commitment to preventing HIV too . 
Ines : So why is prevalence still rising ? 
It 's all politics . 
When you get to politics , nothing makes sense . 
Elizabeth Pisani : " When you get to politics , nothing makes sense . " 
So , from the point of view of a sex worker , politicians are making no sense . 
From the point of view of a public health nerd , junkies are doing dumb things . 
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale . 
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that 's one of the glories of human existence . 
But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another , so it 's rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that 's made by a politician , and it 's rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they 're responding to what they think the voters want . 
But here 's the thing : we are the voters . 
We 're not all of them , of course , but TED is a community of opinion leaders . 
And everyone who 's in this room , and everyone who 's watching this out there on the web , I think , has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense . 
It 's going to be really hard for us to individually affect what 's rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there , but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV . 
Thank you .

As a democratic revolution led by tech - empowered young people sweeps the Arab world , Wadah Khanfar , the head of Al Jazeera , shares a profoundly optimistic view of what 's happening in Egypt , Tunisia , Libya and beyond -- at this powerful moment when people realized they could step out of their houses and ask for change . 
global issues , iraq , media , politics , technology 
1084 
Wadah Khanfar : A historic moment in the Arab world 
Ten years ago exactly , I was in Afghanistan . 
I was covering the war in Afghanistan , and I witnessed , as a reporter for Al Jazeera , the amount of suffering and destruction that emerged out of a war like that . 
Then , two years later , I covered another war -- the war in Iraq . 
I was placed at the center of that war because I was covering the war from the northern part of Iraq . 
And the war ended with a regime change , like the one in Afghanistan . 
And that regime that we got rid of was actually a dictatorship , an authoritarian regime , that for decades created a great sense of paralysis within the nation , within the people themselves . 
However , the change that came through foreign intervention created even worse circumstances for the people and deepened the sense of paralysis and inferiority in that part of the world . 
For decades , we have lived under authoritarian regimes -- in the Arab world , in the Middle East . 
These regimes created something within us during this period . 
I 'm 43 years old right now . 
For the last 40 years , I have seen almost the same faces for kings and presidents ruling us -- old , aged , authoritarian , corrupt situations -- regimes that we have seen around us . 
And for a moment I was wondering , are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground , a change that does not come through foreign intervention , through the misery of occupation , through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes ? 
The Iraqis : yes , they got rid of Saddam Hussein , but when they saw their land occupied by foreign forces they felt very sad , they felt that their dignity had suffered . 
And this is why they revolted . 
This is why they did not accept . 
And actually other regimes , they told their citizens , " Would you like to see the situation of Iraq ? 
Would you like to see civil war , sectarian killing ? 
Would you like to see destruction ? 
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land ? " 
And the people thought for themselves , " Maybe we should live with this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in , instead of having the second scenario . " 
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen . 
For 10 years , unfortunately we have found ourselves reporting images of destruction , images of killing , of sectarian conflicts , images of violence , emerging from a magnificent piece of land , a region that one day was the source of civilizations and art and culture for thousands of years . 
Now I am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived . 
A new generation , well - educated , connected , inspired by universal values and a global understanding , has created a new reality for us . 
We have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams : these young people who have restored self - confidence in our nations in that part of the world , who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets . 
Nothing happened . No violence . Nothing . 
Just step out of your house , raise your voice and say , " We would like to see the end of the regime . " 
This is what happened in Tunisia . 
Over a few days , the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars in the security agencies , billions of dollars in maintaining , trying to maintain , its prisons , collapsed , disappeared , because of the voices of the public . 
People who were inspired to go down to the streets and to raise their voices , they tried to kill . 
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people . 
They found something called Facebook . 
They found something called Twitter . 
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues . 
And they said , " These kids are misled . " 
Therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home . 
This is what they were telling . This is their propaganda . 
" Bring these kids home because they are misled . " 
But yes , these youth who have been inspired by universal values , who are idealistic enough to imagine a magnificent future and , at the same time , realistic enough to balance this kind of imagination and the process leading to it -- not using violence , not trying to create chaos -- these young people , they did not go home . 
Parents actually went to the streets and they supported them . 
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia . 
We in Al Jazeera were banned from Tunisia for years , and the government did not allow any Al Jazeera reporter to be there . 
But we found that these people in the street , all of them are our reporters , feeding our newsroom with pictures , with videos and with news . 
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha became a center that received all this kind of input from ordinary people -- people who are connected and people who have ambition and who have liberated themselves from the feeling of inferiority . 
And then we took that decision : We are unrolling the news . 
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people . 
We are going to spread the message . 
Yes , some of these young people are connected to the Internet , but the connectivity in the Arab world is very little , is very small , because of many problems that we are suffering from . 
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people and we amplified [ it ] . 
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world -- and internationally , globally , through our English channel . 
And then people started to feel that there 's something new happening . 
And then Zine al - Abidine Ben Ali decided to leave . 
And then Egypt started , and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave . 
And now Libya as you see it . 
And then you have Yemen . 
And you have many other countries trying to see and to rediscover that feeling of , " How do we imagine a future which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant ? " 
I want to tell you something , that the Internet and connectivity has created [ a ] new mindset . 
But this mindset has continued to be faithful to the soil and to the land that it emerged from . 
And while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was imposed on us , and people rejected that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture . 
Always , we believed that change will spring from within , that change should be a reconciliation with culture , cultural diversity , with our faith in our tradition and in our history , but at the same time , open to universal values , connected with the world , tolerant to the outside . 
And this is the moment that is happening right now in the Arab world . 
This is the right moment , and this is the actual moment that we see all of these meanings meet together and then create the beginning of this magnificent era that will emerge from the region . 
How did the elite deal with that -- the so - called political elite ? 
In front of Facebook , they brought the camels in Tahrir Square . 
In front of Al Jazeera , they started creating tribalism . 
And then when they failed , they started speaking about conspiracies that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington in order to divide the Arab world . 
They started telling the West , " Be aware of Al - Qaeda . 
Al - Qaeda is taking over our territories . 
These are Islamists trying to create new Imaras . 
Be aware of these people who [ are ] coming to you in order to ruin your great civilization . " 
Fortunately , people right now can not be deceived . 
Because this corrupt elite in that region has lost even the power of deception . 
They could not , and they can not , imagine how they could really deal with this reality . 
They have lost . 
They have been detached from their people , from the masses , and now we are seeing them collapsing one after the other . 
Al Jazeera is not a tool of revolution . 
We do not create revolutions . 
However , when something of that magnitude happens , we are at the center of the coverage . 
We were banned from Egypt , and our correspondents , some of them were arrested . 
But most of our camera people and our journalists , they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily -- to report what happened in Tahrir Square . 
For 18 days , our cameras were broadcasting , live , the voices of the people in Tahrir Square . 
I remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who I do n't know -- from Tahrir Square . 
He told me , " We appeal to you not to switch off the cameras . 
If you switch off the cameras tonight , there will be a genocide . 
You are protecting us by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square . " 
I felt the responsibility to phone our correspondents there and to phone our newsroom and to tell them , " Make your best not to switch off the cameras at night , because the guys there really feel confident when someone is reporting their story -- and they feel protected as well . " 
So we have a chance to create a new future in that part of the world . 
We have a chance to go and to think of the future as something which is open to the world . 
Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran , of [ the ] Mosaddeq revolution . 
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West -- from thinking about that part of the world based on oil interest , or based on interests of the illusion of stability and security . 
The stability and security of authoritarian regimes can not create but terrorism and violence and destruction . 
Let us accept the choice of the people . 
Let us not pick and choose who we would like to rule their future . 
The future should be ruled by people themselves , even sometimes if they are voices that might now scare us . 
But the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world , for the West and the East , to see stability and to see security and to see friendship and to see tolerance emerging from the Arab world , rather than the images of violence and terrorism . 
Let us support these people . 
Let us stand for them . 
And let us give up our narrow selfishness in order to embrace change , and in order to celebrate with the people of that region a great future and hope and tolerance . 
The future has arrived , and the future is now . 
I thank you very much . 
Thank you very much . 
Chris Anderson : I just have a couple of questions for you . 
Thank you for coming here . 
How would you characterize the historical significance of what 's happened ? 
Is this a story - of - the - year , a story - of - the - decade or something more ? 
Wadah Khanfar : Actually , this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered . 
We have covered many wars . 
We have covered a lot of tragedies , a lot of problems , a lot of conflict zones , a lot of hot spots in the region , because we were centered at the middle of it . 
But this is a story -- it is a great story ; it is beautiful . 
It is not something that you only cover because you have to cover a great incident . 
You are witnessing change in history . 
You are witnessing the birth of a new era . 
And this is what the story 's all about . 
CA : There are a lot of people in the West who are still skeptical , or think this may just be an intermediate stage before much more alarming chaos . 
You really believe that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now , that a government could emerge that espouses some of the values you 've spoken about so inspiringly ? 
WK : And people actually , after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime , the youth who have organized themselves in certain groups and councils , they are guarding the transformation and they are trying to put it on a track in order to satisfy the values of democracy , but at the same time also to make it reasonable and to make it rational , not to go out of order . 
In my opinion , these people are much more wiser than , not only the political elite , even the intellectual elite , even opposition leaders including political parties . 
At this moment in time , the youth in the Arab world are much more wiser and capable of creating the change than the old -- including the political and cultural and ideological old regimes . 
CA : We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way . 
What should people here at TED , here in the West , do if they want to connect or make a difference and they believe in what 's happening here ? 
WK : I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world -- that people care , people care about this great transformation . 
Mohamed Nanabhay who 's sitting with us , the head of Aljazeera.net , he told me that a 2,500 percent increase of accessing our website from various parts of the world . 
Fifty percent of it is coming from America . 
Because we discovered that people care , and people would like to know -- they are receiving the stream through our Internet . 
Unfortunately in the United States , we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time for Al Jazeera English . 
But I can tell you , this is the moment to celebrate through connecting ourselves with those people in the street and expressing our support to them and expressing this kind of feeling , universal feeling , of supporting the weak and the oppressed to create a much better future for all of us . 
CA : Well Wadah , a group of members of the TED community , TEDxCairo , are meeting as we speak . 
They 've had some speakers there . 
I believe they 've heard your talk . 
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us . 
Thank you so much .

This is Aunt Zip from Sodom , North Carolina . 
She was 105 years old when I took this picture . 
She was always saying things that made me stop and think , like , " Time may be a great healer , but it ai n't no beauty specialist . " 
She said , " Be good to your friends . 
Why , without them , you 'd be a total stranger . " 
This is one of her songs . 
Let 's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together . 
And I 'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me . 
Give him a big old hand . 
One , two , three , four . 
Well , my true love 's a black - eyed daisy ; if I do n't see her , I go crazy . 
My true love lives up the river ; a few more jumps and I 'll be with her . 
Hey , hey , black - eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black - eyed Susie ! 
Hey , hey black - eyed Susie , hey . 
Now you 've got to picture Aunt Zip at 105 years old in Sodom , North Carolina . 
I 'd go up and learn these old songs from her . 
She could n't sing much , could n't play anymore . 
And I 'd pull her out on the front porch . 
Down below , there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule . 
A double outhouse over here on the side . 
And we 'd sing this old song . She did n't have a whole lot of energy , so I 'd sing , " Hey , hey ! " and she 'd just answer back with , " Black - eyed Susie . " 
Oh , hey , hey , black - eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black - eyed Susie ! 
Hey , hey , black - eyed Susie , hey . 
Well , she and I went blackberry picking . 
She got mad ; I took a licking . 
Ducks on the millpond , geese in the ocean , Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion . 
Hey , hey , black - eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black - eyed Susie ! 
Hey , hey black - eyed Susie , hey . 
Let 's have the banjo . 
Well , we 'll get married next Thanksgiving . 
I 'll lay around ; she 'll make a living . 
She 'll cook blackjacks , I 'll cook gravy ; we 'll have chicken someday , maybe . 
Hey , hey , hey , hey . Hey , hey , black - eyed Susie , hey ! 
One more time now . 
Oh , hey , hey , black - eyed Susie ! Hey , hey , black - eyed Susie ! 
Hey , hey , black - eyed Susie , hey . 
Thank you , Michael . 
This is Ralph Stanley . 
When I was going to college at University of California at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies , taking majors in biology and art , he came to the campus . 
This was in 1968 , I guess it was . 
And he played his bluegrass style of music , but near the end of the concert , he played the old timing style of banjo picking that came from Africa , along with the banjo . 
It 's called claw - hammer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother . 
I fell in love with that . 
I went up to him and said , how can I learn that ? 
He said , well , you can go back to Clinch Mountain , where I 'm from , or Asheville or Mount Airy , North Carolina -- some place that has a lot of music . 
Because there 's a lot of old people still living that play that old style . 
So I went back that very summer . 
I just fell in love with the culture and the people . 
And you know , I came back to school , I finished my degrees and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player . 
You can imagine how excited they were . 
So I thought I would just like to show you some of the pictures I 've taken of some of my mentors . 
Just a few of them , but maybe you 'll get just a little hint of some of these folks . 
And play a little banjo . Let 's do a little medley . 
Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks , who just passed away last year . 
He was one of the great American folk tale - tellers . 
The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this , you could hardly understand him . But it was really wonderful . 
And he lived in that house that his great - grandfather had built . 
No running water , no electricity . A wonderful , wonderful guy . 
And you can look at more pictures . 
I 've actually got a website that 's got a bunch of photos that I 've done of some of the other folks I did n't get a chance to show you . 
This instrument came up in those pictures . It 's called the mouth bow . 
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world , and still played in the Southern mountains . 
Now , the old timers did n't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this . 
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up . 
It was hard on the cats , but it made a great little instrument . 
It sounds something like this . 
Well , have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys ? 
You take Kate , I 'll take Sal ; we 'll both have a Johnson gal . 
You take Kate , I 'll take Sal ; we 'll both have a Johnson gal . 
Now , they were scouts in the rebels ' army , they were known both far and wide . 
When the Yankees saw them coming , they 'd lay down their guns and hide . 
You take Kate , I 'll take Sal ; we 'll both have a Johnson gal . 
You take Kate , I 'll take Sal ; we 'll both have a Johnson gal . 
Ai n't that a sound ? 
Well , it was 1954 , I guess it was . 
We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville , Texas , where I grew up in the early part of my life . 
Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store . 
My mom was driving ; my brother and I were in the back seat . 
We were really mad at my mom . We looked out the window . 
We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields . 
You see , we 'd just been to the grocery store , and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it . 
And , buddy , that made us mad . 
Well , my mom did n't put up with much either , and she was driving , and she said , " You boys ! You think you can have anything you want . 
You do n't know how hard it is to earn money . Your dad works so hard . 
You think money grows on trees . You 've never worked a day in your lives . 
You boys make me so mad . You 're going to get a job this summer . " 
She pulled the car over ; she said , " Get out of the car . " 
My brother and I stepped out of the car . 
We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton . 
There were about a hundred black folks out there picking . 
My mom grabbed us by the shoulders . She marched us out in the field . 
She went up to the foreman ; she said , " I 've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives . " 
Of course , we were just eight and 10 . 
She said , " Would you put them to work ? " 
Well , that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman : put these two middle - class little white boys out in a cotton field in August in Texas -- it 's hot . 
So he gave us each a cotton sack , about 10 feet long , about that big around , and we started picking . 
Now , cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers . 
And if you do n't know what you 're doing , your hands are bleeding in no time . 
And my brother and I started to pick it , and our hands were startin ' to bleed , and then -- " Mom ! " 
And Mom was just sitting by the car like this . 
She was n't going to give up . 
Well , the foreman could see he was in over his head , I guess . 
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice . 
He just sang : " Well , there 's a long white robe in heaven , I know . 
Do n't want it to leave me behind . 
Well , there 's a long white robe in heaven , I know . 
Do n't want it to leave me behind . " 
And from all around as people started singing and answering back , he sang : " Good news , good news : Chariot 's coming . 
Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
And I do n't want it to leave me behind . " 
Now , my brother and I had never heard anything like that in our whole lives . It was so beautiful . 
We sat there all day picking cotton , without complaining , without crying , while they sang things like : " Oh , Mary , do n't you weep , do n't you moan " and " Wade in the water , " and " I done done , " " This little light of mine . " 
Finally , by the end of the day , we 'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton . 
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar , but my mother would never let us cash it . 
I 'm 57 ; still have the check . 
Now , my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work . 
But if you have children , you know it does n't often work that way . 
No , we learned something else . 
The first thing I learned that day was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again . 
And pretty much never did . 
But I also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day , and that was an eye - opener . 
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier . 
And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can . 
Now , I was just a little eight - year - old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field . 
I was n't even aware of music -- not even aware of it . 
But that day in the cotton field out there picking , when those people started singing , I realized I was in the very heart of real music , and that 's where I 've wanted to be ever since . 
Try this old song with me . I sing : Well , there 's a long white robe in heaven , I know . 
You sing : Do n't want it to leave me behind . 
Well , there 's a long white robe in heaven , I know . 
Do n't want it to leave me behind . 
Good news , good news : Chariot 's coming . 
Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
And I do n't want it to leave me -- It 's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton , is n't it ? 
Let 's try it one more time . 
There 's a starry crown in heaven , I know . 
Do n't want it to leave me behind . 
There 's a starry crown in heaven , I know . 
Do n't want it to leave me behind . 
Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
And I do n't want it to leave me behind . 
It was a few years ago , but I sort of remembered this story , and I told it at a concert . 
My mom was in the audience . 
After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself , of course , but after the concert she came up and she said , " David , I 've got to tell you something . 
I set that whole thing up . 
I set it up with the foreman . I set it up with the owner of the land . 
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work . 
I did n't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though . " 
Let 's try . Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
Good news : Chariot 's coming . 
And I do n't want it to leave me behind . 
Well , this is the steel guitar . It 's an American - made instrument . 
It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers , who later on made the Dobro , which is a wood - bodied instrument with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from . 
It 's usually played flat on your lap . 
It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s , before they had electric guitars , trying to make a loud guitar . 
And then African - American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck , just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well . 
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect . 
Break it off , put it on your finger , and slide into the notes . 
This instrument pretty much saved my life . 
Fifteen years ago , 14 years ago , I guess , this year , my wife and I lost our daughter , Sarah Jane , in a car accident , and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world . 
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief , just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in . 
I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive . 
I had to sit down and make lists , because I was ready to go ; I was ready to check out of this world . 
And you know , at the top of the list , of course , were Jenny , and my son , Zeb , my parents -- I did n't want to hurt them . 
But then , when I thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things . 
I did n't care about -- I had a radio show , I have a radio show on public radio , " Riverwalk , " I did n't care about that . I did n't care about awards or money or anything . 
Nothing . Nothing . 
On the list it would be stuff like , seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring , the smell of new - mown hay , catching a wave and bodysurfing , the touch of a baby 's hand , the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar , listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon . 
And for me , the sound of a steel guitar , because one of my parents ' neighbors just gave me one of these things . 
And I would sit around with it , and I did n't know how to play it , but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play . 
And it was the only instrument that , of all the ones that I play , that would really make that connection . 
This is a song that came out of that . 
Well , I hear you 're having trouble . 
Lord , I hate to hear that news . 
If you want to talk about it , you know , I will listen to you through . 
Words no longer say it ; let me tell you what I always do . 
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues . 
People say , " Oh , snap out of it ! " 
Oh yeah , that 's easier said than done . 
While you can hardly move , they 're running around having all kinds of fun . 
Sometimes I think it 's better just to sink way down in your funky mood ' til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues . 
Now , you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes , but you know that 's not going to get you where you want to get . 
But I got some medicine here that just might shake things loose . 
Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues . 
Open up now . 
Oh , I think I 've got time to tell you about this . My dad was an inventor . 
We moved to California when Sputnik went up , in 1957 . 
And he was working on gyroscopes ; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing . 
And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney . 
They were about my age . 
John went on , and Michael did too , to become some of the inventors of computer animation . 
Michael 's dad was working on something called the computer . 
This was 1957 , I was a little 10-year - old kid ; I did n't know what that was . But he took me down to see one , you know , what they were making . It was like a library , just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see , just floors and floors of these things , and one of the engineers said , some day you 're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket . 
I thought , damn , those are going to be some big pants ! 
So that Christmas -- maybe I 've got time for this -- that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun - o - Rama chemistry set . 
Well , I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad ; so did Michael . 
His great - granddad had been Eli Whitney , the inventor of the cotton gin . 
So we looked in that -- this was a commercial chemistry set . 
It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see : sulfur , potassium nitrate and charcoal . 
Man , we were only 10 , but we knew that made gunpowder . 
We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew , it flared up . Ah , it was great . 
Well , obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon . 
So we went over into Michael 's garage -- his dad had all kinds of stuff , and we put a pipe in the vice there , and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe , drilled a hole in the back of the pipe , took some of our firecrackers , pulled out the fuses , tied them together , put them in the back there , and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top , in the garage . 
We were n't stupid : we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it . 
We stood back , we lit that thing , and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper . 
Through the garage . 
Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen . 
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard . 
That was Pacific Palisades ; it probably is still there , back there . 
Well , my brother heard that we had made gunpowder . 
He and his buddies , they were older , and they were pretty mean . 
They said they were going to beat us up if we did n't make some gunpowder for them . 
We said , well , what are you going to do with it ? 
They said , we 're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel . 
Sure . We 'll make you a big batch . 
So we made them a big batch , and it was in my -- now , we 'd just moved here . We 'd just moved to California . 
Mom had redone the kitchen ; Mom was gone that day . We had a pie tin . 
It became Chris Berquist 's job to do the melting down . 
Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen . 
He said , " Yeah , hey , it 's melting . Yeah , the sulfur 's melting . 
No problem . Yeah , you know . " 
It just flared up , and he turned around , and he looked like this . 
No hair , no eyelashes , no nothing . 
There were big welts all over my mom 's kitchen cabinet ; the air was the just full of black smoke . 
She came home , she took that chemistry set away , and we never saw it again . 
But we thought of it often , because every time she 'd cook tuna surprise it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder . 
So I like to invent things too , and I think I 'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back . 
When drum machines were new , I got to thinking , why could n't you take the oldest form of music , the hambone rhythms , and combine it with the newest technology ? 
I call this Thunderwear . 
At that time , drum triggers were new . 
And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit . 
I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday ; I 'm going to be doing some of the same ones . 
I have a trigger here , trigger here , here , here . Right there . 
It 's going to really hurt if I do n't take that off . Okay . 
Now , the drum triggers go out my tail here , into the drum machine , and they can make various sounds , like drums . 
So let me put them all together . And also , I can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this . 
Thank you , folks .

Stefan Sagmeister : The power of time off 
I run a design studio in New York . 
Every seven years , I close it for one year to pursue some little experiments , things that are always difficult to accomplish during the regular working year . 
In that year , we are not available for any of our clients . 
We are totally closed . 
And as you can imagine , it is a lovely and very energetic time . 
I originally had opened the studio in New York to combine my two loves , music and design . 
And we created videos and packaging for many musicians that you know , and for even more that you 've never heard of . 
As I realized , just like with many many things in my life that I actually love , I adapt to it . 
And I get , over time , bored by them . 
And for sure , in our case , our work started to look the same . 
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book . 
Quite the similar idea , then , a perfume packaged in a book , in a die cut . 
So I decided to close it down for one year . 
Also is the knowledge that right now we spend about in the first 25 years of our lives learning , then there is another 40 years that 's really reserved for working . 
And then tacked on at the end of it are about 15 years for retirement . 
And I thought it might be helpful to basically cut off five of those retirement years and intersperse them in between those working years . 
That 's clearly enjoyable for myself . 
But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large , rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two . 
There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago , Jonathan Haidt , who defined his work into three different levels . 
And they rang very true for me . 
I can see my work as a job . I do it for money . 
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays . 
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism . 
In a career I 'm definitely more engaged . 
But at the same time , there will be periods when I think is all that really hard work really worth my while ? 
While in the third one , in the calling , very much likely I would do it also if I would n't be financially compensated for it . 
I am not a religious person myself , but I did look for nature . 
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City . 
Looked for something different for the second one . 
Europe and the U.S. did n't really feel enticing because I knew them too well . So Asia it was . 
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia were Sri Lanka and Bali . 
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on , so Bali it was . 
It 's a wonderful , very craft - oriented society . 
I arrived there in September 2008 , and pretty much started to work right away . 
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself . 
However the first thing that I needed was mosquito repellent typography because they were definitely around heavily . 
And then I needed some sort of way to be able to get back to all the wild dogs that surround my house , and attacked me during my morning walks . 
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts . 
Every single dog on one tee shirt . 
As a little retaliation with a just ever so slightly menacing message on the back of the shirt . 
Just before I left New York I decided I could actually renovate my studio . 
And then just leave it all to them . 
And I do n't have to do anything . 
So I looked for furniture . 
And it turned out that all the furniture that I really liked , I could n't afford . 
And all the stuff I could afford , I did n't like . 
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali was pieces of furniture . 
This one , of course , still works with the wild dogs . 
It 's not quite finished yet . 
And I think by the time this lamp came about , I had finally made peace with those dogs . 
Then there is a coffee table . I also did a coffee table . 
It 's called Be Here Now . 
It includes 330 compasses . 
And we had custom espresso cups made that hide a magnet inside , and make those compasses go crazy , always centering on them . 
Then this is a fairly talkative , verbose kind of chair . 
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali . 
And at the same time , I 'm extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people 's happinesses . 
So I will not really go too far into it . 
Many of you will know this TEDster , Danny Gilbert , whose book , actually , I got it through the TED book club . 
I think it took me four years to finally read it , while on sabbatical . 
And I was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical . 
And I 'll show you a couple of people that did well by pursuing sabbaticals . 
This is Ferran Adria . Many people think he is right now the best chef in the world with his restaurant north of Barcelona , El Bulli . 
His restaurant is open seven months every year . 
He closes it down for five months to experiment with a full kitchen staff . 
His latest numbers are fairly impressive . 
He can seat , throughout the year , he can seat 8,000 people . 
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations . 
If I look at my cycle , seven years , one year sabbatical , it 's 12.5 percent of my time . 
And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine , 3 M since the 1930s is giving all their engineers 15 percent to pursue whatever they want . 
There is some good successes . 
Scotch tape came out of this program , as well as Art Fry developed sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M. 
Google , of course , very famously gives 20 percent for their software engineers to pursue their own personal projects . 
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical ? 
That 's about five percent of everybody . 
So I 'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up . 
Talk to them about if it was successful or not . 
I 've found that finding out about what I 'm going to like in the future , my very best way is to talk to people who have actually done it much better than myself envisioning it . 
When I had the idea of doing one , the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book . 
And then I told as many , many people as I possibly could about it so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on . 
In the beginning , on the first sabbatical , it was rather disastrous . 
I had thought that I should do this without any plan , that this vacuum of time somehow would be wonderful and enticing for idea generation . It was not . 
I just , without a plan , I just reacted to little requests , not work requests , those I all said no to , but other little requests . 
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that . 
So I became my own intern . 
And I very quickly made a list of the things I was interested in , put them in a hierarchy , divided them into chunks of time and then made a plan , very much like in grade school . 
What does it say here ? Monday , 8 to 9 : story writing ; 9 to 10 : future thinking . 
Was not very successful . And so on and so forth . 
And that actually , specifically as a starting point of the first sabbatical , worked really well for me . 
What came out of it ? 
I really got close to design again . 
I had fun . 
Financially , seen over the long term , it was actually successful . 
Because of the improved quality , we could ask for higher prices . 
And probably most importantly , basically everything we 've done in the seven years following the first sabbatical came out of thinking of that one single year . 
And I 'll show you a couple of projects that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical . 
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was that sameness is so incredibly overrated . 
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same works for a very very few strand of companies , and not for everybody else . 
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica , the Rem Koolhaas - built music center in Porto , in Portugal . 
And even though I desired to do an identity that does n't use the architecture , I failed at that . 
And mostly also because I realized out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto , where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning . 
Which I understood after I translated it from architecture speech in to regular English , basically as logo making . 
And I understood that the building itself was a logo . 
So then it became quite easy . 
We put a mask on it , looked at it deep down in the ground , checked it out from all sides , west , north , south , east , top and bottom . 
Colored them in a very particular way by having a friend of mine write a piece of software , the Casa da Musica Logo Generator . 
That 's connected to a scanner . 
You put any image in there , like that Beethoven image . 
And the software , in a second , will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo . 
Which , when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster , comes in handy , because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same . 
So it will always fit together , conceptually , of course . 
If Zappa 's music is performed , it gets its own logo . 
Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers , who all performed there , get their own Casa da Musica logo . 
It works the same internally with the president or the musical director , whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards . 
There is a full - blown orchestra living inside the building . 
It has a more transparent identity . 
The truck they go on tour with . 
Or there 's a smaller contemporary orchestra , 12 people that remixes its own title . 
And one of the handy things that came about was that you could take the logo type and create advertising out of it . 
Like this Donna Toney poster , or Chopin , or Mozart , or La Monte Young . 
You can take the shape and make typography out of it . 
You can grow it underneath the skin . 
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house , or a rave underneath the house or a weekly program , as well as educational services . 
Second insight . So far , until that point I had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes , which was fine with me . 
On one hand I have nothing against selling . 
My parents are both salespeople . 
But I did feel that I spent so much time learning this language , why do I only promote with it ? 
There must be something else . 
And the whole series of work came out of it . 
Some of you might have seen it . 
I showed some of it at earlier TEDs before , under the title " Things I 've Learned in My Life So Far . " 
I 'll just show two now . 
This is a whole wall of bananas at different ripenesses on the opening day in this gallery in New York . 
It says , " Self - confidence produces fine results . " 
This is after a week . 
After two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks . 
And you see the self confidence almost comes back , but not quite . 
These are some pictures visitors sent to me . 
And then the city of Amsterdam gave us a plaza and asked us to do something . 
We used the stone plates as a grid for our little piece . 
We got 250,000 coins from the central bank , at different darknesses . 
So we got brand new ones , shiny ones , medium ones , and very old , dark ones . 
And with the help of 100 volunteers , over a week , created this fairly floral typography that spelled , " Obsessions make my life worse and my work better . " 
And the idea of course was to make the type so precious that as an audience you would be in between , " Should I really take as much money as I can ? 
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now ? " 
While we built all this up during that week , with the 100 volunteers , a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it . 
So when it was finally done , and in the first night a guy came with big plastic bags and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry , one of the neighbors called the police . 
And the Amsterdam police in all their wisdom , came , saw , and they wanted to protect the artwork . 
And they swept it all up and put it into custody at police headquarters . 
I think you see , you see them sweeping . You see them sweeping right here . 
That 's the police , getting rid of it all . 
So after eight hours that 's pretty much all that was left of the whole thing . 
We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali . 
It 's a movie about happiness . 
And here we asked some nearby pigs to do the titles for us . 
They were n't quite slick enough . 
So we asked the goose to do it again , and hoped she would do somehow , a more elegant or pretty job . 
And I think she overdid it . 
Just a bit too ornamental . 
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest . 
And the monkeys in that monkey forest looked , actually , fairly happy . 
So we asked those guys to do it again . 
They did a fine job , but had a couple of readability problems . 
So of course whatever you do n't really do yourself does n't really get done properly . 
That film we 'll be working on for the next two years . 
So it 's going to be a while . 
And of course you might think that doing a film on happiness might not really be worthwhile . 
Then you can of course always go and see this guy . 
Video : And I 'm happy I 'm alive . 
I 'm happy I 'm alive . I 'm happy I 'm alive . 
Stefan Sagmeister : Thank you . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/lee_smolin_on_science_and_democracy.html 
Physicist Lee Smolin talks about how the scientific community works : as he puts it , " we fight and argue as hard as we can , " but everyone accepts that the next generation of scientists will decide who 's right . And , he says , that 's how democracy works , too .

Lee Smolin on science and democracy 
So , about three years ago I was in London , and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said , I represent a group of people , and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics . 
We have about 120 million dollars , and we want to do it well . 
We want to be in the forefront fields , and we want to do it differently . 
We want to get out of this thing where the young people have all the ideas , and the old people have all the power and decide what science gets done . 
It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea . 
Three years later , we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , Ontario . It ’s the most exciting job I ’ve ever had . 
And it ’s the first time I ’ve had a job where I ’m afraid to go away because of everything that ’s going to happen in this week when I ’m here . 
But in any case , what I ’m going to do in my little bit of time is take you on a quick tour of some of the things that we talk about and we think about . 
So , we think a lot about what really makes science work ? 
The first thing that anybody who knows science , and has been around science , is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method is wrong . There is no method . 
On the other hand , somehow we manage to reason together as a community , from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about . 
And this is , by the way , something that a democratic society also has to do . 
So how does it work ? 
Well , my belief is that it works because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics . 
And here are some of the ethical principles . 
I ’m not going to read them all to you because I ’m not in teacher mode . 
I ’m in entertain , amaze mode . 
But one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe . 
But we ’re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide , you know , whether I ’m right or somebody else is right , are the people in our community in the next generation , in 30 and 50 years . 
So it ’s this combination of respect for the tradition and community we ’re in , and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere , that makes science work . 
And being in this process of being in a community that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions , I believe , teaches us about democracy . 
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy , but there has been , historically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the cosmos is , and how people think about the society that they live in . 
And I want to talk about three stages in that evolution . 
The first science of cosmology that was anything like science was Aristotelian science , and that was hierarchical . 
The earth is in the center , then there are these crystal spheres , the sun , the moon , the planets and finally the celestial sphere , where the stars are . And everything in this universe has a place . 
And Aristotle ’s law of motion was that everything goes to its natural place , which was of course , the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in , and more importantly , the medieval society that , through Christianity , embraced Aristotle and blessed it . 
And the idea is that everything is defined . 
Where something is , is defined with respect to this last sphere , the celestial sphere , outside of which is this eternal , perfect realm , where lives God , who is the ultimate judge of everything . 
So that is both Aristotelian cosmology , and in a certain sense , medieval society . 
Now , in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about space and time and motion and so forth of Newton . 
And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought of John Locke and his collaborators . 
And they were very closely associated . 
In fact , Newton and Locke were friends . 
Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand , and a society on the other hand , were closely related . 
And let me show you . 
In a Newtonian universe , there ’s no center -- thank you . 
There are particles and they move around with respect to a fixed , absolute framework of space and time . 
It ’s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space , because that ’s defined , not with respect to say , where other things are , but with respect to this absolute notion of space , which for Newton was God . 
Now , similarly , in Locke ’s society there are individuals who have certain rights , properties in a formal sense , and those are defined with respect to some absolute , abstract notions of rights and justice , and so forth , which are independent of what else has happened in the society . 
Of who else there is , of the history and so forth . 
There is also an omniscient observer who knows everything , who is God , who is in a certain sense outside the universe , because he has no role in anything that happens , but is in a certain sense everywhere , because space is just the way that God knows where everything is , according to Newton , OK ? 
So this is the foundations of what ’s called , traditionally , liberal political theory and Newtonian physics . 
Now , in the 20th century we had a revolution that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century , and which is still going on . 
It was begun with the invention of relativity theory and quantum theory . 
And merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity , is the culmination of that , something that ’s going on right now . 
And in this universe there ’s nothing fixed and absolute . Zilch , OK . 
This universe is described by being a network of relationships . 
Space is just one aspect , so there ’s no meaning to say absolutely where something is . 
There ’s only where it is relative to everything else that is . 
And this network of relations is ever - evolving . 
So we call it a relational universe . 
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships . 
And also , if you ’re embedded in such a network of relationships , your view of the world has to do with what information comes to you through the network of relations . 
And there ’s no place for an omniscient observer or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything . 
So this is general relativity , this is quantum theory . 
This is also , if you talk to legal scholars , the foundations of new ideas in legal thought . 
They ’re thinking about the same things . 
And not only that , they make the analogy to relativity theory and cosmology often . 
So there ’s an interesting discussion going on there . 
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view . 
So the main slogan here is that there ’s nothing outside the universe , which means that there ’s no place to put an explanation for something outside . 
So in such a relational universe , if you come upon something that ’s ordered and structured , like this device here , or that device there , or something beautiful , like all the living things , all of you guys in the room -- " guys " in physics , by the way , is a generic term : men and women . 
Then you want to know , you ’re a person , you want to know how is it made . 
And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was , somehow it made itself . 
There must be mechanisms of self - organization inside the universe that make things . 
Because there ’s no place to put a maker outside , as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe . 
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self - organization . 
Now , Darwin taught us that there are processes of self - organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see . 
So it works . But not only that , if you think about how natural selection works , then it turns out that natural selection would only make sense in such a relational universe . 
That is , natural selection works on properties , like fitness , which are about relationships of some species to some other species . 
Darwin would n’t make sense in an Aristotelian universe , and would n’t really make sense in a Newtonian universe . 
So a theory of biology based on natural selection requires a relational notion of what are the properties of biological systems . 
And if you push that all the way down , really , it makes the best sense in a relational universe where all properties are relational . 
Now , not only that , but Einstein taught us that gravity is the result of the world being relational . 
If it was n’t for gravity , there would n’t be life , because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time , keeping pieces of the world , like the surface of the Earth , out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve . 
In the 20th century , we saw the independent development of two big themes in science . 
In the biological sciences , they explored the implications of the notion that order and complexity and structure arise in a self - organized way . 
That was the triumph of Neo - Darwinism and so forth . 
And slowly , that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences , the human sciences , economics , et cetera . 
At the same time , we physicists have been busy trying to make sense of and build on and integrate the discoveries of quantum theory and relativity . 
And what we ’ve been working out is the implications , really , of the idea that the universe is made up of relations . 
21st - century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas : the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world , on the one hand , and self - organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world , on the other hand . 
And also , is that in the 21st century our thinking about space and time and cosmology , and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve . 
And what they ’re evolving towards is the union of these two big ideas , Darwinism and relationalism . 
Now , if you think about democracy from this perspective , a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes that there are many different interests , many different agendas , many different individuals , many different points of view . 
Each one is incomplete , because you ’re embedded in a network of relationships . 
Any actor in a democracy is embedded in a network of relationships . 
And you understand some things better than other things , and because of that there ’s a continual jostling and give and take , which is politics . 
And politics is , in the ideal sense , the way in which we continually address our network of relations in order to achieve a better life and a better society . 
And I also think that science will never go away and -- I ’m finishing on this line . 
In fact , I ’m finished . Science will never go away .

Where are the baby dinosaurs ? In a spellbinding talk from TEDxVancouver paleontologist Jack Horner describes how slicing open fossil skulls revealed a shocking secret about some of our most beloved dinosaurs .

Jack Horner : Shape - shifting dinosaurs 
Shall I ask for a show of hands or a clapping of people in different generations ? 
I 'm interested in how many are three to 12 years old . 
None , huh ? 
All right . 
I 'm going to talk about dinosaurs . 
Do you remember dinosaurs when you were that age ? 
Dinosaurs are kind of funny , you know . 
We 're going to kind of go in a different direction right now . 
I hope you all realize that . 
So I 'll just give you my message up front : Try not to go extinct . 
That 's it . 
People ask me a lot -- in fact , one of the most asked questions I get is , why do children like dinosaurs so much ? 
What 's the fascination ? 
And I usually just say , " Well dinosaurs were big , different and gone . " 
They 're all gone . 
Well that 's not true , but we 'll get to the goose in a minute . 
So that 's sort of the theme : big , different and gone . 
The title of my talk : Shape - shifting Dinosaurs : The Cause of a Premature Extinction . 
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs . 
And there 's lots of different shapes . 
Lots of different kinds . 
A long time ago , back in the early 1900s , museums were out looking for dinosaurs . 
They went out and gathered them up . 
And this is an interesting story . 
Every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had . 
So if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur , a big one , then the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one and a better one . 
And that happened for all museums . 
So everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs . 
And this was in the early 1900s . 
By about 1970 , some scientists were sitting around and they thought , " What in the world ? 
Look at these dinosaurs . 
They 're all big . 
Where are all the little ones ? " 
And they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it : " Where are the little dinosaurs ? " 
Well , go to a museum , you 'll see , see how many baby dinosaurs there are . 
People assumed -- and this was actually a problem -- people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs , if they had juvenile dinosaurs , they 'd be easy to identify . 
You 'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur . 
But all they had were big dinosaurs . 
And it comes down to a couple of things . 
First off , scientists have egos , and scientists like to name dinosaurs . 
They like to name anything . 
Everybody likes to have their own animal that they named . 
And so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different . 
And what happened , of course , is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs . 
In 1975 , a light went on in somebody 's head . 
Dr. Peter Dodson at the University of Pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do , which is different than the way reptiles grow . 
And in fact , he used the cassowary as an example . 
And it 's kind of cool -- if you look at the cassowary , or any of the birds that have crests on their heads , they actually grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow . 
Now think about that . 
They 're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny . 
So allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth . 
So you can see that if you actually found one that was 80 percent grown and you did n't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary , you would think they were two different animals . 
So this was a problem , and Peter Dodson pointed this out using some duck - billed dinosaurs then called Hypacrosaurus . 
And he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult and make an average of what it should look like , if it grew in sort of a linear fashion , it would have a crest about half the size of the adult . 
But the actual sub - adult at 65 percent had no crest at all . 
So this was interesting . 
So this is where people went astray again . 
I mean , if they 'd have just taken that , taken Peter Dodson 's work , and gone on with that , then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have . 
But scientists have egos ; they like to name things . 
And so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different . 
Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur , or any animal , is a young one or an older one . 
And that 's by actually cutting into their bones . 
But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do , as you can imagine , because in museums bones are precious . 
You go into a museum and they take really good care of them . 
They put them in foam , little containers . 
They 're very well taken care of . 
They do n't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside . 
So they do n't normally let you do that . 
But I have a museum and I collect dinosaurs and I can saw mine open . 
So that 's what I do . 
So if you cut open a little dinosaur , it 's very spongy inside like A. 
And if you cut into an older dinosaur , it 's very massive . 
You can tell it 's mature bone . 
So it 's real easy to tell them apart . 
So what I want to do is show you these . 
In North America in the Northern Plains of the United States and the Southern Plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan , there 's this unit of rock called the Hell Creek Formation that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on Earth . 
And there are 12 of them that everyone recognizes -- I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs that went extinct . 
And so we will evaluate them . 
And that 's sort of what I 've been doing . 
So my students , my staff , we 've been cutting them open . 
Now as you can imagine , cutting open a leg bone is one thing , but when you go to a museum and say , " You do n't mind if I cut open your dinosaur 's skull do you ? " 
they say , " Go away . " 
So here are 12 dinosaurs . 
And we want to look at these three first . 
So these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurs . 
And everybody knows that these three animals are related . 
And the assumption is is that they 're related like cousins or whatever . 
But no one ever considered that they might be more closely related . 
In other words , people looked at them and they saw the differences . 
And you all know that if you are going to determine whether you 're related to your brother or your sister , you ca n't do it by looking at differences . 
You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities . 
So people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are . 
Pachycephalosaurus has a big , thick dome on its head , and it 's got some little bumps on the back of its head , and it 's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose . 
And then Stygimoloch , another dinosaur from the same age , lived at the same time , has spikes sticking out the back of its head . 
It 's got a little , tiny dome , and it 's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose . 
And then there 's this thing called Dracorex , Hogwart 's Eye . 
Guess where that came from ? Dragon . 
So here 's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head , no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose . 
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike . 
But they did look at these three and they said , " These are three different dinosaurs , and Dracorex is probably the most primitive of them . 
And the other one is more primitive than the other . 
It 's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out . 
But if you line them up , if you just take those three skulls and just line them up , they line up like this . 
Dracorex is the littlest one , Stygimoloch is the middle size one , Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one . 
And one would think , that should give me a clue . 
But it did n't give them a clue . 
Because , well we know why . 
Scientists like to name things . 
So if we cut open Dracorex -- I cut open our Dracorex -- and look , it was spongy inside , really spongy inside . 
I mean , it is a juvenile and it 's growing really fast . 
So it is going to get bigger . 
If you cut open Stygimoloch , it is doing the same thing . 
The dome , that little dome , is growing really fast . 
It 's inflating very fast . 
What 's interesting is the spike on the back of the Dracorex was growing very fast as well . 
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing , which means they 're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger . 
And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus , Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing . 
So just with these three dinosaurs , you can easily -- as a scientist -- we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series of the same animal . 
Which of course means that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct . 
Okay . 
Which of course means we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with . 
So a colleague of mine at Berkley , he and I were looking at Triceratops . 
And before the year 2000 -- now remember , Triceratops was first found in the 1800s -- before 2000 , no one had ever seen a juvenile Triceratops . 
There 's a Triceratops in every museum in the world , but no one had ever collected a juvenile . 
And we know why , right ? 
Because everybody wants to have a big one . 
So everyone had a big one . 
So we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones . 
They 're everywhere . They 're all over the place . 
So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum . 
And everybody says it 's because I have a little museum . 
When you have a little museum , you have little dinosaurs . 
If you look at the Triceratops , you can see it 's changing , it 's shape - shifting . 
As the juveniles are growing up , their horns actually curve backwards . 
And then as they grow older , the horns grow forward . 
And that 's pretty cool . 
If you look along the edge of the frill , they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do on the Pachycephalosaurs . 
And then , because the juveniles are in my collection , I cut them open and look inside . 
And the little one is really spongy . 
And the middle size one is really spongy . 
But what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy . 
And this is a skull that is two meters long . 
It 's a big skull . 
But there 's another dinosaur that is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops , except it 's bigger , and it 's called Torosaurus . 
And Torosaurus , when we cut into it , has mature bone . 
But it 's got these big holes in its shield . 
And everybody says , " A Triceratops and a Torosaurus ca n't possibly be the same animal because one of them 's bigger than the other one . " 
" And it has holes in its frill . " 
And I said , " Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses ? " 
And they said , " Well no , but it has holes in its frill . " 
So one of my graduate students , John Scannella , looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops and , of course it 's open , in Torosaurus -- so he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Torosaurus , which was pretty cool . 
So now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grownup Triceratops . 
Now when we name dinosaurs , when we name anything , the original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out . 
So Torosaurus is extinct . 
Triceratops , if you 've heard the news , a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong . 
They thought Torosaurus should be kept and Triceratops thrown out , but that 's not going to happen . 
All right , so we can do this with a bunch of dinosaurs . 
I mean , here 's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan . 
Anatotitan : giant duck . 
It 's a giant duck - bill dinosaur . 
Here 's another one . 
So we look at the bone histology . 
The bone histology tells us that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile , or at least a sub - adult , and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny . 
And we get rid of Anatotitan . 
So we can just keep doing this . 
And the last one is T. Rex . 
So there 's these two dinosaurs , T. Rex and Nanotyrannus . 
Again , makes you wonder . 
But they had a good question . 
They were looking at them and they said , " One 's got 17 teeth , and the biggest one 's got 12 teeth . 
And that does n't make any sense at all , because we do n't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older . 
So it must be true -- they must be different . " 
So we cut into them . 
And sure enough , Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone . 
It looks like it could still get bigger . 
And at the Museum of the Rockies where we work , I have four T. Rexes , so I can cut a whole bunch of them . 
But I did n't have to cut any of them really , because I just lined up their jaws and it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14 . 
And of course , Nano has 17 . 
And we just went out and looked at other people 's collections and we found one that has sort of 15 teeth . 
So again , real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus , and therefore we can take out another dinosaur . 
So when it comes down to our end cretaceous , we have seven left . 
And that 's a good number . 
That 's a good number to go extinct , I think . 
Now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with fourth - graders . 
Fourth - graders love their dinosaurs , they memorize them . 
And they 're not happy with this . 
Thank you very much .

Rory Bremner 's one - man world summit 
Chris has been so nice . 
I do n't know how you keep it up , Chris , I really do n't . 
So nice , all week . He 's the kind of man you could say to , " Chris , I 'm really sorry , I 've crashed your car . 
And it gets worse , I crashed it into your house . 
Your house has caught fire . 
And what 's more , your wife has just run off with your best friend . " 
And you know that Chris would say , " Thank you . " 
" Thank you for sharing , that 's really interesting . " 
" Thank you for taking me to a place that I did n't know existed . Thank you . " 
One of the -- Thank you for inviting us . 
One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that , gradually , as the days go by , all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say . 
Nuclear fusion , I had about 10 minutes on that . 
Spectroscopy , that was another one . 
Parallel universes . 
And so this morning I thought , " Oh well , I 'll just do a card trick . " 
That one 's gone as well . 
And today is Emmanuel 's day , I think we 've agreed that , already , have n't we ? 
Emmanuel ? Absolutely . 
I was planning on finishing on a dance ... 
So , that 's going to look pretty shabby now . 
So , what I thought I 'd do is -- in honor of Emmanuel -- is , what I can do is to launch today the first TED Global auction . 
If I could start , this is the Enigma decoding machine . 
Who will start me with $ 1,000 ? Anyone ? 
Thank you . Bruno 's face , just then , he said , " No , do n't go through this . Do n't , please do n't . 
Do n't go through this . Do n't do it . " 
I 'm worried . When I first got the invitation , they said somewhere in the thing , they said , " 15 minutes to change the world , your moment onstage . " 15 minutes to change the world . 
I do n't know about you , it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug . 
So , the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one . 
Well , of course now we know we do n't have to change a plug , now we 've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric -- fantastic . You know , it inspires us . 
300 years ago he 'd have been burnt at the stake for that . 
And now it 's an idea . 
It 's great . It 's fantastic . 
But you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way . 
Yesterday , David Deutsch , another one who covered most of what I was going to say . 
But when you think of the world in that way , it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience , do n't you think ? 
I mean , he must walk in and they will say , " Would you like a macchiato , or a latte , or an Americano , or a cappuccino ? " 
And he 'll say , " You 're offering me things that are infinitely variable . " 
" How can your coffee be true ? " 
And they will say , " Would you mind if I serve the next customer ? " 
And Elaine Morgan yesterday , was n't she wonderful ? 
Fantastic . Really good . 
Her talk about the aquatic ape , and the link , of course , the link between Darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this -- we 're not hirsute and we can swim rather well . 
And she said , you know , she 's 90 . She 's running out of time , she said . 
And she 's desperate to find more evidence for the link . 
And I think , " I 'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh . " 
This man has swum around the North Pole , what more evidence do you want ? 
And there he is . 
That 's how TED brings these connections together . 
I was n't here on Tuesday . I did n't actually see Gordon Brown 's job application -- um , sorry . 
I 'm so sorry . 
I 'm so sorry . No , no . 
No , no , ahh ... 
: " Global problems require Scottish solutions . " 
The problem I have is because Gordon Brown , he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who 's just taken the head off a bear suit . 
: " Hello , can I tell you what happened in the woods back there ? 
Uh , no . " 
" I 'm sorry . I 've only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions . 
Our work on climate change , I 've only got 18 minutes , unfortunately I 'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we 're doing to promote the climate change agenda in Great Britain , like the third runway we 're planning at Heathrow Airport ... " 
" The large coal - fired power station we 're building at King 's North , and of course the exciting news that only today , only this week , Britain 's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close . 
No time , unfortunately , to mention those . " 
" British jobs for Scottish people ... 
No . " 
" Christian principles , Christian values . 
Thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not steal , thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife . " 
" Although to be honest , when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem . " 
: " Yeah , alright , come on , eh . 
Alright Gordon , come on , eh . 
I just , can I just say a few things about , first about Cherie , because she 's a wonderful lady , my wife , with a wonderful smile . 
That reminds me , I must post that letter . " 
" I just think , you know , what people forget , Gordon and I , we always got on perfectly well . 
Alright , it was never exactly ' Brokeback Mountain . ' " " You know , I wrote to him , just before I left office . I said , ' Can I rely on your support for the next month ? ' And he wrote back . He said , ' No , you ca n't . ' Which kind of surprised me , because I 'd never seen ' ca n't ' spelled that way before . " 
Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the Mansion House in 2002 -- that was to the building ; the people were n't listening . 
But the people , when talking about the finance industry , he said , " What you as the city of London have done for financial services , we , as a government , hope to do for the economy as a whole . " 
When you think what 's happened to financial services , and you see what 's happened to the economy , you think , " Well , there is a man who delivers on his promises . " 
But we 're in a new world now . We 're in a completely new world . 
This is the first time that I can remember , where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan , you do n't know if you 're borrowing money from him , or if he 's borrowing money from you . 
Am I right ? 
These extraordinary things , Icelandic Internet accounts . 
Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account ? 
Why would you do that ? Why would -- It 's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria , is n't it ? 
Asking for your bank details . 
And , you know , Iceland , it was never going to cut it . 
It did n't have that kind of collateral . 
What does it have ? It has fish , that 's all . 
That 's why the Prime Minister went on television . He said , " This has left us all with a very big haddock . " 
A lot of what I do -- I have to try and make sense of things before I can make nonsense of them . 
And making sense of the financial crisis is very , very difficult . 
Luckily , somebody like George Bush was really helpful . 
He summed it up , really , at a dinner . 
He was speaking at a dinner , he said , " Wall Street got drunk . " 
" And now it 's got a hangover . " 
And that 's , you know , that 's something -- And that 's something we can relate to . 
It 's certainly something he can relate to . 
And the other one , of course , is Donald Rumsfeld , who said , " There are the known knowns , the things we know we know . 
And then you got the known unknowns , the things we know we do n't know . 
And then you got the unknown unknowns , those are the things we do n't know we do n't know . " 
And being English , when I first heard that I thought , " What a load of cock . " 
And then , you 're now , well , actually , that 's what this is about . 
This whole , what Ben Bernanke has said , the chaotic unwinding of the world 's financial system , it 's about -- they do n't know , they did n't know what they were doing . 
In 2006 , the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said , quote , " As we can clearly see , no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy . " 
Now , there is a man on top of his job . 
And when the crisis was happening , the head of quantitative equities at Lehman Brothers said , " Events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days . " 
So , it 's extraordinary . It 's a new world that 's very , very difficult to make sense of . 
But we have a new hope . We have a new man . 
America has now elected its first openly black President . 
Wonderful news . 
Not only that , he 's left - handed . Have you noticed this ? 
How many people here are left - handed ? 
You see , a lot of the people that I most admire , they 're great artists , great designers , great thinkers , they 're left - handed . 
And somebody said to me last night , you know , being left - handed , you have to learn to write without smudging the ink . 
And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday . 
And I thought , what a wonderful metaphor , is n't it ? An American President who has to write without smudging the ink . 
You like that one ? As opposed to you could see George Bush , well , what 's the metaphor there ? 
I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing , would n't it ? 
" Well , you know I 'm sorry about that . 
I 'm right - handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well . " 
But , you know , he 's gone . Now he 's gone . 
That 's eight years of American History , eight minutes of my act , just gone like that . 
" You know , it 's the end of an error [ sic ] . 
I happen to believe it was a great error . 
I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the United States . 
But we proved them wrong in Iraq . 
They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda . 
There is now . " 
" But I have a message for the suicide bombers , for those people who 've blown themselves up . " 
" We 're going to find you . " 
" We 're going to make sure you do n't do it again . " 
But now he 's gone , and it 's great to see one of the -- arguably one of the worst speech makers in American history , now given way to one of the greatest , in Obama . 
You were there , maybe , on the night of his victory . 
And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago , he said , " If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible ... " 
I ca n't do the whole thing because it would take too long , it really would . 
But you get the picture . And then it goes to the inauguration . 
And he and the Chief Justice , they trip over each other , they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up . 
And there is George Bush sitting there going , " Heh heh heh heh ... " 
" Not so easy is it ? Heh heh heh . " 
But the interesting thing is , Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero , who said , people would listen to a speech , they said , " Great speech . " 
And then they 'd listen to Demosthenes , and they 'd say , " Let 's march . " 
And we all want to believe in President Obama . 
It 's rather like that line in the film " As Good As it Gets . " 
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson , and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson , " What do you see in me ? " 
And Jack Nicholson just says , " You make me want to be a better man . " 
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen . Right ? 
But at the moment , it 's a Cicero thing . 
We like what Barack Obama says , but we do n't do anything about it . 
So he comes over to this country , and he says , " We need a big fiscal stimulus . " 
And everyone goes , " Great ! " He leaves the country and the French and the Germans go , " No , no , forget about that , absolutely not . " Nothing happens . He goes to Strasburg . 
He says , " We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan . " 
And everyone goes , " Great idea . " 
He leaves , people go , " No no no , we 're not going to do that . 
5,000 maximum , and no rockets . No , no , not going to do it . " 
He goes to Prague , he says , " We believe in a nuclear - free world . " 
And it 's great to have an American president who can say the word " nuclear , " let 's just point that out first . 
Do you remember that ? George Bush , " A nu - ca - ler . " 
Sorry , what ? " A nu - ca - ler . " 
Could you say " avuncular " ? " Avunclear . " 
Thank you very much . 
But he says , " We want a nuclear - free world . " 
And that day , North Korea , that very day , North Korea is just seeing if it can just get one over Japan -- -- and land it before ... 
So , where do we look for inspiration ? We 've still got Bill Clinton . 
" Travels the world . " 
" I believe , I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ... " 
" Tell a lie ; it was Diana Ross ... " 
" ... who said , reach out and touch ... " 
" ... somebody 's gla -- hand . " 
" Make this world a better place , if you can . 
I just think that 's important . I really do . 
And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House , because she 'd have been out of our home for four years . 
And I , you know . " 
" So , when that did n't work out I had to make a few arrangements , let me tell you . " 
So , there 's him . In Britain we have Prince Charles : " And the environment is so important , all we can do . 
My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda . " 
Or , any South Africans , we have Mandela to inspire . 
Mandela , the great man Mandela . 
He 's been honored with a statue now . 
The previous highest honor he had in Britain was a visit from the team from Ground Force , a gardening program . 
" So , Nelson , how would you like a nice water feature ? " 
" Ahh , listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh . " 
" I was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean . 
Why would I need a bloody water feature ? " 
Very quickly : I was n't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the " Japanese Essays on Idleness " which said it 's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth . 
Thank you very much indeed .

In this engrossing EG talk , architect Liz Diller shares her firm DS+R 's more unusual work , including the Blur Building , whose walls are made of fog , and the revamped Alice Tully Hall , which is wrapped in glowing wooden skin .

Liz Diller plays with architecture 
Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space , architecture is nothing but a special - effects machine that delights and disturbs the senses . 
Our work is across media . The work comes in all shapes and sizes . 
It 's small and large . This is an ashtray , a water glass . 
From urban planning and master planning to theater and all sorts of stuff . 
The thing that all the work has in common is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space . 
And these are everyday conventions , conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity . 
And I 've assembled a sampling of work that all share a kind of productive nihilism that 's used in the service of creating a particular special effect . 
And that is something like nothing , or something next to nothing . 
It 's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through . 
This is an image that won us a competition for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002 on Lake Neuchatel , near Geneva . 
And we wanted to use the water not only as a context , but as a primary building material . 
We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere . 
So , no walls , no roof , no purpose -- just a mass of atomized water , a big cloud . 
And this proposal was a reaction to the over - saturation of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions , which feeds , or has been feeding , our insatiable appetite for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity . 
High definition , in our opinion , has become the new orthodoxy . 
And we ask the question , can we use technology , high technology , to make an expo pavilion that 's decidedly low definition , that also challenges the conventions of space and skin , and rethinks our dependence on vision ? 
So this is how we sought to do it . 
Water 's pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high - pressure fog nozzles , 35,000 of them . And a weather station is on the structure . 
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature , humidity , wind direction , wind speed , dew point , and it processes this data in a central computer that calibrates the degree of water pressure and distribution of water throughout . 
And it 's a responsive system that 's trained on actual weather . 
So , this is just in construction , and there 's a tensegrity structure . 
It 's about 300 feet wide , the size of a football field , and it sits on just four very delicate columns . 
These are the fog nozzles , the interface , and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather , and producing kind of semi - artificial and real weather . 
So , we 're very interested in creating weather . I do n't know why . 
Now , here we go , one side , the outside and then from the inside of the space you can see what the quality of the space was . 
Unlike entering any normal space , entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium . 
It 's formless , featureless , depthless , scaleless , massless , purposeless and dimensionless . 
All references are erased , leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles . 
So , this is an exhibition pavilion where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do . 
And we pride ourselves -- it 's a spectacular anti - spectacle in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head . 
So , the audience is dispersed , focused attention and dramatic build - up and climax are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention that 's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog . 
And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way . 
So here the world is put out of focus , while our visual dependence is put into focus . 
The public , you know , once disoriented can actually ascend to the angel deck above and then just come down under those lips into the water bar . 
So , all the waters of the world are served there , so we thought that , you know , after being at the water and moving through the water and breathing the water , you could also drink this building . 
And so it is sort of a theme , but it goes a little bit , you know , deeper than that . 
We really wanted to bring out our absolute dependence on this master sense , and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses . 
You know , when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell , because the Swiss said , " Well , why are we going to spend , you know , 10 million dollars producing an effect that we already have in natural abundance that we hate ? " 
And , you know , we thought -- well , we tried to convince them . 
And in the end , you know , they adapted this as a national icon that came to represent Swiss doubt , which we -- you know , it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of . 
Anyway , it 's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed , and so it 's now a memory of an apparition , actually , but it continues to live in edible form . 
And this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar . 
Anyway , moving along . 
So in the ' 80s and ' 90s , we were mostly known for independent work , such as installation artist , architect , commissioned projects by museums and non - for - profit organizations . 
And we did a lot of media work , also a lot of experimental theater projects . 
In 2003 , the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work that featured a lot of this work from the ' 80s and ' 90s . 
However , the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective , and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show . 
This was a piece on tourism in the United States . 
This is " Soft Sell " for 42nd Street . 
This was something done at the Cartier Foundation . 
" Master / Slave " at the MOMA , the project series , a piece called " Parasite . " 
And so there were many , many of these kinds of projects . 
Anyway , they gave us the whole fourth floor , and , you know , the problem of the retrospective was something we were very uncomfortable with . 
It 's a kind of invention of the museum that 's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding to the public of a body of work . 
And our work does n't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all . 
And one of the recurring themes , by the way , that in the work was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself , and asking about the conventions of the museum , like the wall , the white wall . 
So , what you see here is basically a plan of many installations that were put there . 
And we actually had to install white walls to separate these pieces , which did n't belong together . 
But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time . 
We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation . 
And what you see is -- actually , the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element , which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the -- which was a robotic drill , basically , that went all the way around , cruised the museum , went all around the walls and did a lot of damage . 
So , the drill was mounted on this robotic arm . 
We worked with , by the way , Honeybee Robotics . This is the brain . 
Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller , and it was really very much fun to work with them . 
They were n't doing their primary work , which was for the government , while they were helping us with this . 
In any case , the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls . 
So , unfolded it 's about 300 linear feet . 
And it randomly generates points within a three - dimensional matrix . 
It selects a point , it guides the drill to that point , it pierces the dry wall , leaving a half - inch hole before traveling to the next location . 
Initially these holes were lone blemishes , and as the exhibition continued the walls became increasingly perforated . 
So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned , opening views from gallery to gallery . 
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall . 
And so this was a three - month performance piece in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element . 
And also the acoustic separation was destroyed . 
Also the visual separation . 
And there was also this constant background groan , which was very annoying . 
And this is one of the blackout spaces where there 's a video piece that became totally not useful . 
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display , the wall now actively competed for attention . 
And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance basically exposed the discomfort of the work to this encompassing nature of the retrospective . 
It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text . 
Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago . 
It 's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston , which is on the waterfront . 
And there 's not enough time to really introduce the building , but I 'll simply say that the building negotiates between this outwardly focused nature of the site -- you know , it 's a really great waterfront site in Boston -- and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum . 
So , the nature of the building is that it looks at looking -- I mean that 's its primary objective , both its program and its architectural conceit . 
The building incorporates the site , but it dispenses it in very small doses in the way that the museum is choreographed . 
So , you come in and you 're basically squeezed by the theater , by the belly of the theater , into this very compressed space where the view is turned off . 
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall . 
This elevator 's about the size of a New York City studio apartment . 
And then , this is a view going up , and then you could come into the theater , which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop . 
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open . 
The view is denied in the galleries where we receive just natural light , and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view . 
The original intention of this space , which was unfortunately never realized , was to use lenticular glass which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out . 
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax , but to have the view stalk you , so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other . 
This was eliminated because the view was too good , and the mayor said , " No , we just want this open . " 
The architect lost here . 
But culminating -- and that 's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk -- is this Mediatheque , which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building . 
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it 's quite substantial . 
So , it 's already sticking out into space enough , and then from that is this , is this small area called the Mediatheque . 
The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations where the public can get onto the server and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web . 
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building , and here is a point where architecture -- this is like technology - free -- architecture is only a framing device , it only edits the harbor view , the industrial harbor just through its walls , its floors and its ceiling , to only expose the water itself , the texture of water , much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow or a lava lamp or something like that . 
And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence of the technological and the natural in the project . 
But there is just no information , it 's just -- it 's just hypnosis . 
Moving along to Lincoln Center . 
These are the guys that did the project in the first place , 50 years ago . 
We 're taking over now , doing work that ranges in scale from small - scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions . 
But we 're doing it with a lot less testosterone . 
This is the extent of the work that 's to be completed by 2010 . 
And for the purposes of this talk , I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that 's even a part of a project that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects , and it happens to be our current obsession , and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction . 
It 's Alice Tully Hall , and it 's tucked under the Juilliard Building and descends several levels under the street . 
So , this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be , before the renovation , which we just started . 
And we asked ourselves , why could n't it be exhibitionistic , like the Met , or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center ? 
And one of the things that we were asked to do was give it a street identity , expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible . 
And this building , which is just naturally hermetic , we stripped . 
We basically did a striptease , architectural striptease , where we 're framing with this kind of canopy -- the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard , about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway , and then exposing , using that canopy to frame Tully Hall . 
Before and after shot . 
Wait a minute , it 's just in that state , we have a long way to go . 
But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left to just talk about the hall itself , which is kind of where we 're really doing a massive amount of work . 
So , the hall is a multi - purpose hall . 
The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall . 
Now , that 's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats . 
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons and small - scale performances . They asked us to bring an intimacy . 
How do you bring an intimacy into a hall ? 
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things . 
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy . 
One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall . 
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall . 
It 's like a coffin , it basically sends all the sound , like a gutter - ball effect , down the aisles . 
The walls are made of absorptive surface , half absorptive , half reflective , which is not very good for concert sound . 
This is Avery Fisher Hall , but the notion of junk -- visual junk -- was very , very important to us , to get rid of visual noise . 
Because we ca n't eliminate a single seat , the architecture is restricted to 18 inches . 
So it 's a very , very thin architecture . 
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation , to take away the distraction of the subway noise . 
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard -- with a material , with a wood material that basically covers all the surfaces : wall , ceiling , floor , stage , steps , everything , boxes . 
But it 's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage . And here 's an acoustic shelf . 
Looking up the hall . Just a section of the stage . 
Just everything is lined , it incorporates -- every single thing that you could possibly imagine is tucked into this high - performance skin . 
But one more added feature . 
So now that we 've stripped the hall of all visual distraction , everything that prevents this intimacy which is supposed to connect the house , the audience , with the performers , we add one little detail , one piece of architectural excess , a special effect : lighting . 
We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival as it is when the concert starts . 
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect , this lighting effect , which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls . 
And what it entails is the use of resin , of this very thick resin with a veneer of the same kind of wood that 's used throughout the hall , in a kind of seamless continuity that wraps the hall in light , like a belt of light : rather than separating , like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers , it connects audience with players . 
And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full - scale . 
And this is a guy from Salt Lake City , this is what they look like out there . 
And for us , I mean it 's really kind of a very strange thing , but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin , very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier , the walls will just exude this glow , temporarily stealing attention from the stage . 
And this is Tully in construction now . 
I have no ending to say , except that I 'm a couple of minutes over . 
Thank you very much .

Kamal Meattle on how to grow fresh air 
Some 17 years ago , I became allergic to Delhi 's air . 
My doctors told me that my lung capacity had gone down to 70 percent , and it was killing me . 
With the help of IIT , TERI , and learnings from NASA , we discovered that there are three basic green plants , common green plants , with which we can grow all the fresh air we need indoors to keep us healthy . 
We 've also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building , while maintaining industry indoor air - quality standards . 
The three plants are Areca palm , Mother - in - Law 's Tongue and money plant . 
The botanical names are in front of you . 
Areca palm is a plant which removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen . 
We need four shoulder - high plants per person , and in terms of plant care , we need to wipe the leaves every day in Delhi , and perhaps once a week in cleaner - air cities . 
We had to grow them in vermi manure , which is sterile , or hydroponics , and take them outdoors every three to four months . 
The second plant is Mother - in - law 's Tongue , which is again a very common plant , and we call it a bedroom plant , because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night . 
And we need six to eight waist - high plants per person . 
The third plant is money plant , and this is again a very common plant ; preferably grows in hydroponics . 
And this particular plant removes formaldehydes and other volatile chemicals . 
With these three plants , you can grow all the fresh air you need . 
In fact , you could be in a bottle with a cap on top , and you would not die at all , and you would not need any fresh air . 
We have tried these plants at our own building in Delhi , which is a 50,000-square - feet , 20-year - old building . 
And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants . 
Our studies have found that there is a 42 percent probability of one 's blood oxygen going up by one percent if one stays indoors in this building for 10 hours . 
The government of India has discovered or published a study to show that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi . 
And the study showed that , compared to other buildings , there is a reduced incidence of eye irritation by 52 percent , respiratory systems by 34 percent , headaches by 24 percent , lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent . 
And this study has been published on September 8 , 2008 , and it 's available on the government of India website . 
Our experience points to an amazing increase in human productivity by over 20 percent by using these plants . 
And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings by an outstanding 15 percent , because you need less fresh air . 
We are now replicating this in a 1.75-million - square - feet building , which will have 60,000 indoor plants . 
Why is this important ? 
It is also important for the environment , because the world 's energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade . 
40 percent of the world 's energy is taken up by buildings currently , and 60 percent of the world 's population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years . 
And there is a growing preference for living and working in air - conditioned places .

Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talks bluntly about politics and diplomacy , making the case that women 's issues deserve a place at the center of foreign policy . Far from being a " soft " issue , she says , women 's issues are often the very hardest ones , dealing directly with life and death . A frank and funny Q&A with Pat Mitchell from the Paley Center .

Madeleine Albright : On being a woman and a diplomat 
Pat Mitchell : What is the story of this pin ? 
Madeleine Albright : This is " Breaking the Glass Ceiling . " 
PM : Oh . 
That was well chosen , I would say , for TEDWomen . 
MA : Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen . 
And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it had n't been for Saddam Hussein . 
I 'll tell you what happened . 
I went to the United Nations as an ambassador , and it was after the Gulf War , and I was an instructed ambassador . 
And the cease - fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions , and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly , which he deserved -- he had invaded another country . 
And so all of a sudden , a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things , but among them an " unparalleled serpent . " 
And so I happened to have a snake pin . 
So I wore it when we talked about Iraq . 
And when I went out to meet the press , they zeroed in , said , " Why are you wearing that snake pin ? " 
I said , " Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent . " 
And then I thought , well this is fun . 
So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would , in fact , reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day . 
So that 's how it all started . 
PM : So how large is the collection ? 
MA : Pretty big . 
It 's now traveling . 
At the moment it 's in Indianapolis , but it was at the Smithsonian . 
And it goes with a book that says , " Read My Pins . " 
PM : So is this a good idea . 
I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State , and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing , how you looked -- the thing that happens to a lot of women , especially if they 're the first in a position . 
So how do you feel about that -- the whole -- MA : Well , it 's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing . 
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had . 
What was interesting was that , before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador , I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick , who 'd been ambassador before me , and she said , " You 've got to get rid of your professor clothes . 
Go out and look like a diplomat . " 
So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping . 
But still , there were all kinds of questions about -- " did you wear a hat ? " " How short was your skirt ? " 
And one of the things -- if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots , and she got criticized over that . 
And no guy ever gets criticized . But that 's the least of it . 
PM : It is , for all of us , men and women , finding our ways of defining our roles , and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future . 
How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother , a grandmother , nurturing ... 
and so how did you handle that ? 
MA : Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I 'd been named . 
And I said , " Well I 've been a woman for 60 years , but I 've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes . " 
So it evolved . 
But basically I love being a woman . 
And so what happened -- and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this -- I went to my first meeting , first at the U.N. , and that 's when this all started , because that is a very male organization . 
And I 'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council -- so 14 men sat there staring at me , and I thought -- well you know how we all are . 
You want to get the feeling of the room , and " do people like me ? " 
and " will I really say something intelligent ? " 
And all of a sudden I thought , " Well , wait a minute . 
I am sitting behind a sign that says ' The United States , ' and if I do n't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard , " and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal , reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country . 
And so that happened more at various times , but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman . 
I think we are a lot better at personal relationships , and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it 's necessary . 
But I have to tell you , I have my youngest granddaughter , when she turned seven last year , said to her mother , my daughter , " So what 's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State ? 
Only girls are Secretary of State . " 
PM : Because in her lifetime -- MA : That would be so . 
PM : What a change that is . 
As you travel now all over the world , which you do frequently , how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls ? 
Where are we ? 
MA : I think we 're slowly changing , but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different . 
And therefore it means that we have to remember that , while many of us have had huge opportunities -- and Pat , you have been a real leader in your field -- is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women . 
And so what I have felt -- and I have looked at this from a national security issue -- when I was Secretary of State , I decided that women 's issues had to be central to American foreign policy , not just because I 'm a feminist , but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered , that values are passed down , the health situation is better , education is better , there is greater economic prosperity . 
So I think that it behooves us -- those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice -- that we need to help other women . 
And I really dedicated myself to that , both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State . 
PM : And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy ? 
MA : From some people . 
I think that they thought that it was a soft issue . 
The bottom line that I decided was actually women 's issues are the hardest issues , because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects , and because , as I said , it is really central to the way that we think about things . 
Now for instance , some of the wars that took place when I was in office , a lot of them , the women were the main victims of it . 
For instance , when I started , there were wars in the Balkans . 
The women in Bosnia were being raped . 
We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues . 
And by the way , one of the things that I did at that stage was , I had just arrived at the U.N. , and when I was there , there were 183 countries in the U.N. 
Now there are 192 . 
But it was one of the first times that I did n't have to cook lunch myself . 
So I said to my assistant , " Invite the other women permanent representatives . " 
And I thought when I 'd get to my apartment that there 'd be a lot of women there . 
I get there , and there are six other women , out of 183 . 
So the countries that had women representatives were Canada , Kazakhstan , Philippines , Trinidad Tobago , Jamaica , Lichtenstein and me . 
So being an American , I decided to set up a caucus . 
And so we set it up , and we called ourselves the G7 . 
PM : Is that " Girl 7 ? " MA : Girl 7 . 
And we lobbied on behalf of women 's issues . 
So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal . 
And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war , that it was against humanity . 
PM : So when you look around the world and you see that , in many cases -- certainly in the Western world -- women are evolving into more leadership positions , and even other places some barriers are being brought down , but there 's still so much violence , still so many problems , and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables . 
Now you were at those negotiating tables when they were n't , when there was maybe you -- one voice , maybe one or two others . 
Do you believe , and can you tell us why , there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis ? 
MA : Well I do think , when there are more women , that the tone of the conversation changes , and also the goals of the conversation change . 
But it does n't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women . 
If you think that , you 've forgotten high school . 
But the bottom line is that there is a way , when there are more women at the table , that there 's an attempt to develop some understanding . 
So for instance , what I did when I went to Burundi , we 'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda . 
And so I think the capability of women to put themselves -- I think we 're better about putting ourselves into the other guy 's shoes and having more empathy . 
I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room . 
When I was Secretary of State , there were only 13 other women foreign ministers . 
And so it was nice when one of them would show up . 
For instance , she is now the president of Finland , but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and , at a certain stage , head of the European Union . 
And it was really terrific . 
Because one of the things I think you 'll understand . 
We went to a meeting , and the men in my delegation , when I would say , " Well I feel we should do something about this , " and they 'd say , " What do you mean , you feel ? " 
And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me . 
And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control , and she said , " Well I feel we should do this . " 
And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden . 
But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions . 
The other thing that I think is really important : A lot of national security policy is n't just about foreign policy , but it 's about budgets , military budgets , and how the debts of countries work out . 
So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts , they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries . 
PM : So how do we get this balance we 're looking for , then , in the world ? 
More women 's voices at the table ? 
More men who believe that the balance is best ? 
MA : Well I think one of the things -- I 'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates . 
I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office , to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices . 
I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other . 
Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about , because I am of a certain age where , when I started in my career , believe it or not , there were other women who criticized me : " Why are n't you in the carpool line ? " 
or " Are n't your children suffering because you 're not there all the time ? " 
And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty . 
In fact , I think " guilt " is every woman 's middle name . 
And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other . 
And my motto is that there 's a special place in hell for women who do n't help each other . 
PM : Well Secretary Albright , I guess you 'll be going to heaven . 
Thank you for joining us today . 
MA : Thank you all . Thanks Pat .

Human beings have been campaigning against inequality and poverty for 3,000 years . But this journey is accelerating . Bono " embraces his inner nerd " and shares inspiring data that shows the end of poverty is in sight … if we can harness the momentum .

Bono : The good news on poverty 
Chris Anderson asked me if I could put the last 25 years of anti - poverty campaigning into 10 minutes for TED . 
That 's an Englishman asking an Irishman to be succinct . 
I said , " Chris , that would take a miracle . " 
He said , " Bono , would n't that be a good use of your messianic complex ? " 
So , yeah . 
Then I thought , let 's go even further than 25 years . 
Let 's go back before Christ , three millennia , to a time when , at least in my head , the journey for justice , the march against inequality and poverty really began . 
Three thousand years ago , civilization just getting started on the banks of the Nile , some slaves , Jewish shepherds in this instance , smelling of sheep shit , I guess , proclaimed to the Pharaoh , sitting high on his throne , " We , your majesty - ness , are equal to you . " 
And the Pharaoh replies , " Oh , no . 
You , your miserableness , have got to be kidding . " 
And they say , " No , no , that 's what it says here in our holy book . " 
Cut to our century , same country , same pyramids , another people spreading the same idea of equality with a different book . 
This time it 's called the Facebook . 
Crowds are gathered in Tahrir Square . 
They turn a social network from virtual to actual , and kind of rebooted the 21st century . 
Not to undersell how messy and ugly the aftermath of the Arab Spring has been , neither to oversell the role of technology , but these things have given a sense of what 's possible when the age - old model of power , the pyramid , gets turned upside down , putting the people on top and the pharaohs of today on the bottom , as it were . 
It 's also shown us that something as powerful as information and the sharing of it can challenge inequality , because facts , like people , want to be free , and when they 're free , liberty is usually around the corner , even for the poorest of the poor -- facts that can challenge cynicism and the apathy that leads to inertia , facts that tell us what 's working and , more importantly , what 's not , so we can fix it , facts that if we hear them and heed them could help us meet the challenge that Nelson Mandela made back in 2005 , when he asked us to be that great generation that overcomes that most awful offense to humanity , extreme poverty , facts that build a powerful momentum . 
So I thought , forget the rock opera , forget the bombast , my usual tricks . 
The only thing singing today would be the facts , for I have truly embraced by inner nerd . 
So exit the rock star . 
Enter the evidence - based activist , the factivist . 
Because what the facts are telling us is that the long , slow journey , humanity 's long , slow journey of equality , is actually speeding up . 
Look at what 's been achieved . 
Look at the pictures these data sets print . 
Since the year 2000 , since the turn of the millennium , there are eight million more AIDS patients getting life - saving antiretroviral drugs . 
Malaria : There are eight countries in sub - Saharan Africa that have their death rates cut by 75 percent . 
For kids under five , child mortality , kids under five , it 's down by 2.65 million a year . 
That 's a rate of 7,256 children 's lives saved each day . 
Wow . Wow . 
Let 's just stop for a second , actually , and think about that . 
Have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number ? Wow . 
Great news . It drives me nuts that most people do n't seem to know this news . 
Seven thousand kids a day . Here 's two of them . 
This is Michael and Benedicta , and they 're alive thanks in large part to Dr. Patricia Asamoah -- she 's amazing -- and the Global Fund , which all of you financially support , whether you know it or not . 
And the Global Fund provides antiretroviral drugs that stop mothers from passing HIV to their kids . 
This fantastic news did n't happen by itself . 
It was fought for , it was campaigned for , it was innovated for . 
And this great news gives birth to even more great news , because the historic trend is this . 
The number of people living in back - breaking , soul - crushing extreme poverty has declined from 43 percent of the world 's population in 1990 to 33 percent by 2000 and then to 21 percent by 2010 . 
Give it up for that . 
Halved . Halved . 
Now , the rate is still too high -- still too many people unnecessarily losing their lives . 
There 's still work to do . 
But it 's heart - stopping . It 's mind - blowing stuff . 
And if you live on less than $ 1.25 a day , if you live in that kind of poverty , this is not just data . 
This is everything . 
If you 're a parent who wants the best for your kids -- and I am -- this rapid transition is a route out of despair and into hope . 
And guess what ? If the trajectory continues , look where the amount of people living on $ 1.25 a day gets to by 2030 . 
Ca n't be true , can it ? 
That 's what the data is telling us . If the trajectory continues , we get to , wow , the zero zone . 
For number - crunchers like us , that is the erogenous zone , and it 's fair to say that I am , by now , sexually aroused by the collating of data . 
So virtual elimination of extreme poverty , as defined by people living on less than $ 1.25 a day , adjusted , of course , for inflation from a 1990 baseline . 
We do love a good baseline . 
That 's amazing . 
Now I know that some of you think this progress is all in Asia or Latin America or model countries like Brazil -- and who does n't love a Brazilian model ? -- but look at sub - Saharan Africa . 
There 's a collection of 10 countries , some call them the lions , who in the last decade have had a combination of 100 percent debt cancellation , a tripling of aid , a tenfold increase in FDI -- that 's foreign direct investment -- which has unlocked a quadrupling of domestic resources -- that 's local money -- which , when spent wisely -- that 's good governance -- cut childhood mortality by a third , doubled education completion rates , and they , too , halved extreme poverty , and at this rate , these 10 get to zero too . 
So the pride of lions is the proof of concept . 
There are all kinds of benefits to this . 
For a start , you wo n't have to listen to an insufferable little jumped - up Jesus like myself . 
How about that ? 
And 2028 , 2030 ? It 's just around the corner . 
I mean , it 's about three Rolling Stones farewell concerts away . 
I hope . I 'm hoping . 
Makes us look really young . 
So why are n't we jumping up and down about this ? 
Well , the opportunity is real , but so is the jeopardy . 
We ca n't get this done until we really accept that we can get this done . 
Look at this graph . 
It 's called inertia . It 's how we screw it up . 
And the next one is really beautiful . 
It 's called momentum . 
And it 's how we can bend the arc of history down towards zero , just doing the things that we know work . 
So inertia versus momentum . 
There is jeopardy , and of course , the closer you get , it gets harder . 
We know the obstacles that are in our way right now , in difficult times . 
In fact , today in your capital , in difficult times , some who mind the nation 's purse want to cut life - saving programs like the Global Fund . 
But you can do something about that . 
You can tell politicians that these cuts [ can cost ] lives . 
Right now today , in Oslo as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their payments to governments for extracting oil in developing countries . 
You can do something about that too . 
You can join the One Campaign , and leaders like Mo Ibrahim , the telecom entrepreneur . 
We 're pushing for laws that make sure that at least some of the wealth under the ground ends up in the hands of the people living above it . 
And right now , we know that the biggest disease of all is not a disease . It 's corruption . 
But there 's a vaccine for that too . 
It 's called transparency , open data sets , something the TED community is really on it . 
Daylight , you could call it , transparency . 
And technology is really turbocharging this . 
It 's getting harder to hide if you 're doing bad stuff . 
So let me tell you about the U - report , which I 'm really excited about . It 's 150,000 millennials all across Uganda , young people armed with 2 G phones , an SMS social network exposing government corruption and demanding to know what 's in the budget and how their money is being spent . 
This is exciting stuff . 
Look , once you have these tools , you ca n't not use them . 
Once you have this knowledge , you ca n't un - know it . 
You ca n't delete this data from your brain , but you can delete the cliched image of supplicant , impoverished peoples not taking control of their own lives . 
You can erase that , you really can , because it 's not true anymore . 
It 's transformational . 
2030 ? By 2030 , robots , not just serving us Guinness , but drinking it . 
By the time we get there , every place with a rough semblance of governance might actually be on their way . 
So I 'm here to -- I guess we 're here to try and infect you with this virtuous , data - based virus , the one we call factivism . 
It 's not going to kill you . 
In fact , it could save countless lives . 
I guess we in the One Campaign would love you to be contagious , spread it , share it , pass it on . 
By doing so , you will join us and countless others in what I truly believe is the greatest adventure ever taken , the ever - demanding journey of equality . 
Could we really be the great generation that Mandela asked us to be ? 
Might we answer that clarion call with science , with reason , with facts , and , dare I say it , emotions ? 
Because as is obvious , factivists have feelings too . 
I 'm thinking of Wael Ghonim , though . 
Some of you know him . He set up one of the Facebook groups behind the Tahrir Square in Cairo . 
He got thrown in jail for it , but I have his words tattooed on my brain . 
" We are going to win because we do n't understand politics . 
We are going to win because we do n't play their dirty games . 
We are going to win because we do n't have a party political agenda . 
We are going to win because the tears that come from our eyes actually come from our hearts . 
We are going to win because we have dreams , and we 're willing to stand up for those dreams . " 
Wael is right . 
We 're going to win if we work together as one , because the power of the people is so much stronger than the people in power . 
Thank you . 
Thank you so much . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_rothemund_details_dna_folding.html 
In 2007 , Paul Rothemund gave TED a short summary of his specialty , DNA folding . Now he lays out in clear , abundant detail the immense promise of this field -- to create tiny machines that assemble themselves .

Paul Rothemund details DNA folding 
So , people argue vigorously about the definition of life . 
They ask if it should have reproduction in it , or metabolism , or evolution . 
And I do n't know the answer to that , so I 'm not going to tell you . 
I will say that life involves computation . 
So this is a computer program . 
Booted up in a cell , the program would execute , and it could result in this person ; or with a small change , it could result in this person ; or another small change , this person ; or with a larger change , this dog , or this tree , or this whale . 
So now , if you take this metaphor [ of ] genome as program seriously , you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer - fabricated artifact , as is Jim Watson , Craig Venter , as are all of us . 
And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true , there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you . 
But one , to me , that 's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development -- the output . 
A small mutation can take a two - wing fly and make it a four - wing fly . 
Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be . 
Or if you 're familiar with " The Princess Bride , " it could create a six - fingered man . 
Now , a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes . 
If your bank account 's one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars . 
So these small changes are things that I think that -- they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified , large changes . 
So now , all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology , and it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does . 
And what I want to do is write molecular programs , potentially to build technology . 
And there are a lot of people doing this , a lot of synthetic biologists doing this , like Craig Venter . 
And they concentrate on using cells . 
They 're cell - oriented . 
So my friends , molecular programmers , and I have a sort of biomolecule - centric approach . 
We 're interested in using DNA , RNA and protein , and building new languages for building things from the bottom up , using biomolecules , potentially having nothing to do with biology . 
So , these are all the machines in a cell . 
There 's a camera . 
There 's the solar panels of the cell , some switches that turn your genes on and off , the girders of the cell , motors that move your muscles . 
My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA . 
We 're not DNA zealots , but DNA is the cheapest , easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this . 
And as other things become easier to use -- maybe protein -- we 'll work with those . 
If we succeed , what will molecular programming look like ? 
You 're going to sit in front of your computer . 
You 're going to design something like a cell phone , and in a high - level language , you 'll describe that cell phone . 
Then you 're going to have a compiler that 's going to take that description and it 's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed . 
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately , is it will do a developmental computation , a molecular computation , and it 'll build an electronic computer . 
And if I have n't revealed my prejudices already , I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers , building electronic computers , which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers , which will build new electronic computers , and so forth . 
And if you buy all of this , and you think life is about computation , as I do , then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist . 
So one big question is , how does a baby know when to stop growing ? 
And for molecular programming , the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing ? 
Or how does a computer program know when to stop running ? 
Or more to the point , how do you know if a program will ever stop ? 
There are other questions like this , too . 
One of them is Craig Venter 's question . 
Turns out I think he 's actually a computer scientist . 
He asked , how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism ? 
How few genes can I use ? 
This is exactly analogous to the question , what 's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word ? 
And just as he 's writing , you know , bacteria that will be smaller , he 's writing genomes that will work , we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does . 
But for molecular programming , our question is , how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone ? 
What 's the smallest number we can get away with ? 
Now , these are big questions in computer science . 
These are all complexity questions , and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions . 
Almost -- many of them are impossible . 
But for some tasks , we can start to answer them . 
So , I 'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I 'm going to talk about next . 
So , this is normal DNA , what you think of as normal DNA . 
It 's double - stranded , it 's a double helix , has the As , Ts , Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together . 
And I 'm going to draw it like this sometimes , just so I do n't scare you . 
We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix . 
When we synthesize it , it comes single - stranded , so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube , and they 're floppy when they 're single - stranded . 
You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix . 
Now for the last 25 years , Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three - dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together . 
But a lot of their approaches , though elegant , take a long time . 
They can take a couple of years , or it can be difficult to design . 
So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago I call DNA origami that 's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop . 
But to do it , you need a long , single strand of DNA , which is technically very difficult to get . 
So , you can go to a natural source . 
You can look in this computer - fabricated artifact , and he 's got a double - stranded genome -- that 's no good . 
You look in his intestines . There are billions of bacteria . 
They 're no good either . 
Double strand again , but inside them , they 're infected with a virus that has a nice , long , single - stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper . 
And here 's how we do it . 
This is part of that genome . 
We add a bunch of short , synthetic DNAs that I call staples . 
Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place , and a right half that binds it in a different place , and brings the long strand together like this . 
The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle . 
Now , we ca n't actually take a movie of this process , but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it . 
And what happens is that we mix these strands together . 
We heat them up , we add a little bit of salt , we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure . 
And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there . 
When you look at DNA origami , you can see that what it really is , even though you think it 's complicated , is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other , and they 're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one . 
So there 's a strand that goes like this , goes along one helix and binds -- it jumps to another helix and comes back . 
That holds the long strand like this . 
Now , to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted , I tried to make this shape . 
I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye , down the nose , up the nose , around the forehead , back down and end in a little loop like this . 
And so , I thought , if this could work , anything could work . 
So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this . 
I ordered them ; they came by FedEx . 
I mixed them up , heated them , cooled them down , and I got 50 billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water . 
And each one of these is just one - thousandth the width of a human hair , OK ? 
So , they 're all floating around in solution , and to look at them , you have to get them on a surface where they stick . 
So , you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface , and we take a picture using an atomic - force microscope . 
It 's got a needle , like a record needle , that goes back and forth over the surface , bumps up and down , and feels the height of the first surface . 
It feels the DNA origami . 
There 's the atomic - force microscope working and you can see that the landing 's a little rough . 
When you zoom in , they 've got , you know , weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out , but it 's pretty good . 
You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop , this little nano - goatee . 
Now , what 's great about this is anybody can do this . 
And so , I got this in the mail about a year after I did this , unsolicited . 
Anyone know what this is ? What is it ? 
It 's China , right ? 
So , what happened is , a graduate student in China , Lulu Qian , did a great job . 
She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami , a beautiful rendition of China , which even has Taiwan , and you can see it 's sort of on the world 's shortest leash , right ? 
So , this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes , OK ? 
And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA . 
And what 's really neat about it -- well , actually , this all looks like nano - artwork , but it turns out that nano - artwork is just what you need to make nano - circuits . 
So , you can put circuit components on the staples , like a light bulb and a light switch . 
Let the thing assemble , and you 'll get some kind of a circuit . 
And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over . 
So , this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did . 
They took a DNA origami , organized some carbon nano - tubes , made a little switch , you see here , wired it up , tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch . 
Now , this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer , so we have a long way to go . 
But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one - tenth the size of those in a normal computer . 
So it 's very promising for making small computers . 
Now , I want to get back to that compiler . 
The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works . 
So , you start with something in the computer . 
You get a high - level description of the computer program , a high - level description of the origami . 
You can compile it to molecules , send it to a synthesizer , and it actually works . 
And it turns out that a company has made a nice program that 's much better than my code , which was kind of ugly , and will allow us to do this in a nice , visual , computer - aided design way . 
So , now you can say , all right , why is n't DNA origami the end of the story ? 
You have your molecular compiler , you can do whatever you want . 
The fact is that it does not scale . 
So if you want to build a human from DNA origami , the problem is , you need a long strand that 's 10 trillion trillion bases long . 
That 's three light years ' worth of DNA , so we 're not going to do this . 
We 're going to turn to another technology , called algorithmic self - assembly of tiles . 
It was started by Erik Winfree , and what it does , it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami . 
You zoom in , there are just four DNA strands and they have little single - stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles , if they match . 
And we like to draw these tiles as little squares . 
And if you look at their sticky ends , these little DNA bits , you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern . 
So , these tiles would make a complicated , self - assembling checkerboard . 
And the point of this , if you did n't catch that , is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns . 
And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs -- specifically , counting . 
So , you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together , form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard . 
So you can read off binary numbers five , six and seven . 
And in order to get these kinds of computations started right , you need some kind of input , a kind of seed . 
You can use DNA origami for that . 
You can encode the number 32 in the right - hand side of a DNA origami , and when you add those tiles that count , they will start to count -- they will read that 32 and they 'll stop at 32 . 
So , what we 've done is we 've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going . 
It knows when to stop growing because it can count . 
It knows how big it is . 
So , that answers that sort of first question I was talking about . 
It does n't tell us how babies do it , however . 
So now , we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise . 
Here 's the DNA origami , and what we can do is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami , and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles , and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square . 
The counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing . 
So , what we 've done is we 've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles . 
And the neat thing about it is , is that it 's also reprogrammable . 
You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you 'll get 96 rather than 32 . 
And if you do that , the origami 's the same size , but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger . 
So , this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development . 
You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes -- single , tiny , little mutations -- can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger . 
Now , this -- using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter 's question . 
So , you can ask , how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size ? 
If we wanted to make a square of size 10 , 100 or 1,000 , if we used DNA origami alone , we would require a number of DNA strands that 's the square of the size of that square ; so we 'd need 100 , 10,000 or a million DNA strands . 
That 's really not affordable . 
But if we use a little computation -- we use origami , plus some tiles that count -- then we can get away with using 100 , 200 or 300 DNA strands . 
And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use , if we use counting , if we use a little bit of computation . 
And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something , to reduce the size of the genome that you 're building . 
And finally , I 'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers . 
If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it , the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory . 
So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles -- rather than to the staple strands , you affix them to the tiles -- then they 'll self - assemble the somewhat complicated circuits , the demultiplexer circuits , that you need to address this memory . 
So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation . 
It 's a molecular computer building an electronic computer . 
Now , you ask me , how far have we gotten down this path ? 
Experimentally , this is what we 've done in the last year . 
Here is a DNA origami rectangle , and here are some tiles growing from it . 
And you can see how they count . 
One , two , three , four , five , six , nine , 10 , 11 , 12 , 17 . 
So it 's got some errors , but at least it counts up . 
So , it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago , and that 's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things , so I think we made a lot of progress . 
We 've got ideas about how to fix these errors . 
And I think in the next five or 10 years , we 'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self - assembled circuits . 
So now , what do I want you to take away from this talk ? 
I want you to remember that to create life 's very diverse and complex forms , life uses computation to do that . 
And the computations that it uses , they 're molecular computations , and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it , as Feynman said , you know , we need to build something to understand it . 
And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing , rebuild everything from the bottom up , using DNA in ways that nature never intended , using DNA origami , and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self - assembly . 
You know , so this is all very cool , but what I 'd like you to take from the talk , hopefully from some of those big questions , is that this molecular programming is n't just about making gadgets . 
It 's not just making about -- it 's making self - assembled cell phones and circuits . 
What it 's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light , asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things . Thank you .

Shaffi Mather explains why he left his first career to become a social entrepreneur , providing life - saving transportation with his company 1298 for Ambulance . Now , he has a new idea and plans to begin a company to fight the booming business of corruption in public service , eliminating it one bribe at a time .

Shaffi Mather : A new way to fight corruption 
The anger in me against corruption made me to make a big career change last year , becoming a full - time practicing lawyer . 
My experiences over the last 18 months , as a lawyer , has seeded in me a new entrepreneurial idea , which I believe is indeed worth spreading . 
So , I share it with all of you here today , though the idea itself is getting crystallized and I 'm still writing up the business plan . 
Of course it helps that fear of public failure diminishes as the number of ideas which have failed increases . 
I 've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship since 1993 . 
I 've explored , experienced , and experimented enterprise and capitalism to my heart 's content . 
I built , along with my two brothers , the leading real estate company in my home state , Kerala , and then worked professionally with two of India 's biggest businessmen , but in their startup enterprises . 
In 2003 , when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector to work on so - called social sector issues , I definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for - profit solutions to addressing pressing public issues . 
When life brought about a series of death and near - death experiences within my close circle , which highlighted the need for an emergency medical response service in India , similar to 911 in USA . 
To address this , I , along with four friends , founded Ambulance Access for All , to promote life - support ambulance services in India . 
For those from the developing world , there is nothing , absolutely nothing new in this idea . 
But as we envisioned it , we had three key goals : Providing world - class life support ambulance service which is fully self - sustainable from its own revenue streams , and universally accessible to anyone in a medical emergency , irrespective of the capability to pay . 
The service which grew out of this , Dial 1298 for Ambulance , with one ambulance in 2004 , now has a hundred - plus ambulances in three states , and has transported over 100,000 patients and victims since inception . 
The service is -- fully self - sustainable from its own revenues , without accessing any public funds , and the cross - subsidy model actually works , where the rich pays higher , poor pays lower , and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge . 
The service responded effectively and efficiently , during the unfortunate 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks . 
And as you can see from the visuals , the service was responding and rescuing victims from the incident locations even before the police could cordon off the incident locations and formally confirm it as a terror strike . 
We ended up being the first medical response team in every incident location and transported 125 victims , saving life . 
In tribute and remembrance of 26/11 attacks over the last one year , we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO , Aman Foundation , to set up a self - sustainable life support ambulance service in Karachi , facilitated by Acumen Fund . 
It 's a small message from us , in our own small way to the enemies of humanity , of Islam , of South Asia , of India , and of Pakistan , that humanity will continue to bloom , irrespective of such dastardly attacks . 
Since then I 've also co - founded two other social enterprises . 
One is Education Access for All , setting up schools in small - town India . 
And the other is Moksha - Yug Access , which is integrating rural supply chain on the foundations of self - help group - based microfinance . 
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right . 
Because diligent investors and venture funds have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding . 
With the significance being these funds have come in as a QT capital , not as grant or as philanthropy . 
Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise that I 'm exploring . 
Corruption , bribes , and lack of transparency . 
You may be surprised to know that eight speakers yesterday actually mentioned these terms in their talks . 
Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side , with the supply side being mostly of greedy corporate unethical businesses and hapless common man . 
And the demand side being mostly politicians , bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power vested with them . 
According to World Bank estimate , one trillion dollars is paid in bribes every year , worsening the condition of the already worse off . 
Yet , if you analyze the common man , he or she does not wake up every day and say , " Hmm , let me see who I can pay a bribe to today . " 
or , " Let me see who I can corrupt today . " 
Often it is the constraining or the back - to - the - wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe . 
In the modern day world , where time is premium and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough , the hapless common man simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life . 
Now , let me ask you another question . 
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe in your day - to - day life to get something done . 
What do you do ? Of course you can call the police . 
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption ? 
Most definitely you do n't want to pay the bribe . 
But you also do n't have the time , resources , expertise or wherewithal to fight this . 
Unfortunately , many of us in this room are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces . 
Yet the market forces around the world have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in , pay a fee , and fight the demand for a bribe . 
Like a bribe buster service , or 1 - 800-Fight - Bribes , or www.stopbribes.org or www.preventcorruption.org . 
Such a service simply do not exist . 
One image that has haunted me from my early business days is of a grandmother , 70 plus years , being harassed by the bureaucrats in the town planning office . 
All she needed was permission to build three steps to her house , from ground level , making it easier for her to enter and exit her house . 
Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit for want of a bribe . 
Even though it pricked my conscience then , I could not , or rather I did not tend to her or assist her , because I was busy building my real estate company . 
I do n't want to be haunted by such images any more . 
A group of us have been working on a pilot basis to address individual instances of demands for bribes for common services or entitlement . 
And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the Right to Information Act , video , audio , or peer pressure , we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe . 
And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower than the bribe demanded . 
I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases can be consolidated in standard processes in a BPO kind of environment , and made available on web , call - center and franchise physical offices , for a fee , to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe . 
The target market is as tempting as it can get . 
It can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in bribes every year , or equal to India 's GDP . 
And it is an absolutely virgin market . 
I propose to explore this idea further , to examine the potential of creating a for - profit , fee - based BPO kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption . 
I do realize that the fight for justice against corruption is never easy . 
It never has been and it never will be . 
In my last 18 months as a lawyer , battling small- and large - scale corruption , including the one perpetrated by India 's biggest corporate scamster . 
Through his charities I have had three police cases filed against me alleging trespass , impersonation and intimidation . 
The battle against corruption exacts a toll on ourselves , our families , our friends , and even our kids . 
Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on to our dignity and making the world a fairer place . 
What gives us the courage ? 
As my close friend replied , when told during the seeding days of the ambulance project that it is an impossible task and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue - chip jobs , I quote : " Of course we can not fail in this , at least in our own minds . 
For we are insane people , trying to do an impossible task . 
And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is . " Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Shaffi , that is a really exciting business idea . 
Shaffi Mather : I just have to get through the initial days where I do n't get eliminated . 
CA : What 's on your mind ? 
I mean , give us a sense of the numbers here -- a typical bribe and a typical fee . I mean , what 's in your head ? 
SM : So let me ... Let me give you an example . 
Somebody who had applied for the passport . 
The officer was just sitting on it and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes . 
And he did not want to pay . 
So we actually used the Right to Information Act , which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States , and pushed back the officers in this particular case . 
And in all these 42 cases , when we kept pushing them back , there was three kinds of reaction . 
A set of people actually say , " Oh , let me just grant it to them , and run away from it . " 
Some people actually come back and say , " Oh , you want to screw me . Let me show you what I can do . " 
And he will push us back . 
So you take the next step , or use the next tool available in what we are putting together , and then he relents . 
By the third time , in all 42 cases , we have achieved success . 
CA : But if it 's a 3,000-rupee , 70-dollar bribe , what fee would you have to charge , and can you actually make the business work ? 
SM : Well , actually the cost that we incurred was less than 200 rupees . 
So , it actually works . 
CA : That 's a high gross margin business . I like it . 
SM : I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage . 
CA : OK , so these are provisional numbers , no pricing guarantee . 
If you can pull this off , you will be a global hero . 
I mean , this could be huge . 
Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED .

Barry Schwartz on our loss of wisdom 
In his inaugural address , Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis . 
But what did he appeal to ? 
He did not , happily , follow in the footsteps of his predecessor , and tell us to just go shopping . 
Nor did he tell us , " Trust us . Trust your country . 
Invest , invest , invest . " 
Instead , what he told us was to put aside childish things . 
And he appealed to virtue . 
Virtue is an old - fashioned word . 
It seems a little out of place in a cutting - edge environment like this one . 
And besides , some of you might be wondering , what the hell does it mean ? 
Let me begin with an example . 
This is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen . 
And all of the items on it are unremarkable . 
They 're the things you would expect : mop the floors , sweep them , empty the trash , restock the cabinets . 
It may be a little surprising how many things there are , but it 's not surprising what they are . 
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this : even though this is a very long list , there is n't a single thing on it that involves other human beings . 
Not one . 
The janitor 's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital . 
And yet , when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like , they encountered Mike , who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise , trying to build up his strength , walking slowly up and down the hall . 
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor 's admonition and did n't vacuum the visitor 's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day , every day who , at this moment , happened to be taking a nap . 
And then there was Luke , who washed the floor in a comatose young man 's room twice because the man 's father , who had been keeping a vigil for six months , did n't see Luke do it the first time , and his father was angry . 
And behavior like this from janitors , from technicians , from nurses and , if we 're lucky now and then , from doctors , does n't just make people feel a little better , it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well . 
Now , not all janitors are like this , of course . 
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness , care and empathy are an essential part of the job . 
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings . 
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people . 
And beyond this , they have the moral skill to figure out what " doing right " means . 
" Practical wisdom , " Aristotle told us , " is the combination of moral will and moral skill . " 
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule , as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives . 
A wise person knows how to improvise , as Luke did when he re - washed the floor . 
Real - world problems are often ambiguous and ill - defined and the context is always changing . 
A wise person is like a jazz musician -- using the notes on the page , but dancing around them , inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand . 
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims . 
To serve other people , not to manipulate other people . 
And finally , perhaps most important , a wise person is made , not born . 
Wisdom depends on experience , and not just any experience . 
You need the time to get to know the people that you 're serving . 
You need permission to be allowed to improvise , try new things , occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures . 
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers . 
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job , they tell you that it takes lots of experience . 
And they do n't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans . 
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people . 
At TED , brilliance is rampant . 
It 's scary . 
The good news is you do n't need to be brilliant to be wise . 
The bad news is that without wisdom , brilliance is n't enough . 
It 's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else . 
Now , I hope that we all know this . 
There 's a sense in which it 's obvious , and yet , let me tell you a little story . 
It 's a story about lemonade . 
A dad and his seven - year - old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark . 
His son asked him for some lemonade and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it . 
All they had was Mike 's Hard Lemonade , which was five percent alcohol . 
Dad , being an academic , had no idea that Mike 's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol . 
So he brought it back . 
And the kid was drinking it , and a security guard spotted it , and called the police , who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark , whisked the kid to the hospital . 
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood . 
And they were ready to let the kid go . 
But not so fast . 
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no . 
And the child was sent to a foster home for three days . 
At that point , can the child go home ? 
Well , a judge said yes , but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel . 
After two weeks , I 'm happy to report , the family was reunited . 
But the welfare workers and the ambulance people and the judge all said the same thing : " We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure . " 
How do things like this happen ? 
Scott Simon , who told this story on NPR , said , " Rules and procedures may be dumb , but they spare you from thinking . " 
And , to be fair , rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household . 
Fair enough . 
When things go wrong , as of course they do , we reach for two tools to try to fix them . 
One tool we reach for is rules . 
Better ones , more of them . 
The second tool we reach for is incentives . 
Better ones , more of them . 
What else , after all , is there ? 
We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis . 
Regulate , regulate , regulate . 
Fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ... 
The truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job . 
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did ? 
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic ? 
It 's preposterous on its face . 
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules , rules and incentives may make things better in the short run , but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run . 
Moral skill is chipped away by an over - reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations . 
And moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing . 
And without intending it , by appealing to rules and incentives , we are engaging in a war on wisdom . 
Let me just give you a few examples , first of rules and the war on moral skill . 
The lemonade story is one . 
Second , no doubt more familiar to you , is the nature of modern American education : scripted , lock - step curricula . 
Here 's an example from Chicago kindergarten . 
Reading and enjoying literature and words that begin with ' B. ' " The Bath : " Assemble students on a rug and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water . 
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book . 
All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city , every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day . 
We know why these scripts are there . 
We do n't trust the judgment of teachers enough to let them loose on their own . 
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster . 
And they prevent disaster . 
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity . 
Do n't get me wrong . We need rules ! 
Jazz musicians need some notes -- most of them need some notes on the page . 
We need more rules for the bankers , God knows . 
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising . 
And as a result , they lose their gifts , or worse , they stop playing altogether . 
Now , how about incentives ? 
They seem cleverer . 
If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing , it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you 're more likely to do it . 
Right ? 
Well , not always . 
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another instead of complimenting , and they make people less likely to do it . 
I 'll just give you one example because time is racing . 
In Switzerland , back about 15 years ago , they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps . 
There was going to be a national referendum . 
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed . 
And they said , " Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ? " 
Astonishingly , 50 percent of the citizens said yes . 
They knew it was dangerous . 
They thought it would reduce their property values . 
But it had to go somewhere and they had responsibilities as citizens . 
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question . 
They said , " If we paid you six weeks ' salary every year would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community ? " 
Two reasons . It 's my responsibility and I 'm getting paid . 
Instead of 50 percent saying yes , 25 percent said yes . 
What happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking , " What is my responsibility ? " 
all we ask is , " What serves my interests ? " 
When incentives do n't work , when CEOs ignore the long - term health of their companies in pursuit of short - term gains that will lead to massive bonuses , the response is always the same . 
Get smarter incentives . 
The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise that are ever going to be smart enough . 
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will . 
We need incentives . People have to make a living . 
But excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word . 
It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale and it causes the activity itself to lose morality . 
Barack Obama said , before he was inaugurated , " We must ask not just ' Is it profitable ? ' but ' Is it right ? ' " And when professions are demoralized , everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives and they stop asking " Is it right ? " 
We see this in medicine . 
And we certainly see it in the world of business . 
It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work . 
So what can we do ? 
A few sources of hope : we ought to try to re - moralize work . 
One way not to do it : teach more ethics courses . 
There is no better way to show people that you 're not serious than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course . 
What to do instead ? 
One : Celebrate moral exemplars . 
Acknowledge , when you go to law school , that a little voice is whispering in your ear about Atticus Finch . 
No 10-year - old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions . 
People are inspired by moral heroes . 
But we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you ca n't acknowledge that you have moral heroes . 
Well , acknowledge them . 
Be proud that you have them . 
Celebrate them . 
And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too . 
That 's one thing we can do . 
I do n't know how many of you remember this : another moral hero , 15 years ago , Aaron Feuerstein , who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts -- they made Polartec -- The factory burned down . 
3,000 employees . He kept every one of them on the payroll . 
Why ? Because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go . 
" Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street , but I can tell you it 's worth more . We 're doing fine . " 
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes . 
Two were particularly inspiring to me . 
One was Ray Anderson , who turned -- -- turned , you know , a part of the evil empire into a zero - footprint , or almost zero - footprint business . 
Why ? Because it was the right thing to do . 
And a bonus he 's discovering is he 's actually going to make even more money . 
His employees are inspired by the effort . 
Why ? Because there happy to be doing something that 's the right thing to do . 
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re - foresting in Indonesia . 
In many ways this is the perfect example . 
Because it took the will to do the right thing . 
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill . 
I 'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out . 
But most important to make it work -- and he emphasized this -- is that it took knowing the people in the communities . 
Unless the people you 're working with are behind you , this will fail . 
And there is n't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you , because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways . 
So there 's a lot here at TED , and at other places , to celebrate . 
And you do n't have to be a mega - hero . 
There are ordinary heroes . 
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too . 
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary , if not extraordinary heroes . 
As heads of organizations , we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will . 
Even the wisest and most well - meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work . 
If you run an organization , you should be sure that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs -- have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors . 
Because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work . 
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom . 
And , perhaps most important , as teachers , we should strive to be the ordinary heroes , the moral exemplars , to the people we mentor . 
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers . 
One is that we are always teaching . 
Someone is always watching . 
The camera is always on . 
Bill Gates talked about the importance of education and , in particular , the model that KIPP was providing : " Knowledge is power . " 
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things that KIPP is doing to take inner - city kids and turn them in the direction of college . 
I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing that Bill did n't mention . 
That is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character . 
They need to learn to respect themselves . 
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates . 
They need to learn to respect their teachers . 
And , most important , they need to learn to respect learning . 
That 's the principle objective . 
If you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill . 
And the teachers : the way you teach these things to the kids is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day . 
Obama appealed to virtue . 
And I think he was right . 
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom , because it 's what allows other virtues -- honesty , kindness , courage and so on -- to be displayed at the right time and in the right way . 
He also appealed to hope . 
Right again . 
I think there is reason for hope . 
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous . 
In many ways , it 's what TED is all about . 
Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons . 
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention . 
Paying attention to what we do , to how we do it , and , perhaps most importantly , to the structure of the organizations within which we work , so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : You have to go and stand out here a sec . 
Barry Schwartz : Thank you very much .

Soldiers who 've lost limbs in service face a daily struggle unimaginable to most of us . At TEDMED , Dean Kamen talks about the profound people and stories that motivated his work to give parts of their lives back with his design for a remarkable prosthetic arm .

Dean Kamen : The emotion behind invention 
It 's not about technology , it 's about people and stories . 
I could show you what recently was on television as a high quality video : 60 Minutes , many of you may have seen it . 
And it was the now director of the entire piece of the veteran 's administration -- who , himself , had lost an arm 39 years ago in Vietnam -- who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices that do n't work . 
And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background , after he pretty much made his position clear on this -- he had his hook and he had his -- he wore this arm for less than two hours and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact that , quote -- his quote -- it 's the first time he 's felt like he 's had an arm in 39 years . 
But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story , and I 'm not going to show you that polished video . 
I 'm going to , instead , in a minute or two , show you an early , crude video because I think it 's a better way to tell a story . 
A few years ago I was visited by the guy that runs DARPA , the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and universities probably would n't take the risk of doing . 
They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers . 
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit , and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon from the military and the guy that runs DARPA . 
They proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following . We have used such advanced technologies now and made them available in the most remote places that we put soldiers : hills of Afghanistan , Iraq ... 
They were quite proud of the fact that you know , before the dust clears , if some soldier has been hurt they will have collected him or her , they will have brought him back , they will be getting world - class triage emergency care faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt in a car accident in a major city in the United States . 
That 's the good news . 
The bad news is if they 've collected this person and he or she is missing an arm or leg , part of the face , it 's probably not coming back . 
So , they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm . 
And then the surgeon pointed out , with a lot of anger , he said , " Why is it ? At the end of the Civil War , they were shooting each other with muskets . If somebody lost an arm , we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it . 
Now we 've got F18s and F22s , and if somebody loses an arm , we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it . " 
And they basically said , " This is unacceptable , " and then the punchline : " So , Dean , we 're here because you make medical stuff . 
You 're going to give us an arm . " 
And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy , paperwork and DODs . 
No , the guy says , " We 're going to bring a guy into this conference room , and wearing the arm you 're going to give us , he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape off this table . 
If it 's the grape , they wo n't break it . " 
Great he needs efferent , afferent , haptic response sensors . 
" If it 's the raisin , they wo n't drop it . " 
So he wants fine motor control : flex at the wrist , flex at the elbow , abduct and flex at the shoulder . 
Either way they were going to eat it . 
" Oh , by the way Dean . It 's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame -- namely 32 inches from the long finger -- and weigh less than nine pounds . " 
50th percentile female frame . 
" And it 's going to be completely self contained including all its power . " 
So , they finished that . And I , as you can tell , am a bashful guy . 
I told them they 're nuts . 
They 've been watching too much " Terminator . " 
Then , the surgeon says to me , " Dean , you need to know more than two dozen of these kids have come back bilateral . " 
Now , I can not imagine -- I 'm sorry , you may have a better imagination than I do -- I ca n't imagine losing my arm , and typically at 22 years old . 
But compared to that , losing two ? 
Seems like that would be an inconvenience . 
Anyway , I went home that night . I thought about it . 
I literally could not sleep thinking about , " I wonder how you 'd roll over with no shoulders . " 
So , I decided we 've got to do this . 
And trust me , I 've got a day job , I 've got a lot of day jobs . 
Most of my day job keeps me busy funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power .... 
And I 've got a lot of day jobs . 
But I figured I got ta do this . 
Did a little investigation , went down to Washington , told them I still think they 're nuts but we 're going to do it . 
And I told them I 'd build them an arm . 
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA , and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional . 
Look what it takes to make things like iPods . 
" Great , " he said , " You got two years . " 
I said , " I 'll tell you what . I 'll build you an arm that 's under nine pounds that has all that capability in one year . 
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful . " 
We sort of agreed to disagree . 
I went back and I started putting a team together , the best guys I could find with a passion to do this . 
At the end of exactly one year we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom , all the sensors , all the microprocessors , all the stuff inside . 
I could show you it with a cosmesis on it that 's so real it 's eerie , but then you would n't see all this cool stuff . 
I then thought it would be years before we 'd be able to make it really , really useful . 
It turned out , as I think you could see in Aimee 's capabilities and attitudes , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable . 
Anyway , with less than 10 hours of use , two guys -- one that 's bilateral . 
He 's literally , he 's got no shoulder on one side , and he 's high trans - humeral on the other . 
And that 's Chuck and Randy together , after 10 hours -- were playing in our office . 
And we took some pretty cruddy home movies . 
At the end of the one I 'm going to show , it 's only about a minute and a couple of seconds long , Chuck does something that to this day I 'm jealous of , I ca n't do it . 
He picks up a spoon , picks it up , scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk , holds the spoon level as he translates it , moving all these joints simultaneously , to his mouth , and he does n't drop any milk . 
I can not do that . 
His wife was standing behind me . 
She 's standing behind me at the time and she says , " Dean , Chuck has n't fed himself in 19 years . 
So , you 've got a choice : We keep the arm , or you keep Chuck . " 
So , can we see that ? 
This is Chuck showing simultaneous control of all the joints . 
He 's punching our controls guy . The guy behind him is our engineer / surgeon , which is a convenient guy to have around . 
There 's Randy , these guys are passing a rubber little puck between them . 
And just as in the spirit of FIRST , gracious professionalism , they are quite proud of this , so they decide to share a drink . 
This is a non - trivial thing to do , by the way . 
Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it , doing either of those . 
Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary , at least for my limited physical skill . 
And now he 's going to do what DARPA asked me for . 
He 's going to pick up a grape -- he did n't drop it , he did n't break it -- and he 's going to eat it . 
So , that 's where we were at the end of about 15 months . 
But , as I 've learned from Richard , the technology , the processors , the sensors , the motors , is not the story . 
I had n't dealt with this kind of problem or frankly , this whole segment of the medical world . 
I 'll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this . 
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design , and we 'd have to make all the standard engineering trade - offs you always make -- you can always get three out of four of anything you want ; the weight , the size , the cost , the functionality -- I put a bunch of guys in my plane and I said , " We 're flying down to Walter Reed , and we 're going talk to these kids , because frankly it does n't matter whether we like this arm . 
It does n't matter whether the Department of Defense likes this arm . " 
When I told them that they were n't entirely enthusiastic , but I told them , " It really does n't matter what their opinion is . 
There is only one opinion that matters , the kids that are either going to use it or not . " 
I told a bunch of my engineers , " Look we 're going to walk into Walter Reed , and you 're going to see people , lots of them , missing major body parts . 
They 're probably going to be angry , depressed , frustrated . 
We 're probably going to have to give them support , encouragement . 
But we 've got to extract from them enough information to make sure we 're doing the right thing . " 
We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong . 
We did see a bunch of people , a lot of them missing a lot of body parts , and parts they had left were burned ; half a face gone , an ear burned off . 
They were sitting at a table . They were brought together for us . 
And we started asking them all questions . 
" Look , " I 'd say to them , " We 're not quite as good as nature yet . 
I could give you fine motor control , or I could let you curl 40 pounds ; I probably ca n't do both . 
I can give you fast control with low reduction ratios in these gears , or I can give you power ; I ca n't give you both . 
And we were trying to get them to all help us know what to give them . 
Not only were they enthusiastic , they kept thinking they 're there to help us . 
" Well , would it help if I ... " 
" Guys , and woman , you 've given enough . 
We 're here to help you . We need data . We need to know what you need . " 
After a half an hour , maybe , there was one guy at the far end of the table who was n't saying much . 
You could see he was missing an arm . 
He was leaning on his other arm . 
I called down to the end , " Hey , you have n't said much . 
If we needed this or this , what would you want ? " 
And he said , " You know , I 'm the lucky guy at this table . 
I lost my right arm , but I 'm a lefty . " 
So , he would n't say much . 
He had a great spirit , like all the rest of them had great spirits . 
And he made a few comments . 
And then the meeting ended . We said goodbye to all these guys . 
And that guy pushed himself back from the table ... 
he has no legs . 
So , we left . 
And I was thinking , " We did n't give them support and encouragement ; they gave it to us . 
They 're not finished giving yet . " 
It was astounding . 
So , we went back . 
And I started working harder , faster . 
Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center . 
And we saw lots of these kids , lots of them . 
And it was astounding how positive they are . 
So , we went back , and we 've been working harder yet . 
We 're in clinical trials , we 've got five of them on people . 
We 're screaming along . 
And I get a call and we go back to Washington . 
We go back to Walter Reed , and a kid , literally , 20 some - odd days before that was blown up . 
And they shipped him to Germany and 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany to Walter Reed . 
And he was there , and they said we needed to come . 
And I went down and they rolled him into a room . 
He 's got no legs . 
He 's got no arms . 
He 's got a small residual limb on one side . 
Half of his face is gone , but they said his vision is coming back . 
He had one good eye . 
His name is Brandon Marrocco . 
And he said , " I need your arms , but I need two of them . " 
" You 'll get them . " 
This kid was from Staten Island . 
And he said , " I had a truck , before I went over there , and it had a stick . 
You think I 'll be able to drive it ? " 
" Sure . " 
And I turned around and went , " How are we going to do this ? " 
Anyway , he was just like all the rest of them . 
He does n't really want a lot . 
He wants to help . He told me that he wanted to go back to help his buddies . 
So , I was on my way out here . 
I was asked to stop at Texas . 
There were 3,500 people , the Veteran 's Administration , U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event to help the families of all the kids -- some that have died , some that are like Brandon -- and they wanted me to speak . 
I said , " What am I going to say ? 
This is not a happy thing . Look , if this happens to you , I can give you ... This stuff is still not as good at the original equipment . " 
" You need to come . " 
So , I went . 
And , as I think you get the point , there were a lot people there recovering . 
Some further along than others . 
But universally , these people that had been through this had astounding attitudes , and just the fact that people care makes a huge difference to them . 
I 'll shut up , except one message or concern I have . 
I do n't think anybody does it intentionally , but there were people there literally talking about , " Well , how much will they get ? " 
You know , this country is involved as we 've all heard , in this great healthcare debate . 
" Who is entitled to what ? 
Who is entitled to how much ? 
Who is going to pay for it ? " 
Those are tough questions . 
I do n't have an answer to that . Not everybody can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here . 
It 's not possible . It would be nice but let 's be realistic . 
They were tough questions . There 's polarized groups down there . 
I do n't know the answers . 
There are other questions that are tough . 
" Should we be there ? 
How do we get out ? 
What do we need to do ? " There 's very polarized answers to that question too , and I do n't have any answers to that . 
Those are political questions , economic questions , strategic questions . 
I do n't have the answer . But let me give you a simple concern or maybe statement , then . 
It is an easy answer . 
I know what these kids deserve on the healthcare side . 
I was talking to one of them , and he was really liking this arm -- it 's way , way , way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it -- but there 's nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got . 
But I was saying to him , " You know , the first airplane went 100 feet in 1903 . 
Wilbur and Orville . 
But you know what ? It would n't have made an old pigeon jealous . 
But now we got Eagles out there , F15s , even that Bald Eagle . 
I 've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2 . 
I think eventually we 'll make these things extraordinary . " 
And I said to that kid , " I 'll stop when your buddies are envious of your Luke arm because of what it can do , and how it does it . 
And we 'll keep working . And I 'm not going to stop working until we do that . " 
And I think this country ought to continue its great debate , whining and complaining , " I 'm entitled . " " You 're a victim . " 
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be . 
But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about who 's paying for what and how much we get , the people that are out there giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining , I know what they deserve : everything humanly possible . 
And we ought to give it to them .

David Blaine : How I held my breath for 17 min 
As a magician , I try to create images that make people stop and think . 
I also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible . 
I was buried alive in New York City in a coffin , buried alive in a coffin in April , 1999 , for a week . 
I lived there with nothing but water . 
And it ended up being so much fun that I decided I could pursue doing more of these things . 
The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in New York City . 
That one was way more difficult than I had expected . 
The one after that , I stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for 36 hours . 
I began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads . 
So , next I went to London . 
In London I lived in a glass box for 44 days with nothing but water . 
It was , for me , one of the most difficult things I 'd ever done , but it was also the most beautiful . 
There was so many skeptics , especially the press in London , that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me . 
So , I felt very validated when the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science . 
My next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing , like how long I could survive with nothing , not even air . 
I did n't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life . 
As a young magician I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges . 
So , I began , early on , competing against the other kids , seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe , you know , five times , while I stayed under on one breath . 
By the time I was a teenager I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds . 
I would later find out that was Houdini 's personal record . 
In 1987 I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river . 
He was underneath , not breathing for 45 minutes . 
When the rescue workers came they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage . 
His core temperature had dropped to 77 degrees . 
As a magician , I think everything is possible . 
And I think if something is done by one person it can be done by others . 
I started to think , if the boy could survive without breathing for that long , there must be a way that I could do it . 
So , I met with a top neurosurgeon . 
And I asked him , how long is it possible to go without breathing , like how long could I go without air ? 
And he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage . 
So , I took that as a challenge , basically . 
My first try , I figured that I could do something similar , and I created a water tank , and I filled it with ice and freezing cold water . 
And I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop . 
And I was shivering . In my first attempt to hold my breath I could n't even last a minute . 
So , I realized that was completely not going to work . 
So , I went to talk to a doctor friend , and I asked him how could I do that ? 
" I want to hold my breath for a really long time . How could it be done ? " 
And he said , " David , you 're a magician , create the illusion of not breathing , it will be much easier . " 
So , he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather , with a CO2 scrubber , which was basically a tube from Home Depot , with a balloon duct - taped to it , that he thought we could put inside of me , and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe with this thing in me . 
This is a little hard to watch . 
But this is that attempt . 
So , that clearly was n't going to work . 
Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing . 
There is a chemical that 's called perflubron . 
And it 's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it . 
So , I got my hands on that chemical , filled the sink up with it , and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in , which was really impossible . 
It 's basically like trying to breathe , as a doctor said , while having an elephant standing on your chest . 
So , that idea disappeared . 
Then I started thinking , would it be possible to hook up a heart / lung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery , and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood ? 
Which was another insane idea , obviously . 
Then I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas : to actually do it . 
To actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead . 
So , I started researching into pearl divers . 
You know , because they go down for four minutes on one breath . 
And when I was researching pearl divers , I found the world of free - diving . 
It was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered , pretty much . 
There is many different aspects to free - diving . 
There is depth records , where people go as deep as they can . 
And then there is static apnea . 
That 's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving . 
That was the one that I studied . 
The first thing that I learned is when you 're holding your breath you should never move at all ; that wastes energy . 
And that depletes oxygen , and it builds up CO2 in your blood . So , I learned never to move . 
And I learned how to slow my heart rate down . 
I had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that I was n't in my body , and just control that . 
And then I learned how to purge . 
Purging is basically hyperventilating . 
You blow in and out ... 
You do that , you get lightheaded , you get tingling . 
And you 're really ridding your body of CO2 . 
So , when you hold your breath it 's infinitely easier . 
Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath , and just hold and relax and never let any air out , and just hold and relax through all the pain . 
Every morning , this is for months , I would wake up and the first thing that I would do is I would hold my breath for , out of 52 minutes , I would hold my breath for 44 minutes . 
So , basically what that means is I would purge , I 'd breath really hard for a minute . 
And I would hold , immediately after , for five and half minutes . 
Then I would breath again for a minute , purging as hard as I can , then immediately after that I would hold again for five and half minutes . 
I would repeat this process eight times in a row . 
Out of 52 minutes you 're only breathing for eight minutes . 
At the end of that you 're completely fried , your brain . 
You feel like you 're walking around in a daze . 
And you have these awful headaches . 
Basically , I 'm not the best person to talk to when I 'm doing that stuff . 
I started learning about the world - record holder . 
His name is Tom Sietas . 
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath . 
He 's six foot four . He 's 160 pounds . 
And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person . 
I 'm six foot one , and fat . 
We 'll say big - boned . 
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months . 
So , everything that I put into my body I considered as medicine . 
Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value . 
I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day . 
And I started to really adapt my body . 
The thinner I was , the longer I was able to hold my breath . 
And by eating so well and training so hard , my resting heart - rate dropped to 38 beats per minute . 
Which is lower than most Olympic athletes . 
In four months of training I was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes . 
I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere . 
I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress . 
I decided that I was going to break the world record live on prime - time television . 
The world record was eight minutes and 58 seconds , held by Tom Sietas , that guy with the whale lungs I told you about . 
I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln center and if I stayed there a week not eating , I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism , which I was sure would help me hold my breath longer than I had been able to do it . 
I was completely wrong . 
I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date . 
And I thought everything seemed to be on track . 
Two days before my big breath hold attempt , for the record , the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath , and almost drowning , is too boring for television . 
So , I had to add handcuffs , while holding my breath , to escape from . 
This was a critical mistake . 
Because of the movement I was wasting oxygen . 
And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions . 
By 7:08 I started to black out . 
And by seven minutes and 30 seconds they had to pull my body out and bring me back . 
I had failed on every level . 
So , naturally , the only way out of the slump that I could think of was , I decided to call Oprah . 
I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had . 
This was a different record . This was a pure O2 static apnea record that Guinness had set the world record at 13 minutes . 
So , basically you breath pure O2 first , oxygenating your body , flushing out CO2 , and you are able to hold much longer . 
I realized that my real competition was the beaver . 
In January of ' 08 Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train . 
So , I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night . 
A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet . 
So , it 's like base camp Everest . 
What that does is , you start building up the red blood cell count in your body , which helps you carry oxygen better . 
Every morning , again , after getting out of that tent your brain is completely wiped out . 
My first attempt on pure O2 , I was able to go up to 15 minutes . 
So , it was a pretty big success . 
The neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind , at 15 minutes your brain is done , you 're brain dead . 
So , he pulled me up , and I was fine . 
There was one person there that was definitely not impressed . 
It was my ex - girlfriend . While I was breaking the record underwater for the first time , she was sifting through my Blackberry , checking all my messages . 
My brother had a picture of it . It is really ... 
I then announced that I was going to go for Sietas ' record , publicly . 
And what he did in response , is he went on Regis and Kelly , and broke his old record . 
Then his main competitor went out and broke his record . 
So , he suddenly pushed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds . 
Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared . 
You know , it was longer than the record . 
Now , I wanted to get the Science Times to document this . 
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it . 
So , I did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do . 
I walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody . 
So , I do n't know if it was the magic or the lore of the Cayman islands , but John Tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath - holding . 
While he was there I tried to impress him , of course . 
And I did a dive down to 160 feet , which is basically the height of a 16 story building , and as I was coming up , I blacked out underwater , which is really dangerous ; that 's how you drown . 
Luckily Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up . 
So , I started full focus . 
I completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what I needed to do . 
But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it , being on Oprah . 
But in practice , I would do it face down , floating on the pool . 
But for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face , basically . 
The other problem was the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up . 
So , I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose , which was a real problem for me . 
That made me extremely nervous , raising the heart rate . 
Then , what they also did was , which we never did before , is there was a heart - rate monitor . 
And it was right next to the sphere . 
So , every time my heart would beat I 'd hear the beep - beep - beep - beep , you know , the ticking , really loud . 
Which was making me more nervous . 
And there is no way to slow my heart rate down . 
So , normally I would start at 38 beats per minute , and while holding my breath it would drop to 12 beats per minute , which is pretty unusual . 
This time it started at 120 beats , and it never went down . 
I spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down . 
I was just sitting there thinking , " I 've got to slow this down . 
I 'm going to fail , I 'm going to fail . " 
And I was getting more nervous . 
And the heart rate just kept going up and up , all the way up to 150 beats . 
Basically it 's the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center . 
It was a waste of O2 . 
When I made it to the halfway mark , at eight minutes , I was 100 percent certain that I was not going to be able to make this . 
There was no way for me to do it . 
So , I figured , Oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing , if I had cracked early it would be a whole show about how depressed I am . 
So , I figured I 'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out , at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that . 
I kept pushing to 10 minutes . At 10 minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes . 
And I knew that that was blood shunting , when the blood rushes away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs . 
At 11 minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs , and my lips started to feel really strange . 
At minute 12 I started to have ringing in my ears , and I started to feel my arm going numb . 
And I 'm a hypochondriac , and I remember arm numb means heart attack . 
So , I started to really get really paranoid . 
Then at 13 minutes , maybe because of the hypochondria . 
I started feeling pains all over my chest . 
It was awful . 
At 14 minutes , I had these awful contractions , like this urge to breathe . 
At 15 minutes I was suffering major O2 deprivation to the heart . 
And I started having ischemia to the heart . 
My heartbeat would go from 120 , to 50 , to 150 , to 40 , to 20 , to 150 again . 
It would skip a beat . 
It would start . It would stop . And I felt all this . 
And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack . 
So , at 16 minutes what I did is I slid my feet out because I knew that if I did go out , if I did have a heart attack , they 'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up . So , I was really nervous . 
So , I let my feet out , and I started floating to the top . 
And I did n't take my head out . 
But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop , just waiting . 
They had doctors with the " Pst , " you know , so , sitting there waiting . 
And then suddenly I hear screaming . 
And I think that there is some weird thing -- that I had died or something had happened . 
And then I realized that I had made it to 16:32 . 
So , with the energy of everybody that was there I decided to keep pushing . 
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds . 
As though that was n't enough , what I did immediately after is I went to Quest Labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were , so the doctors could use it , once again . 
I also did n't want anybody to question it . 
I had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate . 
So , I get to New York City the next day , and this kid walks up to me -- I 'm walking out of the Apple store -- this kid walks up to me he 's like , " Yo , D ! " 
I 'm like " Yeah ? " 
He said , " If you really held your breath that long , why 'd you come out of the water dry ? " 
I was like " What ? " 
And that 's my life . So ... 
As a magician I try to show things to people that seem impossible . 
And I think magic , whether I 'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards , is pretty simple . 
It 's practice , it 's training , and it 's -- It 's practice , it 's training and experimenting , while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be . 
And that 's what magic is to me , so , thank you .

Andy Hobsbawm says : Do the green thing 
Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity . 
Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful . 
Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea . 
Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ai n't necessarily so . 
Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable . 
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce . 
Creativity is the meme - maker that puts slogans on our t - shirts and phrases on our lips . 
It 's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze . 
Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic . 
This is a time of need . 
Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly . 
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements . 
To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps . 
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I 'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener . 
Man : You know , rather than drive today , I 'm going to walk . 
Narrator : And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things . 
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen . 
A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle . 
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall . 
And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her . 
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart . 
Sure , she had aged a little . 
In fact , she had aged a lot . 
But he felt all his old passion for her return . 
" Ford , " he called softly . For that was her name . 
" Do n't say another word , Gusty , " she said , for that was his name . 
" I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here . 
Let 's go there and make love . In the tent . " 
Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other . 
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer . 
The earth moved for both of them . 
And they lived together happily ever after . 
And all because he decided to walk that day . 
Andy Hobsbawm : We 've got the science , we 've had the debate . 
The moral imperative is on the table . 
Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp . 
To make it connect . To make it make people want to act . 
So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community . 
Let 's get creative against climate change . 
And let 's do it soon . Thank you .

Ashraf Ghani on rebuilding broken states 
A public , Dewey long ago observed , is constituted through discussion and debate . 
If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question , and avoid doxa , the realm of the unquestioned , then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions to debate and discussion . 
It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion of one of the critical issues of our time , namely , how to mobilize different forms of capital for the project of state building . 
To put the assumptions very clearly : capitalism , after 150 years , has become acceptable , and so has democracy . 
If we looked in the world of 1945 and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities , they were the rare exception , not the norm . 
The question now , however , is both about which form of capitalism and which type of democratic participation . 
But we must acknowledge that this moment has brought about a rare consensus of assumptions . 
And that provides the ground for a type of action , because consensus of each moment allows us to act . 
And it is necessary , no matter how fragile or how provisional our consensus , to be able to move forward . 
But the majority of the world neither benefits from capitalism nor from democratic systems . 
Most of the globe experiences the state as repressive , as an organization that is concerned about denial of rights , about denial of justice , rather than provision of it . 
And in terms of experience of capitalism , there are two aspects that the rest of the globe experiences . 
First , extractive industry . 
Blood diamonds , smuggled emeralds , timber , that is cut right from under the poorest . 
Second is technical assistance . 
And technical assistance might shock you , but it 's the worst form of -- today -- of the ugly face of the developed world to the developing countries . 
Tens of billions of dollars are supposedly spent on building capacity with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day , who are incapable of thinking creatively , or organically . 
Next assumption -- and of course the events of July 7 , I express my deep sympathy , and before that , September 11 -- have reminded us we do not live in three different worlds . 
We live in one world . 
But that 's easily said . 
But we are not dealing with the implications of the one world that we are living in . 
And that is that if we want to have one world , this one world can not be based on huge pockets of exclusion , and then inclusion for some . 
We must now finally come to think about the premises of a truly global world , in relationship to the regime of rights and responsibilities and accountabilities that are truly global in scope . 
Otherwise we will be missing this open moment in history , where we have a consensus on both the form of politics and the form of economics . 
What is one of these organizations to pick ? 
We have three critical terms : economy , civil society and the state . 
I will not deal with those first two , except to say that uncritical transfer of assumptions , from one context to another , can only make for disaster . 
Economics taught in most of the elite universities are practically useless in my context . 
My country is dominated by drug economy and a mafia . 
Textbook economics does not work in my context , and I have very few recommendations from anybody as to how to put together a legal economy . 
The poverty of our knowledge must become the first basis of moving forward , and not imposition of the framework that works on the basis of mathematical modeling , for which I have enormous respect . 
My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best . 
Second , instead of debating endlessly about what is the structure of the state , why do n't we simplify and say , what are a series of functions that the state in the 21st century must perform ? 
Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this ; we hope to share that much widely with -- and third is that we could actually construct an index to measure comparatively how well these functions that we would agree on are being performed in different places . 
So what are these functions ? 
We propose 10 . 
And it 's legitimate monopoly of means of violence , administrative control , management of public finances , investment in human capital , provision of citizenship rights , provision of infrastructure , management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state through regulation , creation of the market , international agreements , including public borrowing , and then , most importantly , rule of law . 
I wo n't elaborate . 
I hope the questions will give me an opportunity . 
This is a feasible goal , basically because , contrary to widespread assumption , I would argue that we know how to do this . 
Who would have imagined that Germany would be either united or democratic today , if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943 ? 
But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany and engaged in planning . 
And there are lots of other examples . 
Now in order to do this -- and this brings this group -- we have to rethink the notion of capital . 
The least important form of capital , in this project , is financial capital -- money . 
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries . 
It 's just cash . 
Because it lacks the institutional , organizational , managerial forms to turn it into capital . 
And what is required is a combination of physical capital , institutional capital , human capital -- and security , of course , is critical , but so is information . 
Now , the issue that should concern us here -- and that 's the challenge that I would like to pose to this group -- is again , it takes 16 years in your countries to produce somebody with a B.S. degree . 
It takes 20 years to produce somebody with a Ph.D. 
The first challenge is to rethink , fundamentally , the issue of the time . 
Do we need to repeat the modalities that we have inherited ? 
Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century . 
What is it that we need to do fundamentally to re - engage in a project , that capital formation is rapid ? 
The absolute majority of the world 's population are below 20 , and they are growing larger and faster . 
They need different ways of being approached , different ways of being enfranchised , different ways of being skilled . 
And that 's the first thing . 
Second is , you 're problem solvers , but you 're not engaging your global responsibility . 
You 've stayed away from the problems of corruption . 
You only want clean environments in which to function . 
But if you do n't think through the problems of corruption , who will ? 
You stay away from design for development . 
You 're great designers , but your designs are selfish . 
It 's for your own immediate use . 
The world in which I operate operates with designs regarding roads , or dams , or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in 60 years . 
This is not right . It requires thinking . 
But , particularly , what we need more than anything else from this group is your imagination to be brought to bear on problems the way a meme is supposed to work . 
As the work on paradigms , long time ago showed -- Thomas Kuhn 's work -- it 's in the intersection of ideas that new developments -- true breakthroughs -- occur . 
And I hope that this group would be able to deal with the issue of state and development and the empowerment of the majority of the world 's poor , through this means . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : So , Ashraf , until recently , you were the finance minister of Afghanistan , a country right at the middle of much of the world 's agenda . 
Is the country gon na make it ? 
Will democracy flourish ? What scares you most ? 
Ashraf Ghani : What scares me most is -- is you , lack of your engagement . 
You asked me . You know I always give the unconventional answer . 
No . But seriously , the issue of Afghanistan first has to be seen as , at least , a 10- to 20-year perspective . 
Today the world of globalization is on speed . 
Time has been compressed . 
And space does not exist for most people . 
But in my world -- you know , when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years , space had expanded . 
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down . 
I rode -- traveled -- travel between two cities that used to take three hours now took 12 . 
So the first is when the scale is that , we need to recognize that just the simple things that are infrastructure -- it takes six years to deliver infrastructure . 
In our world . 
Any meaningful sort of thing . 
But the modality of attention , or what is happening today , what 's happening tomorrow . 
Second is , when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense , brutal forms of exercise of power -- we had the Red Army for 10 continuous years , 110,000 strong , literally terrorizing . 
The sky : every Afghan sees the sky as a source of fear . 
We were bombed practically out of existence . 
Then , tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism -- from all sides . 
The United States , Great Britain , joined for instance , Egyptian intelligence service to train thousands of people in resistance and urban terrorism . 
How to turn a bicycle into an instrument of terror . 
How to turn a donkey , a carthorse , anything . 
And the Russians , equally . 
So , when violence erupts in a country like Afghanistan , it 's because of that legacy . 
But we have to understand that we 've been incredibly lucky . 
I mean , I really ca n't believe how lucky I am here , standing in front of you , speaking . 
When I joined as finance minister , I thought that the chances of my living more than three years would not be more than five percent . 
Those were the risks . They were worth it . 
I think we can make it , and the reason we can make it is because of the people . 
You see , because , I mean -- I give you one statistic . 
91 percent of the men in Afghanistan , 86 percent of the women , listen to at least three radio stations a day . 
In terms of their discourse , in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world , I think that I would dare say , they 're much more sophisticated than rural Americans with college degrees and the bulk of Europeans -- because the world matters to them . 
And what is their predominant concern ? 
Abandonment . 
Afghans have become deeply internationalist . 
You know , when I went back in December of 2001 , I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government because I 'd lived as a nationalist . 
And I told them -- my people , with the Americans here -- separate . 
Yes , I have an advisory position with the U.N. 
I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly . 
And everybody was telling me it was a different world . 
You know , they engage . 
They see engagement , global engagement , as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people . 
And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is -- Clare Lockhart is here , so I 'll recite a discussion she had with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan . 
And that woman said she did n't care whether she had food on her table . 
What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future , where her children could really have a different life . 
That gives me hope . 
CA : How is Afghanistan going to provide alternative income to the many people who are making their living off the drugs trade ? 
AG : Certainly . Well , the first is , instead of sending a billion dollars on drug eradication and paying it to a couple of security companies , they should give this hundred billion dollars to 50 of the most critically innovative companies in the world to ask them to create one million jobs . 
The key to the drug eradication is jobs . 
Look , there 's a very little known fact : countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars do n't produce drugs . 
Second , textile . 
Trade is the key , not aid . 
The U.S. and Europe should give us a zero percent tariff . 
The textile industry is incredibly mobile . 
If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment , we could probably attract four to six billion dollars quite easily in the textile sector , if there was zero tariffs -- would create the type of job . 
Cotton does not compete with opium ; a t - shirt does . 
And we need to understand , it 's the value chain . 
Look , the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired of hearing about microcredit . 
It is important , but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro - production want is global access . 
They do n't want to sell to the charity bazaars that are only for foreigners -- and the same bloody shirt embroidered time and again . 
What we want is a partnership with the Italian design firms . 
Yeah , we have the best embroiderers in the world ! 
Why ca n't we do what was done with northern Italy ? 
With the Put Out system ? 
So I think economically , the critical issue really is to now think through . 
And what I will say here is that aid does n't work . 
You know , the aid system is broken . 
The aid system does not have the knowledge , the vision , the ability . 
I 'm all for it ; after all , I raised a lot of it . 
Yeah , to be exact , you know , I managed to persuade the world that they had to give my country 27.5 billion . 
They did n't want to give us the money . 
CA : And it still did n't work ? 
AG : No . It 's not that it did n't work . 
It 's that a dollar of private investment , in my judgment , is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid , in terms of the dynamic that it generates . 
Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents ; it could be 20 cents ; or it could be four dollars . 
It depends on what form it comes , what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it . 
You know , the aid system , at first , was designed to benefit entrepreneurs of the developed countries , not to generate growth in the poor countries . 
And this is , again , one of those assumptions -- the way car seats are an assumption that we 've inherited in governments , and doors . 
You would think that the US government would not think that American firms needed subsidizing to function in developing countries , provide advice , but they do . 
There 's an entire weight of history vis - a - vis aid that now needs to be reexamined . 
If the goal is to build states that can credibly take care of themselves -- and I 'm putting that proposition equally ; you know I 'm very harsh on my counterparts -- aid must end in each country in a definable period . 
And every year there must be progress on mobilization of domestic revenue and generation of the economy . 
Unless that kind of compact is entered into , you will not be able to sustain the consensus .

Larry Brilliant makes the case for optimism 
I 'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it , the problems and the opportunities that we face , and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic . 
And then I 'll let you in on a secret , which is why I am an incurable optimist . 
Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before . 
Now , you 've all seen " Inconvenient Truth . " This is a little more inconvenient . 
: Man : ... extremely dangerous questions . 
Because , with our present knowledge , we have no idea what would happen . 
Even now , man may be unwittingly changing the world 's climate through the waste products of his civilization . 
Due to our release , through factories and automobiles every year , of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide -- which helps air absorb heat from the sun -- our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer . 
This is bad ? 
Well , it 's been calculated a few degrees ' rise in the earth 's temperature would melt the polar ice caps . 
And if this happens , an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley . 
Tourists in glass - bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through 150 feet of tropical water . 
For , in weather , we 're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety than even the atomic physicist encounters , but with life itself . 
Larry Brilliant : Should we feel good , or should we feel bad that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little ? 
Well , it depends , really , on what your goals are . 
And I think , as my goals , I always go back to Gandhi 's talisman . 
When Mahatma Gandhi was asked , " How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one or the wrong one ? " he said , " Consider the face of the poorest , most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon , and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person . 
And if it will be , it 's the right thing to do , and if not , rethink it . " 
For those of us in this room , it 's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual , it 's the community , it 's the culture , it 's the world itself . 
And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society , who are the poorest and the most vulnerable , the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism . 
But there 's also a wonderful case for optimism . 
Let 's review them both . First of all , the megatrends . 
There 's two degrees , or three degrees of climate change baked into the system . 
It will cause rising seas . It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands . 
It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable , as will the increasing rise of population . 
Even though we 've dodged Paul Ehrlich 's population bomb , and we will not see 20 billion people in this decade , as he had forecast , we eat as if we were 20 billion . 
And we consume so much that again , a rise of 6.5 billion to 9.5 billion in our grandchildren 's lifetime will disproportionately hurt the poorest and the most vulnerable . 
That 's why they migrate to cities . 
That 's why in June of this year , we passed , as a species , 51 percent of us living in cities , and bustees , and slums , and shantytowns . 
The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did . 
The green revolution never reached Africa . 
And with desertification , sandstorms , the Gobi Desert , the Ogaden , we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare to produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago . 
So humans are turning more towards animal consumption . 
In Africa last year , Africans ate 600 million wild animals , and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat . 
And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses that have never been charted , the genomic sequences of which we do n't know . 
Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of , but we are ripe for zoonotic - borne , emerging communicable diseases . 
Increasingly , I would say explosive growth of technology . 
Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth . But it has a dark side -- in bioweapons , and in technology that puts us on a collision course to magnify any anger , hatred or feeling of marginalization . 
And in fact , with increasing globalization -- for which there are big winners and even bigger losers -- today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history . 
One percent of us own 40 percent of all the goods and services . 
What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day rise to three billion in the next 30 years ? 
The one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world 's goods and services . Not because they 've grown richer , but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer . 
Last week , Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said , " This situation is unprecedented , unequal , unfair and unstable . " 
So there 's lots of reason for pessimism . 
Darfur is , at its origin , a resource war . 
Last year , there were 85,000 riots in China , 230 a day , that required police or military intervention . 
Most of them were about resources . 
We are facing an unprecedented number , scale of disasters . 
Some are weather - related , human - rights related , epidemics . 
And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu a quaint forerunner of things to come . It 's a destabilized world . 
And unlike destabilized world in the past , it will be broadcast to you on YouTube , you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones . 
What will that lead to ? 
For some , it will lead to anger , religious and sectarian violence and terrorism . 
For others , withdrawal , nihilism , materialism . 
For us , where does it take us , as social activists and entrepreneurs ? 
As we look at these trends , do we become despondent , or will we become energized ? 
Let 's look at one case , the case of Bangladesh . 
First , even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today , global warming would continue . 
And even with global warming -- if you can see these blue lines , the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today , the next decades will see rising sea levels . 
A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case that we can hope for , and it could be 10 times that . 
What will that do to Bangladesh ? Let 's take a look . 
So here 's Bangladesh . 
70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level . 
Let 's go up and take a look at the Himalayas . 
And we 'll watch as global warming makes them melt . More water comes down , the deforested areas , here in the Tarai , will be unable to absorb the effluent , because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water . 
Now we 're looking down south , through the Kali Gandaki . 
Many of you , I think , have probably trekked here . 
And we 're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water coming from the north , and in the seas rising from the south . 
Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh . 
And now let 's look from the south , looking up , and let 's see this in relief . 
A minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas , coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas . And take a look at this . 
As many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate into India and into China . 
This is the difficulty that one country faces . 
But if you look at the globe , all around the earth , wherever there is low - lying area , populated areas near the water , you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life . 
Sub - Saharan Africa , and even our own San Francisco Bay Area . 
We 're all in this together . 
This is not something that happens far away to people that we do n't know . 
Global warming is something that happens to all of us , all at once . 
As are these newly emerging communicable diseases , names that you had n't heard 20 years ago : ebola , lhasa fever , monkey pox . 
With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans , we live in each other 's viral environment . 
Do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of West Nile fever ? 
And then we watched , as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States and it marched every year , westwardly . 
Do you remember no one had heard of ebola until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it ? 
It 's just the beginning , unfortunately . 
There have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years . 
It 's more than enough reason for pessimism . 
But now let 's look at the case for optimism . 
Enough of the bad news . Human beings have always risen to the challenge . 
You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves . 
We 've been here before , paralyzed by fear , paralyzed into inaction , when some -- probably one of you in this room -- jumped into the breach and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility , which fought against the nuclear threat , Medicins Sans Frontieres , that renewed our commitment to disaster relief , Mohamed ElBaradei , and the tremendous hope and optimism that he brought all of us , and our own Muhammad Yunus . 
We 've seen the eradication of smallpox . 
We may see the eradication of polio this year . 
Last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world . 
We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year -- there are only 35,000 cases left in the world . 
20 years ago , there were three and a half million . 
And we 've seen a new disease , not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases . 
This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome . 
It 's an amazing phenomenon . 
All throughout the technology world , we 're seeing young people bitten by this disease of sudden wealth syndrome . 
But they 're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did . 
They 're not waiting until they die to create foundations . 
They 're actively guiding their money , their resources , their hearts , their commitments , to make the world a better place . 
Certainly , nothing can give you more optimism than that . 
More reasons to be optimistic : in the ' 60s , and I am a creature of the ' 60s , there was a movement . 
We all felt that we were part of it , that a better world was right around the corner , that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice . 
Today , there 's another kind of movement . It 's a movement to save the earth . 
It 's just beginning . 
Five weeks ago , a group of activists from the business community gathered together to stop a Texas utility from building nine coal - fired electrical plants that would have contributed to destroying the environment . 
Six months ago , a group of business activists gathered together to join with the Republican governor in California to pass AB 32 , the most far - reaching legislation in environmental history . 
Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness . 
Can you imagine ? 
We 're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago I would not have believed , as the evangelical community has understood the desperate situation of global warming . 
And now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement . 
It is something to be greatly optimistic about . 
The European 20 - 20 - 20 plan is an amazing breakthrough , something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon . 
And on April 14th , there will be Step Up Day , where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest against legislation -- pushing for legislation to stop global warming . 
And on July 7th , around the world , I learned only yesterday , there will be global Live Earth concerts . 
And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air . 
Now , that does n't mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most . 
That means that people are beginning the first step , which is acting out of their own self - interest . 
But I am seeing in the major funders , in CARE , Rockefeller , Rockefeller Brothers Fund , Hewlett , Mercy Corps , you guys , Google , so many other organizations , a beginning of understanding that we need to work not just on primary prevention of global warming , but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming on the poorest and the most vulnerable . 
But for me , I have another reason to be an incurable optimist . 
And you 've heard so many inspiring stories here , and I heard so many last night that I thought I would share a little bit of mine . 
My background is not exactly conventional medical training . 
And I lived in a Himalayan monastery , and I studied with a very wise teacher , who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny -- it felt like Yoda -- it is your destiny to go to work for WHO and to help eradicate smallpox , at a time when there was no smallpox program . 
It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists because it was the worst disease in history . 
In the last century -- that 's the one that was seven years ago -- half a billion people died from smallpox : more than all the wars in history , more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world . 
In the Summer of Love , in 1967 , two million people , children , died of smallpox . 
It 's not ancient history . 
When you read the biblical plague of boils , that was smallpox . 
Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth , whose picture is here , died of smallpox . 
To eradicate smallpox , we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history . 
We visited every house in India , searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses , once every month , for nearly two years . 
In a cruel reversal , after we had almost conquered smallpox -- and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur , the realm of the final inch . 
When we had almost eradicated smallpox , it came back again , because the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers , who could come there and get employment . 
And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox , and they went home to die . 
And when they did , they took smallpox to 10 other countries and reignited the epidemic . 
And we had to start all over again . 
But , in the end , we succeeded , and the last case of smallpox : this little girl , Rahima Banu -- Barisal , in Bangladesh -- when she coughed or breathed , and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus , thus ended a chain of transmission of history 's greatest horror . 
How can that not make you optimistic ? 
A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India , and blinded half of all of those who were made blind in India , ended . 
And most importantly for us here in this room , a bond was created . 
Doctors , health workers , from 30 different countries , of every race , every religion , every color , worked together , fought alongside each other , fought against a common enemy , did n't fight against each other . 
How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future ? 
Thank you very much .

At TED2010 , mathematics legend Benoit Mandelbrot develops a theme he first discussed at TED in 1984 -- the extreme complexity of roughness , and the way that fractal math can find order within patterns that seem unknowably complicated .

Benoit Mandelbrot : Fractals and the art of roughness 
Thank you very much . 
Please excuse me for sitting ; I 'm very old . 
Well , the topic I 'm going to discuss is one which is , in a certain sense , very peculiar because it 's very old . 
Roughness is part of human life forever and forever , and ancient authors have written about it . 
It was very much uncontrollable , and in a certain sense , it seemed to be the extreme of complexity , just a mess , a mess and a mess . 
There are many different kinds of mess . 
Now , in fact , by a complete fluke , I got involved many years ago in a study of this form of complexity , and to my utter amazement , I found traces -- very strong traces , I must say -- of order in that roughness . 
And so today , I would like to present to you a few examples of what this represents . 
I prefer the word roughness to the word irregularity because irregularity -- to someone who had Latin in my long - past youth -- means the contrary of regularity . 
But it is not so . 
Regularity is the contrary of roughness because the basic aspect of the world is very rough . 
So let me show you a few objects . 
Some of them are artificial . 
Others of them are very real , in a certain sense . 
Now this is the real . It 's a cauliflower . 
Now why do I show a cauliflower , a very ordinary and ancient vegetable ? 
Because old and ancient as it may be , it 's very complicated and it 's very simple , both at the same time . 
If you try to weigh it -- of course it 's very easy to weigh it , and when you eat it , the weight matters -- but suppose you try to measure its surface . 
Well , it 's very interesting . 
If you cut , with a sharp knife , one of the florets of a cauliflower and look at it separately , you think of a whole cauliflower , but smaller . 
And then you cut again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , and you still get small cauliflowers . 
So the experience of humanity has always been that there are some shapes which have this peculiar property , that each part is like the whole , but smaller . 
Now , what did humanity do with that ? 
Very , very little . 
So what I did actually is to study this problem , and I found something quite surprising . 
That one can measure roughness by a number , a number , 2.3 , 1.2 and sometimes much more . 
One day , a friend of mine , to bug me , brought a picture and said , " What is the roughness of this curve ? " 
I said , " Well , just short of 1.5 . " 
It was 1.48 . 
Now , it did n't take me any time . 
I 've been looking at these things for so long . 
So these numbers are the numbers which denote the roughness of these surfaces . 
I hasten to say that these surfaces are completely artificial . 
They were done on a computer , and the only input is a number , and that number is roughness . 
So on the left , I took the roughness copied from many landscapes . 
To the right , I took a higher roughness . 
So the eye , after a while , can distinguish these two very well . 
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness . 
This is very rough , and this is sort of smooth , and this perfectly smooth . 
Very few things are very smooth . 
So then if you try to ask questions : " What 's the surface of a cauliflower ? " 
Well , you measure and measure and measure . 
Each time you 're closer , it gets bigger , down to very , very small distances . 
What 's the length of the coastline of these lakes ? 
The closer you measure , the longer it is . 
The concept of length of coastline , which seems to be so natural because it 's given in many cases , is , in fact , complete fallacy ; there 's no such thing . 
You must do it differently . 
What good is that , to know these things ? 
Well , surprisingly enough , it 's good in many ways . 
To begin with , artificial landscapes , which I invented sort of , are used in cinema all the time . 
We see mountains in the distance . 
They may be mountains , but they may be just formulae , just cranked on . 
Now it 's very easy to do . 
It used to be very time - consuming , but now it 's nothing . 
Now look at that . That 's a real lung . 
Now a lung is something very strange . 
If you take this thing , you know very well it weighs very little . 
The volume of a lung is very small , but what about the area of the lung ? 
Anatomists were arguing very much about that . 
Some say that a normal male 's lung has an area of the inside of a basketball [ court ] . 
And the others say , no , five basketball [ courts ] . 
Enormous disagreements . 
Why so ? Because , in fact , the area of the lung is something very ill - defined . 
The bronchi branch , branch , branch and they stop branching , not because of any matter of principle , but because of physical considerations : the mucus , which is in the lung . 
So what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung , but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale , for a man and for a little rodent . 
Now , what good is it to have that ? 
Well , surprisingly enough , amazingly enough , the anatomists had a very poor idea of the structure of the lung until very recently . 
And I think that my mathematics , surprisingly enough , has been of great help to the surgeons studying lung illnesses and also kidney illnesses , all these branching systems , for which there was no geometry . 
So I found myself , in other words , constructing a geometry , a geometry of things which had no geometry . 
And a surprising aspect of it is that very often , the rules of this geometry are extremely short . 
You have formulas that long . 
And you crank it several times . 
Sometimes repeatedly : again , again , again , the same repetition . 
And at the end , you get things like that . 
This cloud is completely , 100 percent artificial . 
Well , 99.9 . 
And the only part which is natural is a number , the roughness of the cloud , which is taken from nature . 
Something so complicated like a cloud , so unstable , so varying , should have a simple rule behind it . 
Now this simple rule is not an explanation of clouds . 
The seer of clouds had to take account of it . 
I do n't know how much advanced these pictures are . They 're old . 
I was very much involved in it , but then turned my attention to other phenomena . 
Now , here is another thing which is rather interesting . 
One of the shattering events in the history of mathematics , which is not appreciated by many people , occurred about 130 years ago , 145 years ago . 
Mathematicians began to create shapes that did n't exist . 
Mathematicians got into self - praise to an extent which was absolutely amazing , that man can invent things that nature did not know . 
In particular , it could invent things like a curve which fills the plane . 
A curve 's a curve , a plane 's a plane , and the two wo n't mix . 
Well , they do mix . 
A man named Peano did define such curves , and it became an object of extraordinary interest . 
It was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man 's mind . 
Well , I was very sorry to point out that the pure man 's mind has , in fact , seen at long last what had been seen for a long time . 
And so here I introduce something , the set of rivers of a plane - filling curve . 
And well , it 's a story unto itself . 
So it was in 1875 to 1925 , an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world . 
And the objects which were used as examples , when I was a child and a student , as examples of the break between mathematics and visible reality -- those objects , I turned them completely around . 
I used them for describing some of the aspects of the complexity of nature . 
Well , a man named Hausdorff in 1919 introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke , and I found that this number was a good measurement of roughness . 
When I first told it to my friends in mathematics they said , " Do n't be silly . It 's just something [ silly ] . " 
Well actually , I was not silly . 
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well . 
The things on the ground are algae . 
He did not know the mathematics ; it did n't yet exist . 
And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West . 
But painting for a long time had a fractal side . 
I could speak of that for a long time . 
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect . 
I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower , and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood . 
This is a mess , mess , mess , Brownian loop . 
One day I decided -- halfway through my career , I was held by so many things in my work -- I decided to test myself . 
Could I just look at something which everybody had been looking at for a long time and find something dramatically new ? 
Well , so I looked at these things called Brownian motion -- just goes around . 
I played with it for a while , and I made it return to the origin . 
Then I was telling my assistant , " I do n't see anything . Can you paint it ? " 
So he painted it , which means he put inside everything . He said : " Well , this thing came out ... " And I said , " Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! 
I see ; it 's an island . " 
And amazing . 
So Brownian motion , which happens to have a roughness number of two , goes around . 
I measured it , 1.33 . 
Again , again , again . 
Long measurements , big Brownian motions , 1.33 . 
Mathematical problem : how to prove it ? 
It took my friends 20 years . 
Three of them were having incomplete proofs . 
They got together , and together they had the proof . 
So they got the big [ Fields ] medal in mathematics , one of the three medals that people have received for proving things which I 've seen without being able to prove them . 
Now everybody asks me at one point or another , " How did it all start ? 
What got you in that strange business ? " 
What got you to be , at the same time , a mechanical engineer , a geographer and a mathematician and so on , a physicist ? 
Well actually I started , oddly enough , studying stock market prices . 
And so here I had this theory , and I wrote books about it -- financial prices increments . 
To the left you see data over a long period . 
To the right , on top , you see a theory which is very , very fashionable . 
It was very easy , and you can write many books very fast about it . 
There are thousands of books on that . 
Now compare that with real price increments . 
Where are real price increments ? 
Well , these other lines include some real price increments and some forgery which I did . 
So the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price variation . 
And it went really well 50 years ago . 
For 50 years , people were sort of pooh - poohing me because they could do it much , much easier . 
But I tell you , at this point , people listened to me . 
These two curves are averages : Standard & Poor , the blue one ; and the red one is Standard & Poor 's from which the five biggest discontinuities are taken out . 
Now discontinuities are a nuisance , so in many studies of prices , one puts them aside . 
" Well , acts of God . 
And you have the little nonsense which is left . 
Acts of God . " In this picture , five acts of God are as important as everything else . 
In other words , it is not acts of God that we should put aside . 
That is the meat , the problem . 
If you master these , you master price , and if you do n't master these , you can master the little noise as well as you can , but it 's not important . 
Well , here are the curves for it . 
Now , I get to the final thing , which is the set of which my name is attached . 
In a way , it 's the story of my life . 
My adolescence was spent during the German occupation of France . 
Since I thought that I might vanish within a day or a week , I had very big dreams . 
And after the war , I saw an uncle again . 
My uncle was a very prominent mathematician , and he told me , " Look , there 's a problem which I could not solve 25 years ago , and which nobody can solve . 
This is a construction of a man named [ Gaston ] Julia and [ Pierre ] Fatou . 
If you could find something new , anything , you will get your career made . " 
Very simple . 
So I looked , and like the thousands of people that had tried before , I found nothing . 
But then the computer came , and I decided to apply the computer , not to new problems in mathematics -- like this wiggle wiggle , that 's a new problem -- but to old problems . 
And I went from what 's called real numbers , which are points on a line , to imaginary , complex numbers , which are points on a plane , which is what one should do there , and this shape came out . 
This shape is of an extraordinary complication . 
The equation is hidden there , z goes into z squared , plus c. 
It 's so simple , so dry . 
It 's so uninteresting . 
Now you turn the crank once , twice : twice , marvels come out . 
I mean this comes out . 
I do n't want to explain these things . 
This comes out . This comes out . 
Shapes which are of such complication , such harmony and such beauty . 
This comes out repeatedly , again , again , again . 
And that was one of my major discoveries , to find that these islands were the same as the whole big thing , more or less . 
And then you get these extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place . 
All that from this little formula , which has whatever , five symbols in it . 
And then this one . 
The color was added for two reasons . 
First of all , because these shapes are so complicated that one could n't make any sense of the numbers . 
And if you plot them , you must choose some system . 
And so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different colorings because some colorings emphasize that , and others it is that or that . 
It 's so complicated . 
In 1990 , I was in Cambridge , U.K. 
to receive a prize from the university , and three days later , a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing . 
So where did this come from ? 
Obviously , from extraterrestrials . 
Well , so the newspaper in Cambridge published an article about that " discovery " and received the next day 5,000 letters from people saying , " But that 's simply a Mandelbrot set very big . " 
Well , let me finish . 
This shape here just came out of an exercise in pure mathematics . 
Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules , which are repeated without end . 
Thank you very much .

At TEDxPeachtree , bioethicist Paul Root Wolpe describes an astonishing series of recent bio - engineering experiments , from glowing dogs to mice that grow human ears . He asks : Is n't it time to set some ground rules ?

Paul Root Wolpe : It 's time to question bio - engineering 
Today I want to talk about design , but not design as we usually think about it . 
I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific , biotechnological culture , where , for really the first time in history , we have the power to design bodies , to design animal bodies , to design human bodies . 
In the history of our planet , there have been three great waves of evolution . 
The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution . 
So , as you all know , species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments , and the pressures of those environments selected which changes , through random mutation in species , were going to be preserved . 
Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution , which was we changed the environment in which we evolved . 
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization . 
And that has been the second great -- couple 100,000 years , 150,000 years -- flow of our evolution . 
By changing our environment , we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve . 
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities , all the way through modern medicine , we have changed our own evolution . 
Now we 're entering a third great wave of evolutionary history , which has been called many things : " intentional evolution , " " evolution by design " -- very different than intelligent design -- whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet . 
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species , as well as our cultures , because of this change . 
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time . 
We started selectively breeding animals many , many thousands of years ago . 
And if you think of dogs for example , dogs are now intentionally - designed creatures . 
There is n't a dog on this earth that 's a natural creature . 
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like . 
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them . 
We do n't have to do it that way anymore . 
This is a beefalo . 
A beefalo is a buffalo - cattle hybrid . 
And they are now making them , and someday , perhaps pretty soon , you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket . 
This is a geep , a goat - sheep hybrid . 
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards . 
I think they said it tasted like chicken . 
This is a cama . 
A cama is a camel - llama hybrid , created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama . 
And they are now using these in certain cultures . 
Then there 's the liger . 
This is the largest cat in the world -- the lion - tiger hybrid . 
It 's bigger than a tiger . 
And in the case of the liger , there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild . 
But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology . 
And then finally , everybody 's favorite , the zorse . 
None of this is Photoshopped . These are real creatures . 
And so one of the things we 've been doing is using genetic enhancement , or genetic manipulation , of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics . 
And if that were all this was about , then it would be an interesting thing . 
But something much , much more powerful is happening now . 
These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep - sea jellyfish . 
We all know that some deep - sea creatures glow . 
Well , they 've now taken that gene , that bioluminescent gene , and put it into mammal cells . 
These are normal cells . 
And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light . 
Once they could do that with cells , they could do it with organisms . 
So they did it with mouse pups , kittens . 
And by the way , the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that 's a bioluminescent gene from coral , while this is from jellyfish . 
They did it with pigs . 
They did it with puppies . 
And , in fact , they did it with monkeys . 
And if you can do it with monkeys -- though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes -- if they can do it in monkeys , they can probably figure out how to do it in apes , which means they can do it in human beings . 
In other words , it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark . 
Be easier to find us at night . 
And in fact , right now in many states , you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets . 
These are zebra fish . They 're normally black and silver . 
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow , green , red , and they are actually available now in certain states . 
Other states have banned them . 
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures . 
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA -- that controls genetically - engineered pets . 
And so some states have decided to allow them , some states have decided to ban them . 
Some of you may have read about the FDA 's consideration right now of genetically - engineered salmon . 
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon , using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat , to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed . 
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether , pretty soon , you could be eating this fish -- it 'll be sold in the stores . 
And before you get too worried about it , here in the United States , the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically - modified components to it . 
So even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe -- without any regulation , and even without any identification on the package . 
These are all the first cloned animals of their type . 
So in the lower right here , you have Dolly , the first cloned sheep -- now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh ; Ralph the rat , the first cloned rat ; CC the cat , for cloned cat ; Snuppy , the first cloned dog -- Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy -- created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo , which he had not . 
He actually was the first person to clone a dog , which is a very difficult thing to do , because dog genomes are very plastic . 
This is Prometea , the first cloned horse . 
It 's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy , a real " gold ring " of cloning , because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings . 
In other words , the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed . 
But if you can clone that horse , you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud . 
These were the first cloned calves , the first cloned grey wolves , and then , finally , the first cloned piglets : Alexis , Chista , Carrel , Janie and Dotcom . 
In addition , we 've started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species . 
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create . 
So with antithrombin in that goat -- that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create . 
And then in addition , transgenic pigs , knockout pigs , from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea , are pigs that they are going to use , in fact , to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them , instead of producing them in an industrial way . 
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species . 
The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate . 
A somatic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , gestated in the ovum of a cow , and then that cow gave birth to a guar . 
Same thing happened with the mouflon , where it 's an endangered species of sheep . 
It was gestated in a regular sheep body , which actually raises an interesting biological problem . 
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies . 
We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA , but we also have DNA in our mitochondria , which are the energy packets of the cell . 
That DNA is passed down through our mothers . 
So really , what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon , but a guar with cow mitochondria , and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA , and a mouflon with another species of sheep 's mitochondrial DNA . 
These are really hybrids , not pure animals . 
And it raises the question of how we 're going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we 're not really sure yet how to solve . 
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach . 
And what they 've done here is they 've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top , and it 's on a big computer tracking ball . 
And now , using a joystick , they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right , forwards or backwards . 
They 've created a kind of insect bot , or bugbot . 
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that . 
This actually is one of DARPA 's very important -- DARPA is the Defense Research Agency -- one of their projects . 
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings . 
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs , and they can fly these creatures around the lab . 
They can make them go left , right . They can make them take off . 
They ca n't actually make them land . 
They put them about one inch above the ground , and then they shut everything off and they go pfft . 
But it 's the closest they can get to a landing . 
And in fact , this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage , and that 's when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology , so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth , it is already prewired . 
The wires are already in its body , and they can just hook it up to their technology , and now they 've got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance . 
They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones . 
It 's not just insects . 
This is the ratbot , or the robo - rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate . 
Again , it 's got technology -- it 's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres ; it 's got a camera on top of its head . 
The scientists can make this creature go left , right . 
They have it running through mazes , controlling where it 's going . 
They 've now created an organic robot . 
The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar 's lab said , " Is this ethical ? 
We 've taken away the autonomy of this animal . " 
I 'll get back to that in a minute . 
There 's also been work done with monkeys . 
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke . 
He took owl monkeys , wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved , especially looking at the movement of their right arm . 
The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways . 
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm , which you see here in the picture , put the arm in another room . 
Pretty soon , the computer learned , by reading the monkey 's brainwaves , to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey 's arm did . 
Then he put a video monitor in the monkey 's cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm , and the monkey got fascinated . 
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm , this prosthetic arm would do . 
And eventually she was moving it and moving it , and eventually stopped moving her right arm and , staring at the screen , could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves -- which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms . 
And it 's not just technology that we 're putting into animals . 
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida . 
He took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rats -- put them on a chip . 
They self - aggregated into a network , became an integrated chip . 
And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator . 
So now we have organic computer chips made out of living , self - aggregating neurons . 
Finally , Mussa - Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact , independent lamprey eel brain . 
This is a brain from a lamprey eel . 
It is living -- fully - intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides , attached photosensitive sensors to the brain , put it into a cart -- here 's the cart , the brain is sitting there in the middle -- and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart , when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart , the cart moves toward the light ; when you turn it off , it moves away . 
It 's photophilic . 
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain . 
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts , sitting there in its nutrient medium ? 
I do n't know , but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding . 
So , we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes . 
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts . 
He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin , put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being . 
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation . 
This is where we are in this process . 
Finally , not that long ago , Craig Venter created the first artificial cell , where he took a cell , took a DNA synthesizer , which is a machine , created an artificial genome , put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell . 
In other words , that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -- it did not have an organic parent . 
And so , asks The Economist : " The first artificial organism and its consequences . " 
So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that . 
But in fact , that 's not what Frankenstein 's lab looks like . 
This is what Frankenstein 's lab looks like . 
This is a DNA synthesizer , and here at the bottom are just bottles of A , T , C and G -- the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain . 
And so , we need to ask ourselves some questions . 
For the first time in the history of this planet , we are able to directly design organisms . 
We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power , and it confers on us a responsibility . 
Is everything okay ? 
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want ? 
Do we have free reign to design animals ? 
Do we get to go someday to Pets ' R ' Us and say , " Look , I want a dog . 
I 'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund , the body of a retriever , maybe some pink fur , and let 's make it glow in the dark " ? 
Does industry get to create creatures who , in their milk , in their blood , and in their saliva and other bodily fluids , create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines ? 
Do we get to create organic robots , where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings ? 
And then the final step of this , once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings , what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then ? 
It 's already happening . It 's not science fiction . 
We are not only already using these things in animals , some of them we 're already beginning to use on our own bodies . 
We are now taking control of our own evolution . 
We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet . 
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now . 
It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future . 
Thanks . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/nina_jablonski_breaks_the_illusion_of_skin_color.html 
Nina Jablonski says that differing skin colors are simply our bodies ' adaptation to varied climates and levels of UV exposure . Charles Darwin disagreed with this theory , but she explains , that 's because he did not have access to NASA .

Nina Jablonski breaks the illusion of skin color 
Interestingly , Charles Darwin was born a very lightly pigmented man , in a moderately - to - darkly pigmented world . 
Over the course of his life , Darwin had great privilege . 
He lived in a fairly wealthy home . 
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents . 
And when he was in his 20s he embarked upon a remarkable voyage on the ship the Beagle . 
And during the course of that voyage , he saw remarkable things : tremendous diversity of plants and animals , and humans . 
And the observations that he made on that epic journey were to be eventually distilled into his wonderful book , " On the Origin of Species , " published 150 years ago . 
Now what is so interesting and to some , the extent , what 's a bit infamous about " The Origin of Species , " is that there is only one line in it about human evolution . 
" Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history . " 
It was n't until much longer , much later , that Darwin actually spoke and wrote about humans . 
Now in his years of traveling on the Beagle , and from listening to the accounts or explorers and naturalists , he knew that skin color was one of the most important ways in which people varied . 
And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color . 
He knew that darkly pigmented peoples were found close to the equator ; lightly pigmented peoples , like himself , were found closer to the poles . 
So what did he make of all this ? 
Well he did n't write anything about it in The Origin of Species . 
But much later , in 1871 , he did have something to say about it . 
And it was quite curious . He said , " Of all the differences between the races of men , the color of the skin is the most conspicuous and one of the best marked . " 
And he went on to say , " These differences do not coincide with corresponding differences in climate . " 
So he had traveled all around . 
He had seen people of different colors living in different places . 
And yet he rejected the idea that human skin pigmentation was related to the climate . 
If only Darwin lived today . 
If only Darwin had NASA . 
Now , one of the wonderful things that NASA does is it puts up a variety of satellites that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment . 
And for many decades now there have been a series of TOMS satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth 's surface . 
The TOMS 7 satellite data , shown here , show the annual average ultraviolet radiation at the Earth 's surface . 
Now the really hot pink and red areas are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts of UV during the year . 
The incrementally cooler colors -- blues , greens , yellows , and finally grays -- indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation . 
What 's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere is in these cool gray zones . 
This has tremendous implications for our understanding of the evolution of human skin pigmentation . 
And what Darwin could not appreciate , or did n't perhaps want to appreciate at the time , is that there was a fundamental relationship between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and skin pigmentation . 
And that skin pigmentation itself was a product of evolution . 
And so when we look at a map of skin color , and predicted skin color , as we know it today , what we see is a beautiful gradient from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator , and the lightest ones toward the poles . 
What 's very , very important here is that the earliest humans evolved in high - UV environments , in equatorial Africa . 
The earliest members of our lineage , the genus Homo , were darkly pigmented . 
And we all share this incredible heritage of having originally been darkly pigmented , two million to one and half million years ago . 
Now what happened in our history ? 
Let 's first look at the relationship of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth 's surface . 
In those early days of our evolution , looking at the equator , we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation . 
The UVC , the most energetic type , was occluded by the Earth 's atmosphere . 
But UVB and UVA especially , came in unimpeded . 
UVB turns out to be incredibly important . 
It 's very destructive , but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin , vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones , the health of our immune system , and myriad other important functions in our bodies . 
So , living at the equator , we got lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation and the melanin -- this wonderful , complex , ancient polymer compound in our skin -- served as a superb natural sunscreen . 
This polymer is amazing because it 's present in so many different organisms . 
Melanin , in various forms , has probably been on the Earth a billion years , and has been recruited over and over again by evolution , as often happens . 
Why change it if it works ? 
So melanin was recruited , in our lineage , and specifically in our earliest ancestors evolving in Africa , to be a natural sunscreen . 
Where it protected the body against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation , the destruction , or damage to DNA , and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate , which helps to fuel cell production , and reproduction in the body . 
So , it 's wonderful . We evolved this very protective , wonderful covering of melanin . 
But then we moved . 
And humans dispersed -- not once , but twice . 
Major moves , outside of our equatorial homeland , from Africa into other parts of the Old World , and most recently , into the New World . 
When humans dispersed into these latitudes , what did they face ? 
Conditions were significantly colder , but they were also less intense with respect to the ultraviolet regime . 
So if we 're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere , look at what 's happening to the ultraviolet radiation . 
We 're still getting a dose of UVA . 
But all of the UVB , or nearly all of it , is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere . 
In the winter , when you are skiing in the Alps , you may experience ultraviolet radiation . 
But it 's all UVA , and , significantly , that UVA has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin . 
So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments were bereft of the potential to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year . 
This had tremendous consequences for the evolution of human skin pigmentation . 
Because what happened , in order to ensure health and well - being , these lineages of people dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere lost their pigmentation . 
There was natural selection for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin . 
Here we begin to see the evolution of the beautiful sepia rainbow that now characterizes all of humanity . 
Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once , not just twice , but probably three times . 
Not just in modern humans , but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors , the Neanderthals . 
A remarkable , remarkable testament to the power of evolution . 
Humans have been on the move for a long time . 
And just in the last 5,000 years , in increasing rates , over increasing distances . 
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people , voluntary movements , in the last 5,000 years . 
Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions : people from high UV areas going to low UV and vice versa . 
And not all these moves were voluntary . 
Between 1520 and 1867 , 12 million , 500 people were moved from high UV to low UV areas in the transatlantic slave trade . 
Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences . 
But it also had deleterious health consequences to people . 
So what ? We 've been on the move . 
We 're so clever we can overcome all of these seeming biological impediments . 
Well , often we 're unaware of the fact that we 're living in environments in which our skin is inherently poorly adapted . 
Some of us with lightly pigmented skin live in high - UV areas . 
Some of us with darkly pigmented skin live in low - UV areas . 
These have tremendous consequences for our health . 
We have to , if we 're lightly pigmented , be careful about the problems of skin cancer , and destruction of folate in our bodies , by lots of sun . 
Epidemiologists and doctors have been very good about telling us about protecting our skin . 
What they have n't been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas , or working inside all the time . 
Because the problem there is just as severe , but it is more sinister , because vitamin D deficiency , from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation , is a major problem . 
Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people , and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones , to their gradual decay of their immune systems , or loss of immune function , and probably some problems with their mood and health , their mental health . 
So we have , in skin pigmentation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today . 
And the social consequences , as we know , are incredibly profound . 
We live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another , but often brought into proximity initially as a result of very invidious social interactions . 
So how can we overcome this ? 
How can we begin to understand it ? 
Evolution helps us . 
200 years after Darwin 's birthday , we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States . 
How wonderful is that ? 
This man is significant for a whole host of reasons . 
But we need to think about how he compares , in terms of his pigmentation , to other people on Earth . 
He , as one of many urban admixed populations , is very emblematic of a mixed parentage , of a mixed pigmentation . 
And he resembles , very closely , people with moderate levels of pigmentation who live in southern Africa , or Southeast Asia . 
These people have a tremendous potential to tan , to develop more pigment in their skin , as a result of exposure to sun . 
They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency , if they have desk jobs , like that guy . 
So lets all wish for his great health , and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation . 
Now what is wonderful about the evolution of human skin pigmentation , and the phenomenon of pigmentation , is that it is the demonstration , the evidence , of evolution by natural selection , right on your body . 
When people ask you , " What is the evidence for evolution ? " 
You do n't have to think about some exotic examples , or fossils . 
You just have to look at your skin . 
Darwin , I think , would have appreciated this , even though he eschewed the importance of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life . 
I think , were he able to look at the evidence we have today , he would understand it . 
He would appreciate it . 
And most of all , he would teach it . 
You , you can teach it . 
You can touch it . 
You can understand it . 
Take it out of this room . 
Take your skin color , and celebrate it . 
Spread the word . 
You have the evolution of the history of our species , part of it , written in your skin . 
Understand it . Appreciate it . Celebrate it . 
Go out . Is n't it beautiful ? Is n't it wonderful ? 
You are the products of evolution . 
Thank you .

Over the years , research has shown a counterintuitive fact about human nature : That sometimes , having too much choice makes us less happy . This may even be true when it comes to medical treatment . Baba Shiv shares a fascinating study that measures why choice opens the door to doubt , and suggests that ceding control -- especially on life - or - death decisions -- may be the best thing for us . 
business , cancer , choice 
1514 
Baba Shiv : Sometimes it 's good to give up the driver 's seat 
I want to start on a slightly somber note . 
Two thousand and seven , five years ago , my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer , stage IIB . 
Now , looking back , the most harrowing part of that experience was not just the hospital visits -- these were very painful for my wife , understandably so . 
It was not even the initial shock of knowing that she had breast cancer , just 39 years old , absolutely no history of cancer in her family . 
The most horrifying and agonizing part of the whole experience was we were making decisions after decisions after decisions that were being thrust upon us . 
Should it be a mastectomy ? Should it be a lumpectomy ? 
Should it be a more aggressive form of treatment , given that it was stage IIB ? 
With all the side effects ? 
Or should it be a less aggressive form of treatment ? 
And these were being pressed upon us by the doctors . 
Now , you could ask this question , why were the doctors doing this ? 
Now , a simplistic answer would be , the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves legally . 
I think that is too simplistic . 
These are well - meaning doctors , some of them have gone on to become very good friends . 
They probably were simply following the wisdom that has come down the ages , this adage that when you 're making decisions , especially decisions of importance , it 's best to be in charge , it 's best to be in control , it 's best to be in the driver 's seat . 
And we were certainly in the driver 's seat , making all these decisions , and let me tell you , if some of you had been there , it was a most agonizing and harrowing experience . 
Which got me thinking . 
I said , is there any validity to this whole adage that when you 're making decisions , it 's best to take the driver 's seat , be in charge , be in control ? 
Or are there contexts where we 're far better off taking the passenger 's seat and have someone else drive ? 
For example , a trusted financial advisor , could be a trusted doctor , etc . 
And since I study human decision making , I said , I 'm going to run some studies to find some answers . 
And I 'm going to share one of these studies with you today . 
So , imagine that all of you are participants in the study . 
I want to tell you that what you 're going to do in the study is you 're going to drink a cup of tea . 
If you 're wondering why , I 'll tell you why in a few seconds from now . 
You are going to solve a series of puzzles , and I 'm going to show you examples of these puzzles momentarily . 
And the more puzzles you solve , the greater the chances that you 'll win some prizes . 
Now , why do you have to consume the tea ? 
Why ? Because it makes a lot of sense . 
In order to solve these puzzles effectively , if you think about it , your mind needs to be in two states simultaneously . 
Right ? It needs to be alert , for which caffeine is very good . 
Simultaneously , it needs to be calm . 
Not agitated , calm . For which chamomile is very good . 
Now comes the between - subjects design , the AB design , the AB testing . 
So what I 'm going to do is randomly assign you to one of two groups . 
So imagine that there is an imaginary line out here , so everyone here will be group A , everyone out here will be group B. 
Now , for you folks , what I 'm going to do is I 'm going to show you these two teas , and I 'm asking you , I 'll go ahead and ask you , to choose your tea . So you can choose which of the two tea you want . 
You can decide , what is your mental state : Okay , I 'm going to choose the caffeinated tea , I 'm going to choose the chamomile tea . 
So you 're going to be in charge , you 're going to be in control , you 're going to be in the driver 's seat . 
You folks , I 'm going to show you these two teas , but you do n't have a choice . 
I 'm going to give you one of these two teas , and keep in mind , I 'm going to pick one of these two teas at random for you . 
And you know that . 
So if you think about it , this is an extreme case scenario , because in the real world , whenever you are taking passenger 's seat , very often the driver is going to be someone you trust , an expert , etc . So this is an extreme case scenario . 
Now , you 're all going to consume the tea . 
So imagine that you are taking the tea now , we 'll wait for you to finish the tea . 
We 'll give another five minutes for the ingredient to have its effects . 
Now you 're going to have 30 minutes to solve 15 puzzles . 
Here 's an example of the puzzle you 're going to solve . 
Anyone in the audience want to take a stab ? 
Baba Shiv : Whoa ! 
Okay , that 's cool . 
Yeah , so what we do if we had you , who will get the answer , as a participant , we would have calibrated the difficulty level of the puzzles to your expertise . 
Because we want these puzzles to be difficult . 
These are tricky puzzles because your first instinct is to say " tulip , " and then you have to unstick yourself . 
Right ? So these have been calibrated to your level of expertise . 
Because we want this to be difficult , and I 'll tell you why momentarily . 
Now , here 's another example . 
Anyone ? It 's much more difficult . 
BS : Yeah , wow . Okay . 
So , yeah , so this is again difficult . 
You will say " kambar , " then you will have to go , " maker , " and all that , and then you can unstick yourself . 
Okay , so you have 30 minutes now to solve these 15 puzzles . 
Now , the question we 're asking here is in terms of the outcome , in terms of the number of puzzles solved , will you in the driver 's seat end up solving more puzzles , because you are in control , you could decide which tea you will choose , or would you be better off , in terms of the number of puzzles solved ? 
And systemically what we will show , across a series of studies , is that you , the passengers , even though the tea was picked for you at random , will end up solving more puzzles than you , the drivers . 
We also observe another thing , and that is , you folks not only are solving fewer puzzles , you 're also putting less juice into the task . 
Less effort , you 're less persistent , and so on . 
How do you know that ? 
Well we have two objective measures . 
One is , what is the time , on average , you 're taking in attempting to solve these puzzles ? 
You will spend less time compared to you . 
Second , you have 30 minutes to solve these , are you taking the entire 30 minutes , or are you giving up before the 30 minutes elapse ? 
You will be more likely to give up before the 30 minutes elapse compared to you . 
So , you 're putting in less juice , and therefore the outcome : fewer puzzles solved . 
Now , that brings us now to , why does this happen ? 
And under what situations , when would we see this pattern of results where the passenger is going to show better , more favorable outcomes compared to the driver ? 
It all has to do with when you face what I call the INCA . 
It 's an acronym that stands for the nature of the feedback you 're getting after you 've made the decision . 
So , if you think about it , in this particular puzzle task , it could happen in investing in the stock market , very volatile out there , it could be the medical situation -- the feedback here is immediate . 
You know the feedback , whether you 're solving the puzzles or not . 
Right ? Second , it is negative . 
Remember , the deck was stacked against you . 
In terms of the difficulty level of these puzzles . 
And this can happen in the medical domain . 
For example , very early on in the treatment , things are negative , the feedback , before things become positive . 
Right ? It can happen in the stock market . 
Volatile stock market , getting negative feedback that 's also immediate . 
And the feedback in all these cases is concrete . 
It 's not ambiguous ; you know if you 've solved the puzzles or not . 
Now , the added one , apart from this immediacy , negative , this concreteness , now you have a sense of agency . 
You were responsible for your decision . 
So what do you do ? 
You focus on the foregone option . 
You say , you know what ? I should have chosen the other tea . 
That casts your decision in doubt , reduces the confidence you have in the decision , reduces the confidence you have in the performance , the performance in terms of solving the puzzles . 
And therefore less juice into the task , fewer puzzles solved , a less favorable outcome compared to you folks . 
And this can happen in the medical domain , if you think about it . 
Right ? A patient in the driver 's seat , for example . 
Less juice , which means keeping herself or himself less physically fit , physically active to hasten the recovery process , which is what is often advocated . You probably would n't do that . 
And therefore , there are times when you 're facing the INCA , when the feedback is going to be immediate , negative , concrete , and you have the sense of agency , where you 're far better off taking the passenger 's seat and have someone else drive . 
Now , I started off on the somber note . 
I want to finish up on a more upbeat note . 
It has now been five years , slightly more than five years , and the good news , thank God , is that the cancer is still in remission . 
So it all ends well , but one thing I did n't mention was that very early on into her treatment , my wife and I decided that we will take the passenger 's seat . 
And that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that , we could focus on her recovery . 
We let the doctors make all the decisions , take the driver 's seat . 
Thank you .

Eleni Gabre - Madhin on Ethiopian economics 
You know , there 's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains , far from these beautiful mountains , where the people of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different , which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product . 
And why not ? 
After all , happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few , but a fundamental human right for all . 
And what is happiness ? 
Happiness is the freedom of choice . 
The freedom to chose where to live , what to do , what to buy , what to sell , from whom , to whom , when and how . 
Where does choice come from ? 
And who gets to express it , and how do we express it ? 
Well , one way to express choice is through the market . 
Well - functioning markets provide choices , and ultimately , the ability to express one 's pursuit for happiness . 
The great Indian economist , Amartya Sen , was awarded the Nobel prize for demonstrating that famine is not so much about the availability of food supply , but rather the ability to acquire or entitle oneself to that food through the market . 
In 1984 , in what can only be considered one of the greatest crimes of humanity , nearly one million people died of starvation in my country of birth , Ethiopia . 
Not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a surplus of food in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north , people could not access or entitle themselves to that food . 
That was a turning point for my life . 
Most Africans today , by far , are farmers . 
And most of Africa 's farmers are , by and large , small farmers in terms of land that they operate , and very , very small farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal . 
African agriculture today is among , or is , the most under - capitalized in the world . 
Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated , compared to 40 percent in Asia . 
African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare , compared to 144 in Asia . 
Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa . 
There are eight times more tractors in Latin America , and three times more tractors in Asia , than in Africa . 
The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice , and therefore without much freedom . 
His livelihood is predetermined by the conditions of grinding poverty . 
He comes to the market when prices are lowest , with the meager fruits of his hard labor , just after the harvest , because he has no choice . 
She comes back to the market some months later , when prices are highest , in what we call the lean season -- when food is scarce -- because she has to feed her family and has no choice . 
The real question is , how can markets be developed in rural Africa to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship that we know exists ? 
Another notable economist , Theodore Schultz , in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient , but poor . 
Meaning , in fact , that farmers are rational and profit - minded just like everybody else . 
Well , we do n't need , now , any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake at the market and want to make money , just like everyone else . 
And one thing is clear , which is at least now we know that Africa is open for business . 
And that business is agriculture . 
Over two decades ago , the world insisted to Africa that markets must be liberalized , that economies must be structurally adjusted . 
This meant that governments were to remove themselves from the business of buying and selling -- which they did rather inefficiently -- and let the private market do its magic . 
Well , what happened over the last 25 years ? 
Did Africa feed itself ? 
Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors ? 
I think we 're all in this room , probably , because we know that , in fact , Africa is the only region in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up over the next 10 years , where the food import bill is now double what it was 20 years ago , where food production per capita has stagnated , and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased . 
So why did n't agriculture markets perform to expectations ? 
The market reforms prompted by the West -- and I 've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent doing research on agricultural markets , and have interviewed traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent , hundreds of traders -- trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform . 
And it seems to me that the reforms might have thrown the baby out with the bath water . 
Like its agriculture , Africa 's markets are highly under - capitalized and inefficient . 
We know from our work around the continent that transaction costs of reaching the market , and the risks of transacting in rural , agriculture markets , are extremely high . 
In fact , only one third of agricultural output produced in Africa even reaches the market . 
Africa 's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure in terms of roads and telecommunications , but also because of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions , such as market information , grades and standards , and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers . 
Because of this , commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles , in narrow networks of people they know and trust . 
And because of that , as grain changes hands -- and I 've measured that it changes hands four , five times in its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer -- every time it changes hands -- and I 've seen this all over rural Africa -- it also changes sacks . 
And I thought that was incredibly peculiar . 
And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me over and over -- that 's the only way people know what they 're getting in terms of the quantity and the product quality . 
And that actually has huge implications for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals , and situations where there are deficits , for example . 
It also has very high cost implications . 
I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin is simply due to the fact that , because of the absence of grades and standards and market information , sacks have to be constantly changed . 
And this leads to very high handling costs . 
For their part , small farmers , who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa , come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind -- trusting that they 're going to have some sort of demand for their produce , and completely at the mercy of the merchants in the only market , the nearest local market they know -- where they 're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk . 
Speaking of risk , we have seen that price volatility of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world . 
In Africa , small farmers bear the brunt of this risk . 
In fact , in my view , there is no region of the world and no period in history that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk that Africa 's farmers have to bear . 
And in my view , there is simply no place in the world that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk that our farmers in Africa today face . 
In Ethiopia , for example , the variation in maize prices from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually . 
This kind of market risk is mind - boggling , and has direct implications for not only the incentives of farmers to invest in higher productivity technology , such as modern seeds and fertilizers , but also direct implications for food security . 
To give you an example , between 2001 and 2002 , Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest . 
That in turn , because of the weak marketing system , led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country . 
This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields . 
And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002 . 
Not six months later , in July 2002 , Ethiopia announced a major food crisis , to the same proportions as 1984 : 14 million people at risk of starvation . 
What also happened that year is in the areas where there were good rains , and where farmers had previously produced surplus grain , farmers had decided to withdraw from the fertilizer market , not use fertilizer and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent . 
This is a tragic example of arrested development , or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks . 
And this is not just specific to Ethiopia , but happens over and over , all over Africa . 
Well , I 'm not here today to lament about the situation , or wring my hands . 
I am here to tell you that change is in the air . 
Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions , or cookie - cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions . 
Africa has learned , or is learning somewhat slowly , that markets do n't happen by themselves . 
In the 1980s , it was very fashionable to talk about getting prices right . 
There was a very influential book about that , which was mainly about getting governments out of the market . 
We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just price incentives , but also investing in the right infrastructure and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market . 
When conditions are right , we know and see that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa , just like anywhere else . 
Nearly three years ago , I decided to leave my comfortable job as a World Bank senior economist in Washington and come back to my country of birth , Ethiopia , after nearly 30 years abroad . 
I did so for a simple reason . 
After having spent more than a decade understanding , studying , and trying to convince policymakers and donors about what was wrong with Africa 's agricultural markets , I decided it was time to do something about it . 
I currently lead , in Ethiopia , an exciting new initiative to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange , or ECX . 
Now , the commodity exchange itself , that concept , is not new to the world . 
In fact , in 1848 , 82 grain merchants and farmers got together in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves . 
That was , of course , the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade , which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world . 
The Chicago Board of Trade was established then for precisely the same reasons that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange . 
In the American Midwest , farmers used to load grain onto barges and send it upriver to the Chicago market . 
But once it arrived , if no buyer was to be found , or if prices suddenly dropped , farmers would incur tremendous losses . 
And in fact , would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan , rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms . 
Well , the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market , and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done . 
From there , the greatest innovation of all came about in this market , which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain . 
That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances , and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future . 
This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture , and the rise of Chicago to a global market , agricultural market , superpower from where it was , a small regional town . 
Now , over the last century , we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview of Western industrialized countries , and that the reference prices for cotton , coffee , cocoa -- products produced mainly in the south -- are actually a reference price , or a price discovered in these organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries . 
But that is actually changing . 
And we 're seeing a shift -- powered mainly because of information technology -- a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets . 
And over the last decade , you see that the share of Western exchanges -- and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world -- has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade . 
Similarly , there 's been explosive growth in India , for example , where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here over the last three years by 270 percent a year . 
This is powered by low - cost VSAT technology , aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market . 
China 's Dalian Commodity Exchange , three years ago , 2004 , overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become the second largest commodity exchange in the world . 
Now , in Ethiopia , we 're in the process of designing the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange . 
We 're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model or the India model , but creating a system uniquely tailored to Ethiopia 's needs and realities , Ethiopia 's small farmers . 
So , the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia . 
We 're creating a system that serves all market actors , that creates integrity , trust , efficiency , transparency and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described . 
In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia , we 've done something rather unique , which is to take the approach of an integrated perspective , or what we call the ECX Edge . 
The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem in which the market will develop itself . 
And this is because one of the things we 've learned over the last decade of studying market development in Africa is that the piecemeal approach does not work . 
You 've got one donor trying to develop market information , another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards , another ICT , and yet another on warehousing , or warehouse receipts . 
In our approach in Ethiopia , we 've decided to put together the entire ecosystem , or environment , in which trade takes place . 
That means that the exchange will operate a trading system , which will initially start as an open outcry , because we do n't think the country 's ready for full electronic trading . 
But at the same time , we 'll do something which I think no exchange in the world has ever done , which is itself to operate something like an Internet cafe in the rural areas . 
So that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call the remote access terminal centers -- and actually , without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things , simply see the trading that 's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor . 
At the same time , what 's very fundamental to this market is that -- and again , an innovation that we 've designed for our exchange -- is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country , in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done . 
And in turn , we 'll operate an in - house clearing system , to assure that payment is done appropriately , in the right amount and at the right time , so that basically , we create trust and integrity in the system . 
Obviously , we work with exchange actors , and as we 're developing the exchange market itself , we 're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework , the overarching legal framework for making this market work . 
So , in fact , our proclamation is going to parliament next month . 
What 's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country , using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination directly to farmers . 
What this does is transforms , fundamentally , the farmers ' relationship to the market . 
Whereas before the farmer used to think local -- meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market , eight to 10 kilometers away on average , and sell whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was -- now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market . 
And they start to think national , and even global . 
They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions , but also planting decisions , on the basis of information coming from the futures price market . 
And they come to the market knowing what grades their products will achieve in terms of a price premium . 
So all of this will transform farmers . 
It will also transform the way traders do business . 
It will stop them from doing simple , back - to - back , limited arbitrage to really thinking strategically about how to move grain across long distances from [ surplus regions ] to [ deficit areas ] . 
Can Ethiopia do this ? 
It seems very ambitious . 
But it will create new opportunities . 
We believe that this initiative requires great political will , and we 'll have to align the financial sector , as well as the ICT sector , and really even the underlying legal framework . 
We believe that the winds of change are here , and that we can do it . 
ECX is the market for Ethiopia 's new millennium , which starts in about eight months . 
The last parliament of our century opened with our president announcing to the country that this was the most important economic initiative for the country today . 
We believe that the stakes are high , but that the returns will be even greater . 
ECX , moreover , can become a trading platform for a pan - African market in agricultural commodities . 
Ethiopia 's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value . 
And we feel that over the next five years , if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent , just 40 percent , of the domestic market , and add just 25 percent value to that market , the value of the market doubles . 
Ethiopia 's agricultural market is 30 percent higher than South Africa 's grain production , and , in fact , Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa . 
So the potential is there . 
The will is there . 
The commitment is there . 
So we feel that we have a winning value proposition to transform farmers ' choices , to grow our agriculture , and to change Africa . 
So , we are in the business of finding our happiness . 
Thank you very much .

Architecture student Magnus Larsson details his bold plan to transform the harsh Sahara desert using bacteria and a surprising construction material : the sand itself .

Magnus Larsson : Turning dunes into architecture 
It 's a bit funny to be at a conference dedicated to things not seen , and present my proposal to build a 6,000-kilometer - long wall across the entire African continent . 
About the size of the Great Wall of China , this would hardly be an invisible structure . 
And yet it 's made from parts that are invisible , or near - invisible , to the naked eye : bacteria and grains of sand . 
Now , as architects we 're trained to solve problems . 
But I do n't really believe in architectural problems ; I only believe in opportunities . 
Which is why I 'll show you a threat , and an architectural response . 
The threat is desertification . 
My response is a sandstone wall made from bacteria and solidified sand , stretching across the desert . 
Now , sand is a magical material of beautiful contradictions . 
It is simple and complex . 
It is peaceful and violent . 
It is always the same , never the same , endlessly fascinating . 
One billion grains of sand come into existence in the world each second . 
That 's a cyclical process . 
As rocks and mountains die , grains of sand are born . 
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone . 
And as the sandstone weathers , new grains break free . 
Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale , into a sand dune . 
In a way , the static , stone mountain becomes a moving mountain of sand . 
But , moving mountains can be dangerous . Let me try and explain why . 
Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth 's land surfaces . 
Some are already deserts ; others are being seriously degraded by the sand . 
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel . 
The name means " edge of the desert . " 
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification . 
It was here in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s that major droughts brought three million people to become dependent upon emergency food aid , with about up to 250,000 dying . 
This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again . 
And it 's one that gets very little attention . 
In our accelerated media culture , desertification is simply too slow to reach the headlines . 
It 's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina : too few crying children and smashed up houses . 
And yet desertification is a major threat on all continents , affecting some 110 countries and about 70 percent of the world 's agricultural drylands . 
It seriously threatens the livelihoods of millions of people , and especially in Africa and China . 
And it is largely an issue that we 've created for ourselves through unsustainable use of scarce resources . 
So , we get climate change . 
We get droughts , increased desertification , crashing food systems , water scarcity , famine , forced migration , political instability , warfare , crisis . 
That 's a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously . 
But , how far away is it ? 
I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria to try and find out how far away it is . 
The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year . 
That 's the Sahara eating up almost [ two meters ] a day of the arable land , physically pushing people away from their homes . 
Here I am -- I 'm the second person on the left -- with the elders in Gidan - Kara , a tiny village outside of Sokoto . 
They had to move this village in 1987 as a huge dune threatened to swallow it . 
So , they moved the entire village , hut by hut . 
This is where the village used to be . 
It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune , which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location . 
That 's the kind of forced migration that desertification can lead to . 
If you happen to live close to the desert border , you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away , and abandon your home and your life as you know it . 
Now , sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts . 
And still , those extreme environments are very good places if we want to stop the shifting sands . 
Four years ago , 23 African countries came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara . 
A fantastic project , the initial plan called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted right across the African continent , from Mauritania in the west , all the way to Djibouti in the east . 
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving , what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains from avalanching over its crest . 
And a good way of doing that , the most efficient way , is to use some kind of sand catcher . 
Trees or cacti are good for this . 
But , one of the problems with planting trees is that the people in these regions are so poor that they chop them down for firewood . 
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees and hoping that they wo n't get chopped down . 
This sandstone wall that I 'm proposing essentially does three things . 
It adds roughness to the dune 's surface , to the texture of the dune 's surface , binding the grains . 
It provides a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes . 
If people live inside of the green barrier they can help support the trees , protect them from humans , and from some of the forces of nature . 
Inside of the dunes we find shade . 
We can start harvesting condensation , and start greening the desert from within . 
Sand dunes are almost like ready - made buildings in a way . 
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid , and then excavate the sand , and we have our architecture . 
We can either excavate it by hand or we can have the wind excavate it for us . 
So , the wind carries the sand onto the site and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us . 
But , by now , you 're probably asking , how am I planning to solidify a sand dune ? 
How do we glue those grains of sand together ? 
And the answer is , perhaps , that you use these guys , Bacillus pasteurii , a micro - organism that is readily available in wetlands and marshes , and does precisely that . 
It takes a pile of loose sand and it creates sandstone out of it . 
These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process . 
What happens is , you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand , and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains . 
A chemical process produces calcite , which is a kind of natural cement that binds the grains together . 
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours . 
I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong . 
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes . 
Here I am , playing the part of the mad scientist , working with the bugs at UCL in London , trying to solidify them . 
So , how much would this cost ? 
I 'm not an economist , very much not , but I did , quite literally , a back of the envelope calculation -- -- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars . 
And , after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria , which you 'll never have to pay again , one cubic meter of bacterial sand would be about 11 dollars . 
How do we construct something like this ? 
Well , I 'll quickly show you two options . 
The first is to create a kind of balloon structure , fill it with bacteria , then allow the sand to wash over the balloon , pop the balloon , as it were , disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it . 
Then , a few years afterwards , using permacultural strategies , we green that part of the desert . 
The second alternative would be to use injection piles . 
So , we pushed the piles down through the dune , and we create an initial bacterial surface . 
We then pull the piles up through the dune and we 're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up . 
So , we have a way of turning sand into sandstone , and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes . 
But , what should they look like ? 
Well , I was inspired , for my architectural form , by tafoni , which look a little bit like this , this is a model representation of it . 
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto . 
And I realized that if I scaled them up , they would provide me with good spatial qualities , for ventilation , for thermal comfort , and for other things . 
Now , part of the formal control over this structure would be lost to nature , obviously , as the bacteria do their work . 
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually . 
I think there is really something in that articulation that is quite nice . 
We see the result , the traces , if you like , of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert into these habitable environments . 
Some people believe that this would spread uncontrollably , and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way . 
That 's not true at all . 
It 's a natural process . It goes on in nature today , and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them . 
So , there it is -- architectural anti - desertification structures made from the desert itself . 
Sand - stopping devices , made from sand . 
The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land by the end of the century . 
In a period of unprecedented population growth and increased food demands , this could prove disastrous . 
And quite frankly , we 're putting our heads in the sand . 
If nothing else , I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion . 
But , if I had something like a TED wish , it would be to actually get it built , to start building this habitable wall , this very , very long , but very narrow city in the desert , built into the dunescape itself . 
It 's not only something that supports trees , but something that connects people and countries together . 
I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure , and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges . 
Borges said that " nothing is built on stone , everything is built on sand , but we must build as if the sand were stone . " 
Now , there are many details left to explore in this scheme -- political , practical , ethical , financial . 
My design , as it takes you down the rabbit hole , is fraught with many challenges and difficulties in the real world . 
But , it 's a beginning , it 's a vision . 
As Borges would have it , it 's the sand . 
And I think now is really the time to turn it into stone . Thank you .

Using wikis and digital fabrication tools , TED Fellow Marcin Jakubowski is open - sourcing the blueprints for 50 farm machines , allowing anyone to build their own tractor or harvester from scratch . And that 's only the first step in a project to write an instruction set for an entire self - sustaining village .

Marcin Jakubowski : Open - sourced blueprints for civilization 
Hi , my name is Marcin -- farmer , technologist . 
I was born in Poland , now in the U.S. 
I started a group called Open Source Ecology . 
We 've identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -- things from tractors , bread ovens , circuit makers . 
Then we set out to create an open source , DIY , do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost . 
We call this the Global Village Construction Set . 
So let me tell you a story . 
So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy , and I discovered I was useless . 
I had no practical skills . 
The world presented me with options , and I took them . 
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle . 
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming . 
I bought a tractor -- then it broke . 
I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again . 
Then pretty soon , I was broke too . 
I realized that the truly appropriate , low - cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just did n't exist yet . 
I needed tools that were robust , modular , highly efficient and optimized , low - cost , made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime , not designed for obsolescence . 
I found that I would have to build them myself . 
So I did just that . 
And I tested them . 
And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale . 
So then I published the 3D designs , schematics , instructional videos and budgets on a wiki . 
Then contributors from all over the world began showing up , prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits . 
So far , we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines . 
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own . 
We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity . 
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too . 
We 're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people 's lives in such tangible material ways . 
If we can lower the barriers to farming , building , manufacturing , then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential . 
That 's not only in the developing world . 
Our tools are being made for the American farmer , builder , entrepreneur , maker . 
We 've seen lots of excitement from these people , who can now start a construction business , parts manufacturing , organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid . 
Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear , so complete , that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit . 
I 've planted a hundred trees in a day . 
I 've pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days . 
From what I 've seen , this is only the beginning . 
If this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant . 
A greater distribution of the means of production , environmentally sound supply chains , and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity . 
We 're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology . 
Thank you .

In this bracing talk , coral reef ecologist Jeremy Jackson lays out the shocking state of the ocean today : overfished , overheated , polluted , with indicators that things will get much worse . Astonishing photos and stats make the case .

Jeremy Jackson : How we wrecked the ocean 
I 'm an ecologist , mostly a coral reef ecologist . 
I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist overnight . 
And it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years . 
I mean , somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet . 
And that was what I did . 
And I ended up in Jamaica , in the West Indies , where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary , structurally , that I ever saw in my life . 
And this picture here , it 's really interesting , it shows two things : First of all , it 's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far , and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s , you took pictures in black and white . 
The other thing it shows you is that , although there 's this beautiful forest of coral , there are no fish in that picture . 
Those reefs at Discovery Bay , Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world for 20 years . 
We were the best and the brightest . 
People came to study our reefs from Australia , which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs . 
And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work , how they ought to be , was based on these reefs without any fish . 
Then , in 1980 , there was a hurricane , Hurricane Allen . 
I put half the lab up in my house . 
The wind blew very strong . 
The waves were 25 to 50 feet high . 
And the reefs disappeared , and new islands formed , and we thought , " Well , we 're real smart . 
We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past . " 
And we published a paper in Science , the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane . 
And we predicted what would happen , and we got it all wrong . 
And the reason was because of overfishing , and the fact that a last common grazer , a sea urchin , died . 
And within a few months after that sea urchin dying , the seaweed started to grow . 
And that is the same reef ; that 's the same reef 15 years ago ; that 's the same reef today . 
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime . 
And that 's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide . 
Now , that 's my little , depressing story . 
All of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable depressing stories . 
There are tens of thousands of those stories out there , and it 's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well - being , because it just keeps getting worse . 
And the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe , like a hurricane , it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery , but what 's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that . 
And so I 'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things . 
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod . 
It 's difficult to imagine that two , or some historians would say three world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod . 
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe . 
It fed the slaves brought to the Antilles , the song " Jamaica Farewell " -- " Ackee rice salt fish are nice " -- is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern Canada . 
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s : 35,000 people lost their jobs . 
And that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not - so - tasty species , from species that were near to home to species that were all around the world , and what have you . 
It 's a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish . 
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from , but it 's still cheap , and everybody thinks it 's okay . 
It 's hard to communicate this , and one way that I think is really interesting is to talk about sport fish , because people like to go out and catch fish . 
It 's one of those things . 
This picture here shows the trophy fish , the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat , go to a place off of Key West in Florida , drink a lot of beer , throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water , come back with the biggest and the best fish , and the champion trophy fish are put on this board , where people take a picture , and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish . 
Well , that 's what it 's like now , but this is what it was like in the 1950s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock . 
The trophy fish were so big that you could n't put any of those small fish up on it . 
And the average size trophy fish weighed 250 to 300 pounds , goliath grouper , and if you wanted to go out and kill something , you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish . 
And they tasted really good . 
And people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little , tiny fish . 
And that 's everywhere . 
It 's not just the fish , though , that are disappearing . 
Industrial fishing uses big stuff , big machinery . 
We use nets that are 20 miles long . 
We use longlines that have one million or two million hooks . 
And we trawl , which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish . 
Think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest , because it clears it away . 
And the habitat destruction is unbelievable . 
This is a photograph , a typical photograph , of what the continental shelves of the world look like . 
You can see the rows in the bottom , the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn . 
What that was , was a forest of sponges and coral , which is a critical habitat for the development of fish . 
What it is now is mud , and the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud , to parking lot , is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity . 
We 've managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years . 
We tend to think of oil spills and mercury and we hear a lot about plastic these days . 
And all of that stuff is really disgusting , but what 's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems . 
And I 'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution : one is introduced species and the other is what comes from nutrients . 
So this is the infamous Caulerpa taxifolia , the so - called killer algae . 
A book was written about it . 
It 's a bit of an embarrassment . 
It was accidentally released from the aquarium in Monaco , it was bred to be cold tolerant to have in peoples aquaria . 
It 's very pretty , and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean . 
I do n't know how many of you remember the movie " The Little Shop of Horrors , " but this is the plant of " The Little Shop of Horrors . " 
But , instead of devouring the people in the shop , what it 's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom - dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea . 
We do n't know anything that eats it , we 're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done , but , as it stands , it 's the monster from hell , about which nobody knows what to do . 
Now another form of pollution that 's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients . 
The green revolution , all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer , we use too much of it . 
It 's subsidized , which is one of the reasons we used too much of it . 
It runs down the rivers , and it feeds the plankton , the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water . 
But since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton , there 's nothing to eat the plankton and there 's more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is unheard of for plankton . 
And when it dies , it falls to the bottom and then it rots , which means that bacteria break it down . 
And in the process they use up all the oxygen , and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that ca n't swim away . 
So , what we end up with is a microbial zoo dominated by bacteria and jellyfish , as you see on the left in front of you . 
And the only fishery left -- and it is a commercial fishery -- is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right , where there used to be prawns . 
Even in Newfoundland where we used to catch cod , we now have a jellyfish fishery . 
And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms . 
That picture on the left is just staggering to me . 
I have talked about it a million times , but it 's unbelievable . 
In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta , and the lower left of that picture is the Texas - Mexico border . 
You 're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico ; you 're looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish , made by that beautiful little creature on the lower right . 
And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving ashore . 
That 's the same species . 
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows , and little droplets of the water get into the air , the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress . 
And that 's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida . 
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night , and I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what 's going on . 
And I said , " So , imagine you 're in a movie called ' Escape from Malibu ' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota , where it 's clean and safe . 
And the only people who are left there are the people who ca n't afford to move away from the coast , because the coast , instead of being paradise , is harmful to your health . " 
And then this is amazing . 
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France . 
This is from the coast of Brittany , which is being enveloped in this green , algal slime . 
The reason that it attracted so much attention , besides the fact that it 's disgusting , is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die , and a farmer died of it , and you can imagine the scandal that happened . 
And so there 's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all , and the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis . 
And then , of course , there 's climate change , and we all know about climate change . 
I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the Arctic Sea . 
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage . 
Well , the Northwest Passage is already there . 
I think it 's sort of funny ; it 's on the Siberian coast , maybe the Russians will charge tolls . 
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously . 
The military of the Arctic nations is taking it really seriously . 
For all the denial of climate change by government leaders , the CIA and the navies of Norway and the U.S. and Canada , whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view . 
And , of course , Arctic communities are toast . 
The other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching . It 's a beautiful picture , right ? 
All that white coral . 
Except it 's supposed to be brown . 
What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis , and they have these little algal cells that live inside them . 
And the algae give the corals sugar , and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection . 
But when it gets too hot , the algae ca n't make the sugar . 
The corals say , " You cheated . You did n't pay your rent . " 
They kick them out , and then they die . 
Not all of them die ; some of them survive , some more are surviving , but it 's really bad news . 
To try and give you a sense of this , imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America , and you wake up the next morning , and you look around you , and you see that 80 percent of the trees , as far as you can see , have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked . 
And you come home , and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves . 
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later , " Oh , by the way , a quarter of those died . " 
Well , that 's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino , an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe , when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died . 
And then the really scary thing about all of this -- the overfishing , the pollution and the climate change -- is that each thing does n't happen in a vacuum . 
But there are these , what we call , positive feedbacks , the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts . 
And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this , is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again ? 
I mean , because we , at this point , we can protect it . 
But what does that mean ? 
We really do n't know . 
So what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years ? 
Well , there wo n't be any fish except for minnows , and the water will be pretty dirty , and all those kinds of things and full of mercury , etc . , etc . 
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they 'll start to merge , and we can imagine something like the dead - zonification of the global , coastal ocean . 
Then you sure wo n't want to eat fish that were raised in it , because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette . 
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom ; sometimes you do n't . 
That does n't sell . 
The really scary things though are the physical , chemical , oceanographic things that are happening . 
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer , the water is lighter when it 's warmer , it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over . 
We say it becomes more strongly stratified . 
The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries , of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever , those slow down and those fisheries collapse . 
And , at the same time , water from the surface , which is rich in oxygen , does n't make it down and the ocean turns into a desert . 
So the question is : How are we all going to respond to this ? 
And we can do all sorts of things to fix it , but in the final analysis , the thing we really need to fix is ourselves . 
It 's not about the fish ; it 's not about the pollution ; it 's not about the climate change . 
It 's about us and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world that is different from the selfish world we live in today . 
So the question is : Will we respond to this or not ? 
I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that . 
Thank you .

Humorist John Hodgman rambles through a new story about aliens , physics , time , space and the way all of these somehow contribute to a sweet , perfect memory of falling in love . 
entertainment , humor , love , physics , science

John Hodgman : Aliens , love -- where are they ? 
You all know this story . 
In the summer of 1950 , Enrico Fermi , the Italian - American physicist and atomic - pile builder , went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined some colleagues there , and asked them a question : " Where is everybody ? " 
This confused his colleagues , obviously , because they were sitting right there with him . 
And then he had to clarify that he was n't talking about them . 
He was talking about the space aliens . 
You see , this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell , New Mexico . 
And even though that turned out to be nothing , nothing at all -- -- merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths ... 
Still , America had gone saucer - mad , even famous scientists who were eating lunch . 
Fermi 's reasoning , if I may paraphrase badly , is that the universe is so vast that it stands to reason , there should be other intelligent life out there . 
And the universe is so old that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve , we should have some evidence of their existence by now . 
And yet , to the best of our knowledge , we are alone . 
" Where is everybody ? " asked Fermi , and his colleagues had no answer . 
Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic to disprove fairies , Sasquatch , God , the possibility of love -- and thereafter , as you know , Enrico Fermi ate alone . 
Now , I am not a scientist . 
I have never built an atomic pile . 
Although , I might argue that , technically , every pile is atomic . 
However , with respect , I might point out two possibilities that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider . 
One is that the aliens might be very far away . 
Perhaps , I dare say , even on other planets . 
The other possibility -- -- is , perhaps , Enrico Fermi himself was an alien . 
Think about it . 
Is n't it a little convenient that in the midst of the World War , out of nowhere , suddenly an Italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after ? 
And is n't it a little strange that he required no payment for this ? 
That he asked for only one thing -- a gift of two healthy sperm whales ? 
That 's -- that 's not true . 
But it is strange . 
And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien , would n't he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here ? 
For it is given in certain UFO - ology or UFOlogy circles , that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia ; that they have walked among us in disguise , observing us , guiding our evolution from ape to man -- if you believe in that sort of thing -- and , occasionally , kidnapping us in their flying saucers and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids . 
It 's a difficult theory to discount , I think you 'll agree . 
For even in my own life , there are memories I have that are difficult to explain -- happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird , that it is difficult to imagine they were not the result of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life . 
For how else will you explain the amazing and absolutely true close encounters that I had and will describe to you now ? 
Encounter one : Ocean City , New Jersey , 1980 . 
This was the summer when the special edition of " Close Encounters of the Third Kind " was released . 
And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore . 
Within 12 hours , I was horribly sunburned , just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie . 
And so I spent the rest of the vacation largely sitting outside our little rental house at night , the sidewalk still warm from the sun , watching the skies for UFOs . 
What did I see ? Stars , satellites , blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk . 
Occasionally , kids would come and join me and watch , but their necks soon got sore , and they would go off to the boardwalk to play video games and mingle with humans . 
I was pretty good at the video games . I was not very good at the other part , so I stayed alone with the cosmos . 
And that 's when it happened . 
An elderly couple came walking down the street . 
I would say they were in their late seventies , and I would say that they were on a date , because he was wearing a very neat little suit with a yellow tie -- a brown suit . 
And she was wearing a cardigan , because it was now fully night and a chill was coming in off the ocean . 
I remember , for some reason , that they were exactly the same height . 
And then they stopped , and the man turned to me and said , " What are you looking for , flying saucers ? " 
You have to admit , that 's a pretty boss piece of detective work for an old man on a date . 
But what was stranger still -- and even I realized it at the time , as a nine - year - old child -- was that they stopped at all . 
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll with his sweetheart with the precise reason of making fun of a child . 
" Oh , " he said , " little green men . " 
And then his girlfriend joined in , too . 
" There 's no such thing as space men , " she said . 
" There 's no such thing . " 
And then they both laughed . " Ha , ha , ha . " 
I looked around . 
The street was entirely empty . 
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean . 
It was as though time had stopped . 
I did not know why they were teasing me . 
I looked into their strangely angry faces , and I remember wondering , are they wearing rubber masks ? 
And what would be behind those rubber masks , if they were ? 
Giant , almond - shaped , unblinking eyes ? 
Slits for mouths ? 
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun , and then he made laser sounds . 
" Kew , kew , kew -- watch out . " 
And they turned at once and walked away . 
The old man reached out his knobbly claw for the woman 's hand , and found it , and left me alone . 
Now , you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding -- a strange encounter among humans . 
Maybe it was swamp gas , but -- -- I know what I saw . 
Close encounter two : Brookline , Massachusetts , 1984 . 
I went to see the movie " Dune , " and a girl talked to me . Now , on its face -- -- this is impossible on its face , I realize -- but it is absolutely true . 
It was opening night , naturally . 
I went with my friend Tim McGonigal , who sat on my left . 
On my right was the girl in question . 
She had long , curly black hair , a blue jean jacket . 
I remember , she had some sort of injury to her ankle , an Ace bandage , and she had crutches . 
She was very tall , I would say . 
I was starting high school at the time . I would say she was a junior , but I had never seen her before . She did n't go to my school . 
I did n't know her name , and I never will . 
She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother , and they were talking about the novel , " Dune . " 
They were both big fans , mother and daughter -- very unusual . 
They were talking about how their favorite characters were the giant sandworms . 
And then it got stranger . 
That 's when she turned to me and said , " Are you looking forward to seeing the movie ? " 
First of all , I was embarrassed because I had not read the novel " Dune " at that time . 
I was merely a connoisseur of movies featuring desert planets , as I still am . 
But it was also the tone of how she asked the question : apropos of nothing , like she did n't even care about the answer , as though she just wanted to talk to me . 
I did not know what to say . I said , " Yes . " 
I did not even turn my head . 
The movie began . 
I need not remind you that this was David Lynch 's version of " Dune , " in which all of the characters were sexy and deformed at the same time . 
There was a character called the Third - Stage Guild Navigator , which was a kind of giant , floating fetus - creature that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist of psychedelic spice swirling around him , allowing him to bend space and time . 
He could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world . 
He had become , in his isolation , so deformed and so sexy , that he had to talk through a kind of old - timey radio to the outside world , and could never touch them . 
I mean , I liked him a lot better than the sandworms . 
The sandworms were fine , but your favorite character ? 
Please . 
When the movie ended , everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible . 
Except for the girl . 
As I walked out , her pace slowed . 
Perhaps it was the crutches , but it seemed -- -- it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again . 
When I say it out loud , it sounds so ridiculous , but I can only come to the conclusion that it was what , in the alien abductee community , they call a " screen memory " : a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain to cover up some trauma -- say , of being kidnapped and flown off to a sex pyramid . 
And so I sure am glad I did not slow down to talk to her . 
I sure am glad I never saw her again . 
Close encounter three : Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , 1989 . 
In the mid - to - late ' 80s , the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called " Communion , " in which he described his own lifelong experiences being abducted by aliens . 
And he also described the phenomenon known in this community as " lost time , " where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware that he could not remember the previous ten minutes , or the previous ten hours , or the previous ten days . 
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens were taking him and giving him rectal probes . 
This book became , naturally , an enormous best - seller . 
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book , and was his , sort of , police sketch of what the creatures looked like that Whitley Strieber had described to him . 
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie . 
And in 1989 , the way I remember it , I was in Philadelphia visiting my girlfriend , and we decided , apropos of nothing , to go see this movie . 
And the way I remember it , the movie featured these details . 
One : Whitley Strieber was played by Christopher Walken . 
Two : the alien was played by a rubber puppet . 
Three : there was a surprisingly long sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe . 
Four : this was being shown in a regular movie theater in Center City , Philadelphia . 
Five : all of which is to say , they made a movie out of the book , " Communion , " and it starred Christopher Walken . 
Does something seem strange about this to you ? 
Something odd ? Something off ? Something wrong with this picture ? 
Think about it . Yes . The answer is : I had a girlfriend . What ? 
How did this happen ? When did this happen ? 
I remember walking out of the theater and becoming suddenly aware of this fact , as we walked hand in hand , and pondering these very same questions . 
And to this day , I have no answer for you . 
Close encounter four : the Algarve , Portugal , 1991 . 
Some years later , I and this woman -- we 'll call her " Catherine Fletcher " -- -- went traveling through the south of Portugal together . 
We stayed in old , crumbling , walled cities , in tiny little hotels , and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde and watch the sun set and play checkers . 
What ? Did we do this ? Really ? Does anyone do this ? 
We went to some topless beaches . 
Excuse me ? No , not in my life . 
For what it 's worth , we went to Sagres , which was considered , at the time , to be the end of the world . 
And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock , and the lead dog bit me on the ass , requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic and receive an ass shot . 
Make of that what you will . 
Our last day in Portugal , we were in the district capital of Faro , and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach one last time . 
Now , Faro is a bustling little city , and to get to the beach , she explained , you would have to take a bus and then a boat . 
And did I want to come with ? 
But I was exhausted and dog - bitten , and so I said , " No . " 
I remember what she looked like before she left . 
The freckles had grown and multiplied on her face and shoulders , clustering into a kind of a tan . 
A tan , we were both tan -- is this true ? 
Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue , as a result . 
She was smiling . 
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country , not even speaking the language , to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen . 
I loved her , and then she went out into that strange , alien land . 
It took me some time to come to my senses . 
I had my own " lost time " moment , where I woke up and suddenly realized it was very late in the day , almost dinnertime , and she had not come back . 
Nervous , I went down to the street to look for her . 
Now , I did not speak Portuguese . 
I did not know where the beach was . 
I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991 , and the aliens had not given us that technology yet . 
I realized that the day would only have two possible outcomes : either Catherine would come back to the hotel , or she would never come back to the hotel . 
And so I sat down to wait . 
I did not watch the skies , but the very end of the street where the buses and cars and pedestrians and little scooters were moving along . 
And I watched those constellations shift , hoping that they would part and I would see her face . 
It was at that moment , in that very small town of 30,000 or so , that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe and the searching we might do in it . 
And that 's when the Liberians came along . 
Five young men -- all laughing , happy , traveling together , coming back to this hotel where they were staying . 
One of them was named Joseph , and he asked me what was I doing , and I explained . 
And he said , " Do n't worry . " He was sure that Catherine would be safe . 
But he did not seem so very sure , for he sat down to wait with me . 
And for the next two hours , they all waited with me : taking turns , going up to their room , coming back , telling me jokes , distracting me . 
Two hours , they gave me a message . 
We are not alone . 
And then , in the middle of a sentence , at the very birth of twilight , I turned and looked down the street . 
The stars aligned , and she came back . 
She was smiling . She did not understand why I was so worried . 
Neither did the Liberians , although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter as they clapped us on the back , and went back up to their room and left us alone in the street , holding hands . 
An event like this leaves a scar on the memory , much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a " Portuguese doctor . " 
And even now , a decade and a half later , even now that we are married , I look for her still , whenever she is not in the room . 
And even though , I think you 'll agree , it is probable that during the time she was away , she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone , I love her and wait for her still . 
Thank you for your kind attention .

As the world faces recession , climate change , inequity and more , Tim Jackson delivers a piercing challenge to established economic principles , explaining how we might stop feeding the crises and start investing in our future .

Tim Jackson 's economic reality check 
I want to talk to you today about prosperity , about our hopes for a shared and lasting prosperity . 
And not just us , but the two billion people worldwide who are still chronically undernourished . 
And hope actually is at the heart of this . 
In fact , the Latin word for hope is at the heart of the word prosperity . 
" Pro - speras , " " speras , " hope -- in accordance with our hopes and expectations . 
The irony is , though , that we have cashed - out prosperity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth . 
And we 've grown our economies so much that we now stand in a real danger of undermining hope -- running down resources , cutting down rainforests , spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico , changing the climate -- and the only thing that has actually remotely slowed down the relentless rise of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades is recession . 
And recession , of course , is n't exactly a recipe for hope either , as we 're busy finding out . 
So we 're caught in a kind of trap . 
It 's a dilemma , a dilemma of growth . 
We ca n't live with it ; we ca n't live without it . 
Trash the system or crash the planet -- it 's a tough choice ; it is n't much of a choice . 
And our best avenue of escape from this actually is a kind of blind faith in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency and doing things more efficiently . 
Now I have n't got anything against efficiency . 
And I think we are a clever species sometimes . 
But I think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here . 
So I want you to imagine a world , in 2050 , of around nine billion people , all aspiring to Western incomes , Western lifestyles . 
And I want to ask the question -- and we 'll give them that two percent hike in income , in salary each year as well , because we believe in growth . 
And I want to ask the question : how far and how fast would be have to move ? 
How clever would we have to be ? 
How much technology would we need in this world to deliver our carbon targets ? 
And here in my chart -- on the left - hand side is where we are now . 
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment . 
It 's around about 770 grams of carbon . 
In the world I describe to you , we have to be right over here at the right - hand side at six grams of carbon . 
It 's a 130-fold improvement , and that is 10 times further and faster than anything we 've ever achieved in industrial history . 
Maybe we can do it , maybe it 's possible -- who knows ? 
Maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere , which is what we 're going to need to be doing by the end of the century . 
But should n't we just check first that the economic system that we have is remotely capable of delivering this kind of improvement ? 
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics . 
It 's a bit complex , and I apologize for that . 
What I 'll try and do , is I 'll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms . 
So it looks a little bit like this . 
Firms produce goods for households -- that 's us -- and provide us with incomes , and that 's even better , because we can spend those incomes on more goods and services . 
That 's called the circular flow of the economy . 
It looks harmless enough . 
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system , which is the role of investment . 
Now investment constitutes only about a fifth of the national income in most modern economies , but it plays an absolutely vital role . 
And what it does essentially is to stimulate further consumption growth . 
It does this in a couple of ways -- chasing productivity , which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff . 
But I want to concentrate on the role of investment in seeking out novelty , the production and consumption of novelty . 
Joseph Schumpeter called this " the process of creative destruction . " 
It 's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty , continually chasing expanding consumer markets , consumer goods , new consumer goods . 
And this , this is where it gets interesting , because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty . 
We love new stuff -- new material stuff for sure -- but also new ideas , new adventures , new experiences . 
But the materiality matters too , because in every society that anthropologists have looked at , material stuff operates as a kind of language -- a language of goods , a symbolic language that we use to tell each other stories -- stories , for example , about how important we are . 
Status - driven , conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty . 
And here , all of a sudden , we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic -- the economic institutions , and who we are as people , locked together to drive an engine of growth . 
And this engine is not just economic value ; it is pulling material resources relentlessly through the system , driven by our own insatiable appetites , driven in fact by a sense of anxiety . 
Adam Smith , 200 years ago , spoke about our desire for a life without shame . 
A life without shame : in his day , what that meant was a linen shirt , and today , well , you still need the shirt , but you need the hybrid car , the HDTV , two holidays a year in the sun , the netbook and iPad , the list goes on -- an almost inexhaustible supply of goods , driven by this anxiety . 
And even if we do n't want them , we need to buy them , because , if we do n't buy them , the system crashes . 
And to stop it crashing over the last two to three decades , we 've expanded the money supply , expanded credit and debt , so that people can keep buying stuff . 
And of course , that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis . 
But this -- I just want to show you some data here . 
This is what it looks like , essentially , this credit and debt system , just for the U.K. 
This was the last 15 years before the crash , and you can see there , consumer debt rose dramatically . 
It was above the GDP for three years in a row just before the crisis . 
And in the mean time , personal savings absolutely plummeted . 
The savings ratio , net savings , were below zero in the middle of 2008 , just before the crash . 
This is people expanding debt , drawing down their savings , just to stay in the game . 
This is a strange , rather perverse , story , just to put it in very simple terms . 
It 's a story about us , people , being persuaded to spend money we do n't have on things we do n't need to create impressions that wo n't last on people we do n't care about . 
But before we consign ourselves to despair , maybe we should just go back and say , " Did we get this right ? 
Is this really how people are ? 
Is this really how economies behave ? " 
And almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies . 
The first one is in the crisis itself . 
In the crisis , in the recession , what do people want to do ? 
They want to hunker down , they want to look to the future . 
They want to spend less and save more . 
But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do from the system point of view . 
Keynes called this the " paradox of thrift " -- saving slows down recovery . 
And politicians call on us continually to draw down more debt , to draw down our own savings even further , just so that we can get the show back on the road , so we can keep this growth - based economy going . 
It 's an anomaly , it 's a place where the system actually is at odds with who we are as people . 
Here 's another one -- completely different one : Why is it that we do n't do the blindingly obvious things we should do to combat climate change , very , very simple things like buying energy - efficient appliances , putting in efficient lights , turning the lights off occasionally , insulating our homes ? 
These things save carbon , they save energy , they save us money . 
So is it that , though they make perfect economic sense , we do n't do them ? 
Well , I had my own personal insight into this a few years ago . 
It was a Sunday evening , Sunday afternoon , and it was just after -- actually , to be honest , too long after -- we had moved into a new house . 
And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping , installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts . 
And my , then , five year - old daughter was helping me in the way that five year - olds do . 
And we 'd been doing this for a while , when she turned to me very solemnly and said , " Will this really keep out the giraffes ? " 
" Here they are , the giraffes . " 
You can hear the five - year - old mind working . 
These ones , interestingly , are 400 miles north of here outside Barrow - in - Furness in Cumbria . 
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather . 
But actually that childish misrepresentation stuck with me , because it suddenly became clear to me why we do n't do the blindingly obvious things . 
We 're too busy keeping out the giraffes -- putting the kids on the bus in the morning , getting ourselves to work on time , surviving email overload and shop floor politics , foraging for groceries , throwing together meals , escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening into prime - time TV or TED online , getting from one end of the day to the other , keeping out the giraffes . 
What is the objective ? 
" What is the objective of the consumer ? " 
Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty written 35 years ago . 
" It is , " she said , " to help create the social world and find a credible place in it . " 
That is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives , and it 's a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model . 
So who are we ? 
Who are these people ? 
Are we these novelty - seeking , hedonistic , selfish individuals ? 
Or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in Rembrandt 's lovely , lovely sketch here ? 
Well psychology actually says there is a tension -- a tension between self - regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors . 
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots , so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances -- fight or flight . 
But other regarding behaviors are essential to our evolution as social beings . 
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view , another tension between novelty - seeking behaviors and tradition or conservation . 
Novelty is adaptive when things are changing and you need to adapt yourself . 
Tradition is essential to lay down the stability to raise families and form cohesive social groups . 
So here , all of a sudden , we 're looking at a map of the human heart . 
And it reveals to us , suddenly , the crux of the matter . 
What we 've done is we 've created economies . 
We 've created systems , which systematically privilege , encourage , one narrow quadrant of the human soul and left the others unregarded . 
And in the same token , the solution becomes clear , because this is n't , therefore , about changing human nature . 
It is n't , in fact , about curtailing possibilities . 
It is about opening up . 
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom to become fully human , recognizing the depth and the breadth of the human psyche and building institutions to protect Rembrandt 's fragile altruist within . 
What does all this mean for economics ? 
What would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche ? 
Well , it might look a little bit like the 4,000 community - interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States , enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart -- companies , in fact , like this one , Ecosia . 
And I just want to , very quickly , show you this . 
Ecosia is an Internet search engine . 
Internet search engines work by drawing revenues from sponsored links that appear when you do a search . 
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way . 
So we can do that here -- we can just put in a little search term . 
There you go , Oxford , that 's where we are . See what comes up . 
The difference with Ecosia though is that , in Ecosia 's case , it draws the revenues in the same way , but it allocates 80 percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon . 
And we 're going to do it . 
We 're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk . 
In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession , that 's the page to go to . 
And what happened then was the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia , and Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues to a rainforest protection project . 
It 's taking profits from one place and allocating them into the protection of ecological resources . 
It 's a different kind of enterprise for a new economy . 
It 's a form , if you like , of ecological altruism -- perhaps something along those lines . Maybe it 's that . 
Whatever it is , whatever this new economy is , what we need the economy to do , in fact , is to put investment back into the heart of the model , to re - conceive investment . 
Only now , investment is n't going to be about the relentless and mindless pursuit of consumption growth . 
Investment has to be a different beast . 
Investment has to be , in the new economy , protecting and nurturing the ecological assets on which our future depends . 
It has to be about transition . 
It has to be investing in low - carbon technologies and infrastructures . 
We have to invest , in fact , in the idea of a meaningful prosperity , providing capabilities for people to flourish . 
And of course , this task has material dimensions . 
It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing if they did n't have food , clothing and shelter . 
But it 's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this . 
It has social and psychological aims -- family , friendship , commitments , society , participating in the life of that society . 
And this too requires investment , investment -- for example , in places -- places where we can connect , places where we can participate , shared spaces , concert halls , gardens , public parks , libraries , museums , quiet centers , places of joy and celebration , places of tranquility and contemplation , sites for the " cultivation of a common citizenship , " in Michael Sandel 's lovely phrase . 
An investment -- investment , after all , is just such a basic economic concept -- is nothing more nor less than a relationship between the present and the future , a shared present and a common future . 
And we need that relationship to reflect , to reclaim hope . 
So let me come back , with this sense of hope , to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door . 
What can we offer those people ? 
It 's clear that we have a responsibility to help lift them out of poverty . 
It 's clear that we have a responsibility to make room for growth where growth really matters in those poorest nations . 
And it 's also clear that we will never achieve that unless we 're capable of redefining a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations , a prosperity that is more meaningful and less materialistic than the growth - based model . 
So this is not just a Western post - materialist fantasy . 
In fact , an African philosopher wrote to me , when " Prosperity Without Growth " was published , pointing out the similarities between this view of prosperity and the traditional African concept of ubuntu . 
Ubuntu says , " I am because we are . " 
Prosperity is a shared endeavor . 
Its roots are long and deep -- its foundations , I 've tried to show , exist already , inside each of us . 
So this is not about standing in the way of development . 
It 's not about overthrowing capitalism . 
It 's not about trying to change human nature . 
What we 're doing here is we 're taking a few simple steps towards an economics fit for purpose . 
And at the heart of that economics , we 're placing a more credible , more robust , and more realistic vision of what it means to be human . 
Thank you very much . 
Chris Anderson : While they 're taking the podium away , just a quick question . 
First of all , economists are n't supposed to be inspiring , so you may need to work on the tone a little . 
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ? 
I mean , can you picture a politician standing up in Britain and saying , " GDP fell two percent this year . Good news ! 
We 're actually all happier , and a country 's more beautiful , and our lives are better . " 
Tim Jackson : Well that 's clearly not what you 're doing . 
You 're not making news out of things falling down . 
You 're making news out of the things that tell you that we 're flourishing . 
Can I picture politicians doing it ? 
Actually , I already am seeing a little bit of it . 
When we first started this kind of work , politicians would stand up , treasury spokesmen would stand up , and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves . 
And actually in the period through which we 've been working over the last 18 years -- partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics -- actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world . 
CA : But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together , or is it going to be more just civil society and companies ? 
TJ : It has to be companies . It has to be civil society . 
But it has to have political leadership . 
This is a kind of agenda , which actually politicians themselves are kind of caught in that dilemma , because they 're hooked on the growth model themselves . 
But actually opening up the space to think about different ways of governing , different kinds of politics , and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently -- absolutely vital . 
CA : And if someone could convince you that we actually can make the -- what was it ? -- the 130-fold improvement in efficiency , of reduction of carbon footprint , would you then actually like that picture of economic growth into more knowledge - based goods ? 
TJ : I would still want to know that you could do that and get below zero by the end of the century , in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere , and solve the problem of biodiversity and reduce the impact on land use and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water . 
If you can convince me we can do all that , then , yes , I would take the two percent . 
CA : Tim , thank you for a very important talk . Thank you .

In the Gulf oil spill 's aftermath , Lisa Margonelli says drilling moratoriums and executive ousters make for good theater , but distract from the issue at its heart : our unrestrained oil consumption . She shares her bold plan to wean America off of oil -- by confronting consumers with its real cost .

Lisa Margonelli : The political chemistry of oil 
So I 'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills and why this is an incredibly important , long , oily , hot summer , and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted . 
But before I talk about the political chemistry , I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil . 
This is a photograph from when I visited Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002 to watch the Minerals Management Service testing their ability to burn oil spills in ice . 
And what you see here is , you see a little bit of crude oil , you see some ice cubes , and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm . 
The napalm is burning there quite nicely . 
And the thing is , is that oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer . 
We 're four percent of the world 's population ; we use 25 percent of the world 's oil production . 
And we do n't really understand what oil is , until you check out its molecules , And you do n't really understand that until you see this stuff burn . 
So this is what happens as that burn gets going . 
It takes off . It 's a big woosh . 
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday , because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again . 
It 'll just bake your retinas . 
So there it is ; the retinas are baking . 
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil . 
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules . 
It starts of with the very small ones , which are one carbon , four hydrogen -- that 's methane -- it just floats off . 
Then there 's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon . 
You 've probably heard of benzene rings ; they 're very carcinogenic . 
And it goes all the way over to these big , thick , galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons , and they have thousands of hydrogens , and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them . 
Those are called the asphaltenes ; they 're an ingredient in asphalt . 
They 're very important in oil spills . 
Let me tell you a little bit about the chemistry of oil in water . 
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous . 
Oil does n't sink , it floats . 
If it sank , it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill . 
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water . 
It spreads out to be really thin , so you have a hard time corralling it . 
The next thing that happens is the light ends evaporate , and some of the toxic things float into the water column and kill fish eggs and smaller fish and things like that , and shrimp . 
And then the asphaltenes -- and this is the crucial thing -- the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves into a frothy emulsion , something like mayonnaise . 
It triples the amount of oily , messy goo that you have in the water , and it makes it very hard to handle . 
It also makes it very viscous . 
When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain , there were big , floating cushions the size of sofa cushions of emulsified oil , with the consistency , or the viscosity , of chewing gum . 
It 's incredibly hard to clean up . 
And every single oil is different when it hits water . 
When the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics , it 's absolutely explosive . 
For the first time , American consumers will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves . 
They have a " eureka ! " moment , when we suddenly understand oil in a different context . 
So I 'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics , because it 's really crucial to understanding why this summer is so important , why we need to stay focused . 
Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks , " Wow ! I 'm going to go buy some three - carbon - to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank and drive happily to work . " 
No , they think , " Ugh . I have to go buy gas . 
I 'm so angry about it . The oil companies are ripping me off . 
They set the prices , and I do n't even know . 
I am helpless over this . " 
And this is what happens to us at the gas pump -- and actually , gas pumps are specifically designed to diffuse that anger . 
You might notice that many gas pumps , including this one , are designed to look like ATMs . 
I 've talked to engineers . That 's specifically to diffuse our anger , because supposedly we feel good about ATMs . 
That shows you how bad it is . 
But actually , I mean , this feeling of helplessness comes in because most Americans actually feel that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy , not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market . 
And the thing is , too , is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume , which is somewhat reasonable , because in fact , we have designed this system where , if you want to get a job , it 's much more important to have a car that runs , to have a job and keep a job , than to have a GED . 
And that 's actually very perverse . 
Now there 's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas , which is that we 'd rather be doing anything else . 
This is BP 's gas station in downtown Los Angeles . 
It is green . It is a shrine to greenishness . 
" Now , " you think , " why would something so lame work on people so smart ? " 
Well , the reason is , is because , when we 're buying gas , we 're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance . 
I mean , we 're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else . 
We do n't want to be buying oil ; we want to be doing something green . 
And we get kind of in on our own con . 
I mean -- and this is funny , it looks funny here . 
But in fact , that 's why the slogan " beyond petroleum " worked . 
But it 's an inherent part of our energy policy , which is we do n't talk about reducing the amount of oil that we use . 
We talk about energy independence . We talk about hydrogen cars . 
We talk about biofuels that have n't been invented yet . 
And so , cognitive dissonance is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil , and it 's really important to dealing with this oil spill . 
Okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the United States . 
The oil industry is like a huge , gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else , but we actually see it in very moral terms . 
This is an early - on photograph -- you can see , we had these gushers . 
Early journalists looked at these spills , and they said , " This is a filthy industry . " 
But they also saw in it that people were getting rich for doing nothing . 
They were n't farmers , they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground . 
It 's the " Beverly Hillbillies , " basically . 
But in the beginning , this was seen as a very morally problematic thing , long before it became funny . 
And then , of course , there was John D. Rockefeller . 
And the thing about John D. is that he went into this chaotic wild - east of oil industry , and he rationalized it into a vertically integrated company , a multinational . 
It was terrifying ; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now , imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s . 
And it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy . 
But what 's really amazing is that Ida Tarbell , the journalist , went in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller and actually got the whole antitrust laws put in place . 
But in many ways , that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us . 
And here 's one of the things that Ida Tarbell said -- she said , " He has a thin nose like a thorn . 
There were no lips . 
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them . " 
Okay , so that guy is actually still with us . 
I mean , this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA . 
And then there 's this guy , okay . 
So , you might be wondering why it is that , every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill , we call these CEOs down to Washington , and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them . 
And this is something that we 've been doing since 1974 , when we first asked them , " Why are there these obscene profits ? " 
And we 've sort of personalized the whole oil industry into these CEOs . 
And we take it as , you know -- we look at it on a moral level , rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level . 
And so I 'm not saying these guys are n't liable to answer questions -- I 'm just saying that , when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards , you do n't actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate , or you 're going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil . 
So I 'm saying this is kind of a distraction . 
But it makes for good theater , and it 's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week . 
So the thing about water oil spills is that they are very politically galvanizing . 
I mean , these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill . 
You have these pictures of birds . 
They really influence people . 
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969 , it formed the environmental movement in its modern form . 
It started Earth Day . 
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act , the Clean Air Act , the Clean Water Act . 
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period . 
I think it 's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds and understand what happens to us . 
Here we are normally ; we 're standing at the gas pump , and we 're feeling kind of helpless . 
We look at these pictures and we understand , for the first time , our role in this supply chain . 
We connect the dots in the supply chain . 
And we have this kind of -- as voters , we have kind of a " eureka ! " moment . 
This is why these moments of these oil spills are so important . 
But it 's also really important that we do n't get distracted by the theater or the morals of it . 
We actually need to go in and work on the roots of the problem . 
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills was that we really worked on some of the symptoms . 
We were very reactive , as opposed to being proactive about what happened . 
And so what we did was , actually , we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling . 
We stopped drilling in ANWR , but we did n't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed . 
In fact , it 's continued to increase . 
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices . 
As you can see , our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out . 
We only have two percent of the world 's oil reserves ; 65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf . 
One of the things that 's happened because of this is that , since 1969 , the country of Nigeria , or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil , which is the delta -- which is two times the size of Maryland -- has had thousands of oil spills a year . 
I mean , we 've essentially been exporting oil spills when we import oil from places without tight environmental regulations . 
That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill every year since 1969 . 
And we can wrap our heads around the spills , because that 's what we see here , but in fact , these guys actually live in a war zone . 
There 's a thousand battle - related deaths a year in this area twice the size of Maryland , and it 's all related to the oil . 
And these guys , I mean , if they were in the U.S. , they might be actually here in this room . 
They have degrees in political science , degrees in business -- they 're entrepreneurs . They do n't actually want to be doing what they 're doing . 
And it 's sort of one of the other groups of people who pay a price for us . 
The other thing that we 've done , as we 've continued to increase demand , is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs . 
One of the places we put in a big oil project in Chad , with Exxon . 
So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it ; the World Bank , Exxon paid for it . 
We put it in . There was a tremendous banditry problem . 
I was there in 2003 . 
We were driving along this dark , dark road , and the guy in the green stepped out , and I was just like , " Ahhh ! This is it . " 
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out , and we realized it was okay . 
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields . 
But at the same time , Chad has become much more unstable , and we are not paying for that price at the pump . 
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th . 
We do the same thing with the price of policing the Persian Gulf and keeping the shipping lanes open . 
This is 1988 -- we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year . 
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump . 
We pay for it on April 15th , and we ca n't even calculate the cost of this involvement . 
The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil and our increased consumption is the Gulf of Mexico , which was not part of the moratoriums . 
Now what 's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see , this is the Minerals Management diagram of wells for gas and oil . 
It 's become this intense industrialized zone . 
It does n't have the same resonance for us that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has , but it should , I mean , it 's a bird sanctuary . 
Also , every time you buy gasoline in the United States , half of it is actually being refined along the coast , because the Gulf actually has about 50 percent of our refining capacity and a lot of our marine terminals as well . 
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less - clean environment . 
And finally , American families also pay a price for oil . 
Now on the one hand , the price at the pump is not really very high when you consider the actual cost of the oil , but on the other hand , the fact that people have no other transit options means that they pay a large amount of their income into just getting back and forth to work , generally in a fairly crummy car . 
If you look at people who make $ 50,000 a year , they have two kids , they might have three jobs or more , and then they have to really commute . 
They 're actually spending more on their car and fuel than they are on taxes or on health care . 
And the same thing happens at the 50th percentile , around 80,000 . 
Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the American economy , but they 're also a drain on individual families and it 's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher . 
So , what I 'm going to talk to you about now is : what do we have to do this time ? 
What are the laws ? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused ? 
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater . 
We need to stay away from the moratoriums . 
We need to focus really back again on the molecules . 
The moratoriums are fine , but we do need to focus on the molecules on the oil . 
One of the things that we also need to do , is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves into thinking that you can have a green world , before you reduce the amount of oil that we use . 
We need to focus on reducing the oil . 
What you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy . 
It comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray , and the un - useful stuff , which is called the rejected energy -- the waste , goes up to the top . 
Now you can see that the waste far outweighs the actually useful amount . 
And one of the things that we need to do is , not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient , but we also need to fix the economy in general . 
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel . 
For example , we have an insurance system where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000 . 
We actually encourage people to drive more . 
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies . 
We need to have more mobility choices . 
We need to make the gas price better reflect the real cost of oil . 
And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry , which is at least 10 billion dollars a year , into something that allows middle - class people to find better ways to commute . 
Whether that 's getting a much more efficient car and also kind of building markets for new cars and new fuels down the road , this is where we need to be . 
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing , and you can find more about this policy . 
It 's called STRONG , which is " Secure Transportation Reducing Oil Needs Gradually , " and the idea is instead of being helpless , we need to be more strong . 
They 're up at NewAmerica.net . 
What 's important about these is that we try to move from feeling helpless at the pump , to actually being active and to really sort of thinking about who we are , having kind of that special moment , where we connect the dots actually at the pump . 
Now supposedly , oil taxes are the third rail of American politics -- the no - fly zone . 
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil is probably too much , but I think that if we started this year with three cents a gallon on gasoline , and upped it to six cents next year , nine cents the following year , all the way up to 30 cents by 2020 , that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption , and at the same time we would give people time to prepare , time to respond , and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time . 
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work . 
This is a gas receipt , hypothetically , for a year from now . 
The first thing that you have on the tax is -- you have a tax for a stronger America -- 33 cents . 
So you 're not helpless at the pump . 
And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign , very similar to what you would find on a cigarette pack . 
And what it says is , " The National Academy of Sciences estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car creates 29 cents in health care costs . " 
That 's a lot . 
And so this -- you can see that you 're paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax . 
And also , the hope is that you start to be connected to the whole greater system . 
And at the same time , you have a number that you can call to get more information on commuting , or a low - interest loan on a different kind of car , or whatever it is you 're going to need to actually reduce your gasoline dependence . 
With this whole sort of suite of policies , we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption -- or our oil consumption -- by 20 percent by 2020 . 
So , three million barrels a day . 
But in order to do this , one of the things we really need to do , is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon . 
We need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater , not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there . 
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules . 
Thank you .

Cynthia Schneider : The surprising spread of " Idol " TV 
I 'd like to ask you , what do these three people have in common ? 
Well , you probably recognize the first person . 
I 'm sure you 're all avid " American Idol " watchers . 
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani , who is a contestant , indeed a finalist , in the Poet of the Millions competition , which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi , and seen throughout the Arab world . 
In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry , in the Nabati form of poetry , which is the traditional Bedouin form . 
And Lima Sahar was a finalist in the Afghan Star singing competition . 
Now , before I go any further , yes , I know it all began with " Britain 's Got Talent . " 
But my point in discussing this is to show you -- I hope I 'll be able to show you how these merit - based competitions , with equal access to everyone , with the winner selected via voting by SMS , are changing tribal societies . 
And I 'm going to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE , how they 're changing tribal societies , not by introducing Western ideas , but by being integrated into the language in those places . 
It all begins with enjoyment . 
Video : We are late to watch " Afghan Star . " 
We are going to watch " Afghan Star . " We are late . 
We are running late . 
We must go to watch " Afghan Star . " 
Cynthia Schneider : These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society . 
In Afghanistan , people go to extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program . 
And you do n't necessarily have to have your own TV set . 
People watch it all over the country also in public places . 
But it goes beyond watching , because also , part of this is campaigning . 
People become so engaged that they have volunteers , just like political volunteers anyway , who fan out over the countryside , campaigning for their candidate . 
Contestants also put themselves forward . 
Now , of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance , but not entirely . 
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group . 
This has opened up the door , particularly for women . 
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists . 
One of them , Lima Sahar , is a Pashtun from Kandahar , a very conservative part of the country . 
And here she relates , in the documentary film " Afghan Star , " how her friends urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy . 
But she also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS - ing votes in for her . 
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out , to compete in the Poet of the Millions competition . 
I have to say , her husband backed her from the start . 
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it . 
But , once she started to win , then they got behind her again . 
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value . 
And she 's out there . 
Her poetry is about women , and the life of women in society . 
So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men -- this shows the voting on the program -- it sets a very important example for young women -- these are young women in the audience of the program -- in Abu Dhabi , but also people in the viewing audience . 
Now you 'd think that " American Idol " would introduce a measure of Americanization . 
But actually , just the opposite is happening . 
By using this engaging popular format for traditional , local culture , it actually , in the Gulf , is precipitating a revival of interest in Nabati poetry , also in traditional dress and dance and music . 
And for Afghanistan , where the Taliban banned music for many years , it is reintroducing their traditional music . 
They do n't sing pop songs , they sing Afghan music . 
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully , without avenging the winner . 
No small thing . 
And the final , sort of , formulation of this " American Idol " format , which has just appeared in Afghanistan , is a new program called " The Candidate . " 
And in this program , people present policy platforms that are then voted on . 
Many of them are too young to run for president , but by putting the issues out there , they are influencing the presidential race . 
So for me , the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving reality . 
Thank you .

After he swam the North Pole , Lewis Pugh vowed never to take another cold - water dip . Then he heard of Lake Imja in the Himalayas , created by recent glacial melting , and Lake Pumori , a body of water at an altitude of 5300 m on Everest -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change .

Lewis Pugh 's mind - shifting Everest swim 
Last year when I was here , I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole . 
And while that swim took place three years ago , I can remember it as if it was yesterday . 
I remember standing on the edge of the ice , about to dive into the water , and thinking to myself , I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening . 
The water is completely black . 
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade , or 29 degrees Fahrenheit . 
It 's flipping freezing in that water . 
And then a thought came across my mind : if things go pear - shaped on this swim , how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ? 
And then I said to myself , I 've just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible . 
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up , listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy , and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made - up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water . 
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days . 
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers , and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know , we 're made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands , and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst . 
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following : I 'm never , ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again . 
Anyway , last year , I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the -- and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change . 
I heard about this lake , Lake Imja . 
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier . 
The glacier 's gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake . 
And I firmly believe that what we 're seeing in the Himalayas is the next great , big battleground on this earth . 
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas . 
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is , and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much , I think we have a real risk of instability . 
North , you 've got China ; south , you 've India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , all these countries . 
And so I decided to walk up to Mt. Everest , the highest mountain on this earth , and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt. Everest . 
Now , I do n't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest , but it 's quite an ordeal getting up there . 
28 great , big , powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I do n't just have my Speedo , but there 's a big film crew who then send all the images around the world . 
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude . 
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level . 
So it 's right up in the heavens . 
It 's very , very difficult to breath . You get altitude sickness . 
I feels like you 've got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time . 
That 's not the worst part of it . 
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest . 
Many , many people have died on Mt. Everest , and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain . 
And when you 're walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before , and , in fact , no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you 're trying to do that , and then the bodies are coming past you , it humbles you , and you also realize very , very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are . 
And we walked up this pathway , all the way up . 
And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier . 
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice . 
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt. Everest , and I prepared myself the same way as I 've always prepared myself , for this swim which was going to be so very difficult . 
I put on my iPod , I listened to some music , I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hurled myself into that water . 
I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters , and then I realized very , very quickly , I had a huge problem on my hands . 
I could barely breathe . 
I was gasping for air . 
I then began to choke , and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water . 
And it all happened so quickly : I then -- I do n't know how it happened -- but I went underwater . 
And luckily , the water was quite shallow , and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air . 
And then I said , carry on . Carry on . Carry on . 
I carried on for another five or six strokes , and then I had nothing in my body , and I went down to the bottom of the lake . 
And I do n't where I got it from , but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake . 
I 've heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have . 
I have never , ever heard such utter bollocks . 
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have . 
I got myself to the side of the lake . 
My crew grabbed me , and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rubble -- down to our camp . 
And there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt. Everest . 
And my team just gave it to me straight . 
They said , Lewis , you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim . 
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming , you must forget . 
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army , about speed and aggression , you put that to one side . 
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days ' time . 
Take some time to rest and think about things . 
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days ' time , and instead of swimming fast , swim as slowly as possible . 
Instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke . 
And remember , never ever swim with aggression . 
This is the time to swim with real humility . 
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later . 
And I stood there on the edge of the lake , and I looked up at Mt. Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself , just do this slowly . 
And I swam across the lake . 
And I ca n't begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side . 
But I learned two very , very important lessons there on Mt. Everest , and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this . 
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well , does n't mean it 's going to work in the future . 
And similarly , now , before I do anything , I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task . 
And taking that into the world of climate change -- which is , frankly , the Mt. Everest of all problems -- just because we 've lived the way we have lived for so long , just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long , does n't mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on . 
The warning signs are all there . 
When I was born , the world 's population was 3.5 billion people . 
We 're now 6.8 billion people , and we 're expected to be 9 billion people by 2050 . 
And then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift . 
And I 've come here to ask you today : what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment , which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world , and most importantly , in a sustainable world ? 
And I ask you , please , to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make , which will make that big difference , and then commit a hundred percent to doing it . 
Blog about it , tweet about it , talk about it , and commit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it . 
So thank you very , very much .

Saul Griffith on everyday inventions 
So anyway , who am I ? 
I usually say to people , when they say , " What do you do ? " 
I say , " I do hardware , " because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do . 
And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some Valley event , to which he replied , " How quaint . " 
And I sort of really was dumbstruck . 
And I really should have said something smart . 
And now I 've had a little bit of time to think about it , I would have said , " Well , you know , if we look at the next 100 years and we 've seen all these problems in the last few days , most of the big issues -- clean water , clean energy -- and they 're interchangeable in some respects -- and cleaner , more functional materials -- they all look to me to be hardware problems . 
This does n't mean we should ignore software , or information , or computation . " 
And that 's in fact probably what I 'm going to try and tell you about . 
So , this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we 're going to make things in the future . 
Now , TED sends you a lot of spam if you 're a speaker about " do this , do that " and you fill out all these forms , and you do n't actually know how they 're going to describe you , and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist . 
And I 've always been nervous about the term " futurist , " because you seem doomed to failure because you ca n't really predict it . 
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have , and said , " You know , well , if I have to talk about the future , what is it ? " 
And George Homsey , a great guy , said , " Oh , the future is amazing . 
It is so much stranger than you think . 
We 're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut , and we 're going to make your poo smell like peppermint . " 
So , you may think that 's sort of really crazy , but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible . 
So , this is n't my work , but it 's work of good friends of mine at MIT . 
This is called the registry of standard biological parts . 
This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight and a few other very , very bright individuals . 
Basically , what they 're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system . 
Literally , think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program . 
Now , this is actually becoming such an interesting idea . 
This is a state diagram . That 's an extremely simple computer . 
This one is a two - bit counter . 
So that 's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches . 
And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich for a design competition in biology . 
And from the results of the same competition last year , a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off . 
So this is interesting in the sense that you can now do " if - then - for " statements in materials , in structure . 
This is a pretty interesting trend , because we used to live in a world where everyone 's said glibly , " Form follows function , " but I think I 've sort of grown up in a world -- you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday ; I was in a lab associated with his -- where it 's really a world where information defines form and function . 
I spent six years thinking about that , but to show you the power of art over science -- this is actually one of the cartoons I write . These are called " HowToons . " 
I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta . 
Took me six years at MIT , and about that many pages to describe what I was doing , and it took him one page . And so this is our muse Tucker . 
He 's an interesting little kid -- and his sister , Celine -- and what he 's doing here is observing the self - assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl . 
And in fact you can program the self - assembly of things , so he starts chocolate - dipping edges , changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity . 
In theory , if you program those sufficiently , you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure . 
In this case , he 's done self - replication of a complex 3D structure . 
And that 's what I thought about for a long time , because this is how we currently make things . 
This is a silicon wafer , and essentially that 's just a whole bunch of layers of two - dimensional stuff , sort of layered up . 
The feature side is -- you know , people will say , [ unclear ] down around about 65 nanometers now . 
On the right , that 's a radiolara . 
That 's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans . 
And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers , and it 's a complex 3D structure . 
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way . 
The secret to biology is , it builds computation into the way it makes things . So this little thing here , polymerase , is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA . 
And the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins . 
I thought about this in the sense that it 's great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ? 
Can we get self - replicating - type behavior ? 
Can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems ? 
Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems , like higher speed semiconductors , etc . 
So , this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self - replicating system . 
And this is sort of Babbage 's revenge . 
These are little mechanical computers . 
These are five - state state machines . 
So , that 's about three light switches lined up . 
In a neutral state , they wo n't bind at all . 
Now , if I make a string of these , a bit string , they will be able to replicate . 
So we start with white , blue , blue , white . 
That encodes ; that will now copy . From one comes two , and then from two comes three . 
And so you 've got this sort of replicating system . 
It was work actually by Lionel Penrose , father of Roger Penrose , the tiles guy . 
He did a lot of this work in the ' 60s , and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution , but it 's now coming back . 
So now I 'm going to show you the hands - free , autonomous self - replication . 
So we 've tracked in the video the input string , which was green , green , yellow , yellow , green . 
We set them off on this air hockey table . 
You know , high science uses air hockey tables -- -- and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy , but what you 're actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here . 
So we 've got autonomous replication of bit strings . 
So , why would you want to replicate bit strings ? 
Well , it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme , that you can take a linear string , which is a convenient thing to copy , and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure . 
So I was trying to , you know , take the engineer 's version : Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing ? 
So what I 'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape -- the B -- assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules . 
And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here , and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design , was that you do n't need digital logic to do computation . 
And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips . 
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process . 
So , Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday , I believe , but I 'll show you again . 
This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles . 
Each different color has a different magnetic polarity , and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out . 
Now , hopefully , those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that , and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure , and in fact , you know , I can now take a dog , carve it up and then reassemble it so it 's a linear string that will fold from a sequence . And now I can actually define that three - dimensional object as a sequence of bits . 
So , you know , it 's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently . 
And the universe is now a compiler . 
And so I 'm thinking about , you know , what are the programs for programming the physical universe ? 
And how do we think about materials and structure , sort of as an information and computation problem ? 
Not just where you attach a micro - controller to the end point , but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic , are the computers . 
Having totally absorbed this philosophy , I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently . 
With the universe as a computer , you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations . 
You set a couple of boundary conditions , like gravity , the surface tension , density , etc . , and then you press " execute , " and magically , the universe produces you a perfect ball lens . 
So , this actually applied to the problem of -- so there 's a half a billion to a billion people in the world do n't have access to cheap eyeglasses . 
So can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site ? 
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition . 
If it 's circular , you make a spherical lens . 
If it 's elliptical , you can make an astigmatic lens . 
You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -- so that 's part of the extra program . 
And literally with only those two inputs -- so , the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error , from minus 12 to plus eight diopters , up to four diopters of cylinder . 
And then literally , you now pour on a monomer . 
You know , I 'll do a Julia Childs here . 
This is three minutes of UV light . 
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you 've cooked it . Pop it out . 
I 've seen this video , but I still do n't know if it 's going to end right . 
So you reverse this . This is a very old movie , so with the new prototypes , actually both surfaces are flexible , but this will show you the point . 
Now you 've finished the lens , you literally pop it out . 
That 's next year 's Yves Klein , you know , eyeglasses shape . 
And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters . 
And as I rotate it against this side shot , you 'll see that that has cylinder , and that was programmed in -- literally into the physics of the system . 
So , this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things , like this . 
This is something that my people at SQUID Labs are working on at the moment , called " electronic rope . " 
So literally , you think about a rope . It has very complex structure in the weave . 
And under no load , it 's one structure . 
Under a different load , it 's a different structure . And you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor . 
So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope . 
Just by thinking about the physics of the world , materials as the computer , you can start to do things like this . 
I 'm going to segue a little here . 
I guess I 'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this . 
One thing I 'm really interested about this right now is , how , if you 're really taking this view of the universe as a computer , how do we make things in a very general sense , and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware ? 
And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems , share the information and work on those things together . 
So , a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time , and unless Lisa Randall changes that , we 'll continue to move in linear time . 
So that means anything you do , or anything you make , you produce a sequence of steps -- and I think Lego in the ' 70s nailed this , and they did it most elegantly . 
But they can show you how to build things in sequence . 
So , I 'm thinking about , how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things , so you end up with this sort of guy , right ? 
And I think this applies across a very broad -- sort of , a lot of concepts . 
You know , Cameron Sinclair yesterday said , " How do I get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity ? " 
And if you 've seen Amy Smith , she talks about how you get students at MIT to work with communities in Haiti . 
And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things , so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other 's source code for structure . 
I do n't know exactly how to do this yet , but , you know , it 's something being actively thought about . 
So , you know , that leads to questions like , is this a compiler ? Is this a sub - routine ? 
Interesting things like that . 
Maybe I 'm getting a little too abstract , but you know , this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters -- this is sort of the universe , or a different universe view , that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future -- from biotech to materials assembly . It was great to hear Bill Joy . 
They 're starting to invest in materials science , but these are the new things in materials science . 
How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas , and see the world in a different way ? And it 's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it 's sort of an analog computer . 
But it 's definitely an interesting new worldview . 
I 've gone too far . So that sounds like it 's it . 
I 've probably got a couple of minutes of questions , or I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff in the introduction , so I may have to explain that . 
So maybe I 'll do that with this short video . 
So this is actually a 3,000-square - foot kite , which also happens to be a minimal energy surface . 
So returning to the droplet , again , thinking about the universe in a new way . 
This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp . 
And why do you want a 3,000-square - foot kite ? 
So that 's a kite the size of your house . 
And so you want that to tow boats very fast . 
So I 've been working on this a little , also , with a couple of other guys . 
But , you know , this is another way to look at the -- if you abstract again , this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe . 
You could just hang it as a bed sheet , but again , the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape . 
And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that . So that 's sort of another interesting aspect of the future .

Alex Steffen : The shareable future of cities 
Climate change is already a heavy topic , and it 's getting heavier because we 're understanding that we need to do more than we are . 
We 're understanding , in fact , that those of us who live in the developed world need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions . 
That 's , to put it mildly , not what 's on the table now . 
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming when we look at what is there in reality today and the magnitude of the problem that we face . 
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us , we tend to seek simple answers . 
And I think this is what we 've done with climate change . 
We look at where the emissions are coming from -- they 're coming out of our tailpipes and smokestacks and so forth , and we say , okay , well the problem is that they 're coming out of fossil fuels that we 're burning , so therefore , the answer must be to replace those fossil fuels with clean sources of energy . 
And while , of course , we do need clean energy , I would put to you that it 's possible that by looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem , we 're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it . 
And the reason why is that we live on a planet that is rapidly urbanizing . 
That should n't be news to any of us . 
However , it 's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization . 
By mid - century , we 're going to have about eight billion -- perhaps more -- people living in cities or within a day 's travel of one . 
We will be an overwhelmingly urban species . 
In order to provide the kind of energy that it would take for eight billion people living in cities that are even somewhat like the cities that those of us in the global North live in today , we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy . 
It may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy . 
So if we 're seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet , we need to look somewhere else for the solution . 
The solution , in fact , may be closer to hand than we think , because all of those cities we 're building are opportunities . 
Every city determines to a very large extent the amount of energy used by its inhabitants . 
We tend to think of energy use as a behavioral thing -- I choose to turn this light switch on -- but really , enormous amounts of our energy use are predestined by the kinds of communities and cities that we live in . 
I wo n't show you very many graphs today , but if I can just focus on this one for a moment , it really tells us a lot of what we need to know -- which is , quite simply , that if you look , for example , at transportation , a major category of climate emissions , there is a direct relationship between how dense a city is and the amount of climate emissions that its residents spew out into the air . 
And the correlation , of course , is that denser places tend to have lower emissions -- which is n't really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it . 
Basically , we substitute , in our lives , access to the things we want . 
We go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place . 
And we 're basically using mobility to get the access we need . 
But when we live in a denser community , suddenly what we find , of course , is that the things we need are close by . 
And since the most sustainable trip is the one that you never had to make in the first place , suddenly our lives become instantly more sustainable . 
And it is possible , of course , to increase the density of the communities around us . 
Some places are doing this with new eco districts , developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods , which is nice work if you can get it , but most of the time , what we 're talking about is , in fact , reweaving the urban fabric that we already have . 
So we 're talking about things like infill development : really sharp little changes to where we have buildings , where we 're developing . 
Urban retrofitting : creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there . 
Increasingly , we 're realizing that we do n't even need to densify an entire city . 
What we need instead is an average density that rises to a level where we do n't drive as much and so on . 
And that can be done by raising the density in very specific spots a whole lot . 
So you can think of it as tent poles that actually raise the density of the entire city . 
And we find that when we do that , we can , in fact , have a few places that are really hyper - dense within a wider fabric of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results . 
Now we may find that there are places that are really , really dense and still hold onto their cars , but the reality is that , by and large , what we see when we get a lot of people together with the right conditions is a threshold effect , where people simply stop driving as much , and increasingly , more and more people , if they 're surrounded by places that make them feel at home , give up their cars altogether . 
And this is a huge , huge energy savings , because what comes out of our tailpipe is really just the beginning of the story with climate emissions from cars . 
We have the manufacture of the car , the disposal of the car , all of the parking and freeways and so on . 
When you can get rid of all of those because somebody does n't use any of them really , you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as 90 percent . 
And people are embracing this . 
All around the world , we 're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life . 
People are saying that it 's moving from the idea of the dream home to the dream neighborhood . 
And when you layer that over with the kind of ubiquitous communications that we 're starting to see , what you find is , in fact , even more access suffused into spaces . 
Some of it 's transportation access . 
This is a Mapnificent map that shows me , in this case , how far I can get from my home in 30 minutes using public transportation . 
Some of it is about walking . It 's not all perfect yet . 
This is Google Walking Maps . 
I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway , and it told me to go via Guernsey . 
It did tell me that this route maybe missing sidewalks or pedestrian paths , though . 
But the technologies are getting better , and we 're starting to really kind of crowdsource this navigation . 
And as we just heard earlier , of course , we 're also learning how to put information on dumb objects . 
Things that do n't have any wiring in them at all , we 're learning how to include in these systems of notation and navigation . 
Part of what we 're finding with this is that what we thought was the major point of manufacturing and consumption , which is to get a bunch of stuff , is not , in fact , how we really live best in dense environments . 
What we 're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things . 
My favorite example is a drill . Who here owns a drill , a home power drill ? 
Okay . I do too . 
The average home power drill is used somewhere between six and 20 minutes in its entire lifetime , depending on who you ask . 
And so what we do is we buy these drills that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of drill time , use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit . 
Our cities , I would put to you , are stockpiles of these surplus capacities . 
And while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities -- such as cooking or making ice sculptures or even a mafia hit -- what we probably will find is that , in fact , turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them , is a far smarter way to go . 
And in fact , even space itself is turning into a service . 
We 're finding that people can share the same spaces , do stuff with vacant space . 
Buildings are becoming bundles of services . 
So we have new designs that are helping us take mechanical things that we used to spend energy on -- like heating , cooling etc . -- and turn them into things that we avoid spending energy on . 
So we light our buildings with daylight . 
We cool them with breezes . We heat them with sunshine . 
In fact , when we use all these things , what we 've found is that , in some cases , energy use in a building can drop as much as 90 percent . 
Which brings on another threshold effect I like to call furnace dumping , which is , quite simply , if you have a building that does n't need to be heated with a furnace , you save a whole bunch of money up front . 
These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives . 
Now when we look at being able to slash our product use , slash our transportation use , slash our building energy use , all of that is great , but it still leaves something behind . 
And if we 're going to really , truly become sustainable cities , we need to think a little differently . 
This is one way to do it . 
This is Vancouver 's propaganda about how green a city they are . 
And certainly lots of people have taken to heart this idea that a sustainable city is covered in greenery . 
So we have visions like this . 
We have visions like this . We have visions like this . 
Now all of these are fine projects , but they really have missed an essential point , which is it 's not about the leaves above , it 's about the systems below . 
Do they , for instance , capture rainwater so that we can reduce water use ? 
Water is energy intensive . 
Do they , perhaps , include green infrastructure , so that we can take runoff and water that 's going out of our houses and clean it and filter it and grow urban street trees ? 
Do they connect us back to the ecosystems around us by , for example , connecting us to rivers and allowing for restoration ? 
Do they allow for pollination , pollinator pathways that bees and butterflies and such can come back into our cities ? 
Do they even take the very waste matter that we have from food and fiber and so forth , and turn it back into soil and sequester carbon -- take carbon out of the air in the process of using our cities ? 
I would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible , they 're being done right now , and that it 's a darn good thing . 
Because right now , our economy by and large operates as Paul Hawken said , " by stealing the future , selling it in the present and calling it GDP . " 
And if we have another eight billion or seven billion , or six billion , even , people , living on a planet where their cities also steal the future , we 're going to run out of future really fast . 
But if we think differently , I think that , in fact , we can have cities that are not only zero emissions , but have unlimited possibilities as well . 
Thank you very much .

Steven Pinker on the myth of violence 
Images like this , from the Auschwitz concentration camp , have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century and have given us a new understanding of who we are , where we 've come from and the times we live in . 
During the twentieth century , we witnessed the atrocities of Stalin , Hitler , Mao , Pol Pot , Rwanda and other genocides , and even though the twenty - first century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur and the daily horrors of Iraq . 
This has led to a common understanding of our situation , namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence , and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from , to our peril . 
Here is an example from an op - ed on Thanksgiving , in the Boston Globe a couple of years ago , where the writer wrote , " The Indian life was a difficult one , but there were no employment problems , community harmony was strong , substance abuse unknown , crime nearly non - existent , what warfare there was between tribes was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate or wholesale slaughter . " Now , you 're all familiar with this treacle . 
We teach it to our children . We hear it on television and in storybooks . Now , the original title of this session was , " Everything You Know Is Wrong , " and I 'm going to present evidence that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong , that , in fact , our ancestors were far more violent than we are , that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time , and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species ' existence . 
Now , in the decade of Darfur and Iraq , a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory and obscene . But I 'm going to try to convince you that that is the correct picture . The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon . You can see it over millennia , over centuries , over decades and over years , although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century . One sees it all over the world , although not homogeneously . 
It 's especially evident in the West , beginning with England and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment . 
Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 -- from the millennium scale to the year scale -- to try to persuade you of this . Until 10,000 years ago , all humans lived as hunter - gatherers , without permanent settlements or government . And this is the state that 's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony . But the archaeologist Lawrence Keeley , looking at casualty rates among contemporary hunter - gatherers , which is our best source of evidence about this way of life , has shown a rather different conclusion . 
Here is a graph that he put together showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare in a number of foraging , or hunting and gathering societies . 
The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die at the hands of another man , as opposed to passing away of natural causes , in a variety of foraging societies in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest . 
And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die at the hands of another man to , in the case of the Gebusi , only a 15 percent chance . The tiny , little blue bar in the lower left - hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States and Europe in the twentieth century , and includes all the deaths of both World Wars . If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the 20th century , there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million . 
Also at the millennium scale , we can look at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described in the Bible . And in this supposed source of our moral values , one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare , such as the following from Numbers 31 : " And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses , and they slew all the males . And Moses said unto them , ' Have you saved all the women alive ? Now , therefore , kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him , but all the women children that have not know a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves . ' " In other words , kill the men ; kill the children ; if you see any virgins , then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them . 
You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk . 
Also in the Bible , one sees that the death penalty was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality , adultery , blasphemy , idolatry , talking back to your parents -- -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath . 
Well , let 's click the zoom lens down one order of magnitude , and look at the century scale . 
Although we do n't have statistics for warfare throughout the Middle Ages to modern times , we know just from conventional history -- the evidence was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction in socially sanctioned forms of violence . 
For example , any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment . The kind of infraction today that would give you a fine , in those days would result in your tongue being cut out , your ears being cut off , you being blinded , a hand being chopped off and so on . 
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment : burning at the stake , disemboweling , breaking on the wheel , being pulled apart by horses and so on . 
The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non - violent crimes : criticizing the king , stealing a loaf of bread . Slavery , of course , was the preferred labor - saving device , and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment . Perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning , in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire , and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat , howling in pain , was burned to death . 
What about one - on - one murder ? Well , there , there are good statistics , because many municipalities recorded the cause of death . 
The criminologist Manuel Eisner scoured all of the historical records across Europe for homicide rates in any village , hamlet , town , county that he could find , and he supplemented them with national data , when nations started keeping statistics . 
He plotted on a logarithmic scale , going from 100 deaths per 100,000 people per year , which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages . And the figure plummets down to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year in seven or eight European countries . Then , there is a slight uptick in the 1960s . The people who said that rock ' n ' roll would lead to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that . 
But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present , and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century . 
Let 's click down now to the decade scale . 
According to non - governmental organizations that keep such statistics , since 1945 , in Europe and the Americas , there has been a steep decline in interstate wars , in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms , and in military coups , even in South America . Worldwide , there 's been a steep decline in deaths in interstate wars . The yellow bars here show the number of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present . 
And , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is . 
Even in the year scale , one can see a decline of violence . 
Since the end of the Cold War , there have been fewer civil wars , fewer genocides -- indeed , a 90 percent reduction since post - World War II highs -- and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime . 
This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics . You can see that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the ' 50s and the ' 60s , then it soared upward for several decades , and began a precipitous decline , starting in the 1990s , so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960 . 
President Clinton , if you 're here , thank you . 
So the question is , why are so many people so wrong about something so important ? I think there are a number of reasons . 
One of them is we have better reporting . The Associated Press is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth than sixteenth - century monks were . 
There 's a cognitive illusion . We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is to recall specific instances of something , the higher the probability that you assign to it . 
Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying in their beds of old age . There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets : no one ever attracted observers , advocates and donors by saying things just seem to be getting better and better . 
There 's guilt about our treatment of native peoples in modern intellectual life , and an unwillingness to acknowledge there could be anything good about Western culture . 
And of course , our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior . One of the reasons violence went down is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time . 
That 's a process that seems to be continuing , but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day , things always look more barbaric than they would have been by historic standards . So today , we get exercised -- and rightly so -- if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in Texas after a 15-year appeal process . We do n't consider that a couple of hundred years ago , they may have been burned at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial that lasted 10 minutes , and indeed , that that would have been repeated over and over again . Today , we look at capital punishment as evidence of how low our behavior can sink , rather than how high our standards have risen . 
Well , why has violence declined ? No one really knows , but I have read four explanations , all of which , I think , have some grain of plausibility . The first is , maybe Thomas Hobbes got it right . He was the one who said that life in a state of nature was " solitary , poor , nasty , brutish and short . " Not because , he argued , humans have some primordial thirst for blood or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative , but because of the logic of anarchy . In a state of anarchy , there 's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively , before they invade you . More recently , Thomas Schelling gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling in the basement . Being a good American , he has a pistol in the nightstand , pulls out his gun , and walks down the stairs . 
And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand . 
Now , each one of them is thinking , " I do n't really want to kill that guy , but he 's about to kill me . 
Maybe I had better shoot him , before he shoots me , especially since , even if he does n't want to kill me , he 's probably worrying right now that I might kill him before he kills me . " And so on . 
Hunter - gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought , and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first . 
Now , one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence . 
You do n't strike first , but you have a publicly announced policy that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded . 
The only thing is that it 's liable to having its bluff called , and therefore can only work if it 's credible . To make it credible , you must avenge all insults and settle all scores , which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta . 
Life becomes an episode of " The Sopranos . " Hobbes ' solution , the " Leviathan , " was that if authority for the legitimate use of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan -- then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack , because any kind of aggression will be punished , leaving its profitability as zero . That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively , out of fear of them attacking you first . 
It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation to make your deterrent threat credible . And therefore , it would lead to a state of peace . Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates that you failed to see in the earlier slide -- argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe coincided with the rise of centralized states . 
So that 's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory . 
Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy , in failed states , collapsed empires , frontier regions , mafias , street gangs and so on . 
The second explanation is that in many times and places , there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap . 
In earlier times , when suffering and early death were common in one 's own life , one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them on others . And as technology and economic efficiency make life longer and more pleasant , one puts a higher value on life in general . 
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne . 
A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero - sum game , and was worked out in the book " Nonzero " by the journalist Robert Wright . Wright points out that in certain circumstances , cooperation or non - violence can benefit both parties in an interaction , such as gains in trade when two parties trade their surpluses and both come out ahead , or when two parties lay down their arms and split the so - called peace dividend that results in them not having to fight the whole time . 
Wright argues that technology has increased the number of positive - sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in , by allowing the trade of goods , services and ideas over longer distances and among larger groups of people . 
The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead , and violence declines for selfish reasons . As Wright put it , " Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb the Japanese is that they built my mini - van . " 
The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book called " The Expanding Circle , " by the philosopher Peter Singer , who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense of empathy , an ability to treat other peoples ' interests as comparable to one 's own . Unfortunately , by default we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family . 
People outside that circle are treated as sub - human , and can be exploited with impunity . But , over history , the circle has expanded . One can see , in historical record , it expanding from the village , to the clan , to the tribe , to the nation , to other races , to both sexes , and , in Singer 's own arguments , something that we should extend to other sentient species . The question is , if this has happened , what has powered that expansion ? 
And there are a number of possibilities , such as increasing circles of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for . 
The logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interact with other people , the more you realize that it is untenable to privilege your interests over theirs , at least not if you want them to listen to you . You ca n't say that my interests are special compared to yours , anymore than you can say that the particular spot that I 'm standing on is a unique part of the universe because I happen to be standing on it that very minute . 
It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism , by histories , and journalism , and memoirs , and realistic fiction , and travel , and literacy , which allows you to project yourself into the lives of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub - human , and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station in life , the sense that " there but for fortune go I. " 
Whatever its causes , the decline of violence , I think , has profound implications . It should force us to ask not just , why is there war ? But also , why is there peace ? Not just , what are we doing wrong ? But also , what have we been doing right ? 
Because we have been doing something right , and it sure would be good to find out what it is . 
Thank you very much . 
. 
Chris Anderson : I loved that talk . I think a lot of people here in the room would say that that expansion of -- that you were talking about , that Peter Singer talks about , is also driven by , just by technology , by greater visibility of the other , and the sense that the world is therefore getting smaller . I mean , is that also a grain of truth ? 
Steven Pinker : Very much . It would fit both in Wright 's theory , that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation over larger and larger circles . But also , I think it helps us imagine what it 's like to be someone else . I think when you read these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages , you think , how could they possibly have done it , how could they have not have empathized with the person that they 're disemboweling ? But clearly , as far as they 're concerned , this is just an alien being that does not have feelings akin to their own . Anything , I think , that makes it easier to imagine trading places with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration to that other person . 
CA : Well , Steve , I would love every news media owner to hear that talk at some point in the next year . I think it 's really important . Thank you so much . 
SP : My pleasure .

HIV is a serious problem in the DR Congo , and aid agencies have flooded the country with free and cheap condoms . But few people are using them . Why ? " Reformed marketer " Amy Lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a traditional model of philanthropy .

Amy Lockwood : Selling condoms in the Congo 
I am a reformed marketer , and I now work in international development . 
In October , I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which is the [ second ] largest country in Africa . 
In fact , it 's as large as Western Europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads . 
The DRC is a dangerous place . 
In the past 10 years , five million people have died due to a war in the east . 
But war is n't the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC . 
There are many health issues as well . 
In fact , the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults . 
This might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected . 
And due to the poor infrastructure , only 25 percent of those are receiving the life - saving drugs that they need . 
Which is why , in part , donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost . 
And so while I was in the DRC , I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms , including Damien . 
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa . 
It 's a hotel that 's only open until midnight , so it 's not a place that you stay . 
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come . 
Now Damien knows all about condoms , but he does n't sell them . 
He said there 's just not in demand . 
It 's not surprising , because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms . 
Joseph and Christine , who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms , said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost , and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them , their customers do n't buy the branded versions . 
They like the generics . 
And as a marketer , I found that curious . 
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like . 
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms : fear , financing and fidelity . 
They name the condoms things like Vive , " to live " or Trust . 
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently . 
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom . 
What is it that you think about just before you get a condom ? 
Sex ! 
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places , they understand this . 
Their marketing is slightly different . 
The name might not be much different , but the imagery sure is . 
Some brands are aspirational , and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative . 
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who 's the audience . 
And for donor agencies , unfortunately , the audience tends to be people that are n't even in the country they 're working [ in ] . 
It 's people back home , people that support their work , people like these . 
But if what we 're really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV , we need to think about the customer , the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples , the young women , the young men -- whose lives depend on it . 
And so the lesson is this : it does n't really matter what you 're selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior . 
It might just save their lives . 
Thank you .

Talking at the US State Department this summer , Hans Rosling uses his fascinating data - bubble software to burst myths about the developing world . Look for new analysis on China and the post - bailout world , mixed with classic data shows .

Hans Rosling : Let my dataset change your mindset 
I 'm going to talk about your mindset . 
Does your mindset correspond to my dataset ? 
If not , one or the other needs upgrading , is n't it ? 
When I talk to my students about global issues , and I listen to them in the coffee break , they always talk about " we " and " them . " 
And when they come back into the lecture room I ask them , " What do you mean with " we " and " them " ? 
" Oh , it 's very easy . It 's the western world and it 's the developing world , " they say . 
" We learned it in college . " 
And what is the definition then ? " The definition ? 
Everyone knows , " they say . 
But then you know , I press them like this . 
So one girl said , very cleverly , " It 's very easy . 
Western world is a long life in a small family . 
Developing world is a short life in a large family . " 
And I like that definition , because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset . 
And here you have the dataset . 
So , you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family . One , two , three , four , five children per woman on this axis . 
And here , length of life , life expectancy , 30 , 40 , 50 . 
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world . 
And really this is about the bedroom . 
Whether the man and woman decide to have small family , and take care of their kids , and how long they will live . 
It 's about the bathroom and the kitchen . If you have soap , water and food , you know , you can live long . 
And the students were right . It was n't that the world consisted -- the world consisted here , of one set of countries over here , which had large families and short life . Developing world . 
And we had one set of countries up there which was the western world . 
They had small families and long life . 
And you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime . 
Then the developing countries applied soap and water , vaccination . 
And all the developing world started to apply family planning . 
And partly to USA who help to provide technical advice and investment . 
And you see all the world moves over to a two child family , and a life with 60 to 70 years . 
But some countries remain back in this area here . 
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here . 
We have Liberia . We have Congo . 
So we have countries living there . 
So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born . 
And we , in fact , when we have played this over the world . 
I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week , and I could see the wrong concept even active people in United States had , that they did n't realize the improvement of Mexico there , and China , in relation to United States . 
Look here when I move them forward . 
Here we go . 
They catch up . There 's Mexico . 
It 's on par with United States in these two social dimensions . 
There was less than five percent of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this . 
This great nation , Mexico , has the problem that arms are coming from North , across the borders , so they had to stop that , because they have this strange relationship to the United States , you know . 
But if I would change this axis here , I would instead put income per person . 
Income per person . I can put that here . 
And we will then see a completely different picture . 
By the way , I 'm teaching you how to use our website , Gapminder World , while I 'm correcting this , because this is a free utility on the net . 
And when I now finally got it right , I can go back 200 years in history . 
And I can find United States up there . 
And I can let the other countries be shown . 
And now I have income per person on this axis . 
And United States only had some , one , two thousand dollars at that time . 
And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years , on par with Afghanistan today . 
And what has happened in the world , I will show now . 
This is instead of studying history for one year at university . 
You can watch me for one minute now and you 'll see the whole thing . 
You can see how the brown bubbles , which is west Europe , and the yellow one , which is the United States , they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier . 
And this is now 100 years ago , where the rest of the world remains behind . 
Here we come . And that was the influenza . 
That 's why we are so scared about flu , is n't it ? 
It 's still remembered . The fall of life expectancy . 
And then we come up . Not until independence started . 
Look here You have China over there , you have India over there , and this is what has happened . 
Did you note there , that we have Mexico up there ? 
Mexico is not at all on par with the United States , but they are quite close . 
And especially , it 's interesting to see China and the United States during 200 years , because I have my oldest son now working for Google , after Google acquired this software . 
Because in fact , this is child labor . My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this . 
And my youngest son , who studied Chinese in Beijing . 
So they come in with the two perspectives I have , you know ? 
And my son , youngest son who studied in Beijing , in China , he got a long - term perspective . 
Whereas when my oldest son , who works for Google , he should develop by quarter , or by half - year . 
Or Google is quite generous , so he can have one or two years to go . 
But in China they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period , for 100 years , when they went backwards . 
And then they would remember the first part of last century , which was really bad , and we could go by this so - called Great Leap Forward . 
But this was 1963 . 
Mao Tse - Tung eventually brought health to China , and then he died , and then Deng Xiaoping started this amazing move forward . 
Is n't it strange to see that the United States first grew the economy , and then gradually got rich ? 
Whereas China could get healthy much earlier , because they applied the knowledge of education , nutrition , and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning . 
And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development . 
So to me , as a public health professor , it 's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now . 
Because what you see here , what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman , is n't it . 
It 's not really , really flat . 
But the middle income countries -- and this is where I suggest to my students , stop using the concept " developing world . " 
Because after all , talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the United States . 
The last chapter is about present , and president Obama , and the other is about the past , where you cover everything from Washington to Eisenhower . 
Because Washington to Eisenhower , that is what we find in the developing world . 
We could actually go to Mayflower to Eisenhower , and that would be put together into a developing world , which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way , which have great entrepreneurs , but also have the collapsing countries . 
So , how could we make better sense about this ? 
Well , one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution . 
This is the income distribution of peoples in the world , from $ 1 . This is where you have food to eat . 
These people go to bed hungry . 
And this is the number of people . 
This is $ 10 , whether you have a public or a private health service system . This is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children , and this is OECD countries : Green , Latin America , East Europe . 
This is East Asia , and the light blue there is South Asia . 
And this is how the world changed . 
It changed like this . 
Can you see how it 's growing ? And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia ? 
And it goes over here ? 
And I come now , into projections , but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there , you know , because -- that 's where the projections are not valid any longer . 
Probably the world will do this . 
and then it will continue forward like this . 
But more or less , this is what will happen , and we have a world which can not be looked upon as divided . 
We have the high income countries here , with the United States as a leading power ; we have the emerging economies in the middle , which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout ; and we have the low income countries here . 
Yeah , this is a fact that from where the money comes , they have been saving , you know , over the last decade . 
And here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are . 
And here we have the countries in collapse and war , like Afghanistan , Somalia , parts of Congo , Darfur . 
We have all this at the same time . 
That 's why it 's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world . 
Because it 's so different , what has happened there . 
And that 's why I suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it . 
And you have huge differences within countries also . 
I heard that your departments here were by regions . 
Here you have Sub - Saharan Africa , South Asia , East Asia , Arab states , East Europe , Latin America , and OECD . 
And on this axis , GDP . 
And on this , heath , child survival , and it does n't come as a surprise that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom . 
But when I split it , when I split it into country bubbles , the size of the bubbles here is the population . 
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius , completely different . 
There is such a difference within Sub - Saharan Africa . 
And I can split the others . Here is the South Asian , Arab world . 
Now all your different departments . 
East Europe , Latin America , and OECD countries . 
And here were are . We have a continuum in the world . 
We can not put it into two parts . 
It is Mayflower down here . It is Washington here , building , building countries . 
It 's Lincoln here , advancing them . 
It 's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries . 
And then it 's United States today , up here . 
And we have countries all this way . 
Now , this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed . 
At this point I decided to make a pause . 
And it is my task , on behalf of the rest of the world , to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers , for Demographic Health Survey . 
Many are not aware of -- no , this is not a joke . 
This is very serious . 
It is due to USA 's continuous sponsoring during 25 years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what 's happening in the world . 
And it is U.S. government at its best , without advocacy , providing facts , that it 's useful for the society . 
And providing data free of charge on the internet , for the world to use . Thank you very much . 
Quite the opposite of the World Bank , who compiled data with government money , tax money , and then they sell it to add a little profit , in a very inefficient , Gutenberg way . 
But the people doing that at the World Bank are among the best in the world . 
And they are highly skilled professionals . 
It 's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way , as we do . 
And when it comes to free data and transparency , United States of America is one of the best . 
And that does n't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor . 
And I 'm not paid to come here , no . 
I would like to show you what happens with the data , what we can show with this data . 
Look here . This is the world . 
With income down there and child mortality . 
And what has happened in the world ? 
Since 1950 , during the last 50 years we have had a fall in child mortality . 
And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this . 
And we had an increase in income . 
And the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world . 
We have a continuum . But we still have , of course , Congo , up there . We still have as poor countries as we have had , always , in history . 
And that 's the bottom billion , where we 've heard today about a completely new approach to do it . 
And how fast has this happened ? 
Well , MDG 4 . 
The United States has not been so eager to use MDG 4 . 
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it , because it 's the only child mortality that we can measure . 
And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year . 
Let 's see what Sweden has done . 
We used to boast about fast social progress . 
That 's where we were , 1900 . 
1900 , Sweden was there . 
Same child mortality as Bangladesh had , 1990 , though they had lower income . 
They started very well . They used the aid well . 
They vaccinated the kids . They get better water . 
And they reduced child mortality , with an amazing 4.7 percent per year . They beat Sweden . 
I run Sweden the same 16 year period . 
Second round , it 's Sweden , 1916 , against Egypt , 1990 . 
Here we go . Once again the USA is part of the reason here . 
They get safe water , they get food for the poor , and they get malaria eradicated . 
5.5 percent . They are faster than the millennium development goal . 
And third chance for Sweden , against Brazil here . 
Brazil here has amazing social improvement over the last 16 years , and they go faster than Sweden . 
This means that the world is converging . 
The middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are catching up . 
They are moving to cities , where they also get better assistance for that . 
Well the Swedish students protest at this point . 
They say , " This is not fair , because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for Sweden . 
We have to do real - time competition . " 
Okay . I give you Singapore , the year I was born . 
Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden . 
It 's the most tropical country in the world , a marshland on the equator . 
And here we go . It took a little time for them to get independent . 
But then they started to grow their economy . 
And they made the social investment . They got away malaria . 
They got a magnificent health system that beat both the U.S. and Sweden . 
We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden ! 
All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals . 
These yellow are just about to be doing this . 
These red are the countries that does n't do it , and the policy has to be improved . 
Not simplistic extrapolation . 
We have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way . 
We have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing . 
And we have to fact - base the whole way we look at the world . 
This is dollar per person . This is HIV in the countries . 
The blue is Africa . 
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected . 
You see the tragedy in South Africa there . 
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected . 
And in spite of them having quite a high income , they have a huge number of HIV infected . 
But you also see that there are African countries down here . 
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa . 
There 's a number , five to 10 countries in Africa that has the same level as Sweden and United States . 
And there are others who are extremely high . 
And I will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries , with the most vibrant economy in Africa and a good governance , Botswana . 
They have a very high level . It 's coming down . 
But now it 's not falling , because there , with help from PEPFAR , it 's working with treatment . And people are not dying . 
And you can see it 's not that easy , that it is war which caused this . 
Because here , in Congo , there is war . 
And here , in Zambia , there is peace . 
And it 's not the economy . Richer country has a little higher . 
If I split Tanzania in its income , the richer 20 percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one . 
And it 's really different within each country . 
Look at the provinces of Kenya . They are very different . 
And this is the situation you see . 
It 's not deep poverty . It 's the special situation , probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries , or some parts of countries , in south and eastern Africa . 
Do n't make it Africa . Do n't make it a race issue . 
Make it a local issue . And do prevention at each place , in the way it can be done there . 
So to just end up , there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest , which we do n't know . 
Those who live beyond the cellphone , those who have yet to see a computer , those who have no electricity at home . 
This is the disease , Konzo , I spent 20 years elucidating in Africa . 
It 's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation . 
It 's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the ' 30s . 
It 's similar to other nutritional diseases . 
It will never affect a rich person . 
We have seen it here in Mozambique . 
This is the epidemic in Mozambique . This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania . 
You never heard about the disease . 
But it 's much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease . 
Cause crippling throughout the world . 
And over the last two years , 2,000 people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region . 
That used to be the illegal diamond trade , from the UNITA - dominated area in Angola . 
That has now disappeared , and they are now in great economic problem . 
And one week ago , for the first time , there were four lines on the Internet . 
Do n't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries . 
There is still mystery in one billion . 
And we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world . 
We need a new mindset . The world is converging , but -- but -- but not the bottom billion . 
They are still as poor as they 've ever been . 
It 's not sustainable , and it will not happen around one superpower . 
But you will remain one of the most important superpowers , and the most hopeful superpower , for the time to be . 
And this institution will have a very crucial role , not for United States , but for the world . 
So you have a very bad name , State Department . This is not the State Department . 
It 's the World Department . 
And we have a high hope in you . Thank you very much .

Robert Wright on optimism 
I 've got apparently 18 minutes to convince you that history has a direction , an arrow ; that in some fundamental sense , it 's good ; that the arrow points to something positive . 
Now , when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk -- -- that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting . 
It was before the avian flu had reached Europe . 
It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election , eliciting various counter - measures by Israel . 
And to be honest , if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk that even as I was giving the upbeat talk , the apocalypse would be unfolding -- -- I might have said , " Is it okay if I talk about something else ? " 
But I did n't , OK . So we 're here . I 'll do what I can . I 'll do what I can . 
I 've got to warn you : the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle , sometimes even elusive . 
The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring -- I mean , there 's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension to the way I try to uplift , so if grim inspiration -- -- if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms , that is , I 'm afraid , the most you can hope for . OK , today -- that 's if I succeed . 
I 'll see what I can do . OK ? 
Now , in one sense , the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial . 
If you 're just talking about social structure , OK , clearly that 's gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels . 
And in fact , that 's actually sustaining a long - standing trend that predates human beings , OK , that biological evolution was doing for us . 
Because what happened in the beginning , this stuff encases itself in a cell , then cells start hanging out together in societies . 
Eventually they get so close , they form multicellular organisms , then you get complex multicellular organisms ; they form societies . 
But then at some point , one of these multicellular organisms does something completely amazing with this stuff , which is it launches a whole second kind of evolution : cultural evolution . 
And amazingly , that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity . 
By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas . 
A lot of you have heard the term " memes . " The evolution of technology , I pay a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things you got was a little hand axe . 
Generations go by , somebody says , hey , why do n't we put it on a stick ? 
Just absolutely delights the little ones . 
Next best thing to a video game . 
This may not seem to impress , but technological evolution is progressive , so another 10 , 20,000 years , and armaments technology takes you here . 
Impressive . And the rate of technological evolution speeds up , so a mere quarter of a century after this , you get this , OK . 
And this . 
I 'm sorry -- it was a cheap laugh , but I wanted to find a way to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse , and I thought that might do it . 
So , what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse is the collapse of global social organization . 
Now , first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are , to be on the brink of true global social organization . 
Originally , you had the most complex societies , the hunter - gatherer village . 
Stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom , which is what you get with the invention of agriculture : multi - village polity with centralized rule . 
With the invention of writing , you start getting cities . This is blurry . I kind of like that because it makes it look like a one - celled organism and reminds you how many levels organic organization has already moved through to get to this point . And then you get to , you know , you get empires . 
I want to stress , you know , social organization can transcend political bounds . 
This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire . 
So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent , even if no polity did similarly . Today , you 've got nation states . 
Point is : there 's obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bounds . 
This is actually just a picture of the earth at night , and I 'm just putting it up because I think it 's pretty . 
Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system . 
Now , I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something called " non - zero sumness . " 
Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading , very quickly , the key idea is the distinction between zero - sum games , in which correlations are inverse : always a winner and a loser . 
Non - zero - sum games in which correlations can be positive , OK . 
So like in tennis , usually it 's win - lose ; it always adds up to zero - zero - sum . But if you 're playing doubles , the person on your side of the net , they 're in the same boat as you , so you 're playing a non - zero - sum game with them . 
It 's either for the better or for the worse , OK . 
A lot of forms of non - zero - sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation . 
The argument I make is basically that , well , non - zero - sum games have always been part of life . 
You have them in hunter - gatherer societies , but then through technological evolution , new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non - zero - sum games , involving more people over larger territory . 
Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential , so you get cities , you know , and you get all the non - zero - sum games you do n't think about that are being played across the world . 
Like , have you ever thought when you buy a car , how many people on how many different continents contributed to the manufacture of that car ? Those are people in effect you 're playing a non - zero - sum game with . 
I mean , there are certainly plenty of them around . 
Now , this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way , because when you think of non - zero , you think win - win , you know , that 's good . Well , there are a few reasons that actually it 's not intrinsically upbeat . 
First of all , it can accommodate ; it does n't deny the existence of inequality exploitation war . 
But there 's a more fundamental reason that it 's not intrinsically upbeat , because a non - zero - sum game , all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse . 
It does n't necessarily predict a win - win outcome . 
So , in a way , the question is : on what grounds am I upbeat at all about history ? And the answer is , first of all , on balance I would say people have played their games to more win - win outcomes than lose - lose outcomes . On balance , I think history is a net positive in the non - zero - sum game department . 
And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me , most impresses me , and most uplifts me , which is that there is a moral dimension to history ; there is a moral arrow . We have seen moral progress over time . 
2,500 years ago , members of one Greek city - state considered members of another Greek city - state subhuman and treated them that way . And then this moral revolution arrived , and they decided that actually , no , Greeks are human beings . 
It 's just the Persians who are n't fully human and do n't deserve to be treated very nicely . 
But this was progress -- you know , give them credit . And now today , we 've seen more progress . I think -- I hope -- most people here would say that all people everywhere are human beings , deserve to be treated decently , unless they do something horrendous , regardless of race or religion . 
And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been , OK . This was not a prevalent view , few thousand years ago , and I attribute it to this non - zero - sum dynamic . 
I think that 's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities , ethnicities , religions as there is today . If you asked me , you know , why am I not in favor of bombing Japan , well , I 'm only half - joking when I say they built my car . 
We have this non - zero - sum relationship , and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize that someone else 's welfare is positively correlated with yours -- you 're more likely to cut them a break . 
I kind of think this is a kind of a business - class morality . 
Unfortunately , I do n't fly trans - Atlantic business class often enough to know , or any other kind of business class really , but I assume that in business class , you do n't hear many expressions of , you know , bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups , because the people who are flying trans - Atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they 're making money off all these people . And I really do think that , in that sense at least , capitalism has been a constructive force , and more fundamentally , it 's a non - zero - sumness that has been a constructive force in expanding people 's realm of moral awareness . I think the non - zero - sum dynamic , which is not only economic by any means -- it 's not always commerce -- but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth , which is the fundamental equality of everyone . It has done that . 
As it has moved global , moved us toward a global level of social organization , it has driven us toward moral truth . 
I think that 's wonderful . 
Now , back to the unfolding apocalypse . 
And you may wonder , OK , that 's all fine , sounds great -- moral direction in history -- but what about this so - called clash of civilizations ? Well , first of all , I would emphasize that it fits into the non - zero - sum framework , OK . If you look at the relationship between the so - called Muslim world and Western world -- two terms I do n't like , but ca n't really avoid ; in such a short span of time , they 're efficient if nothing else -- it is non - zero - sum . And by that I mean , if people in the Muslim world get more hateful , more resentful , less happy with their place in the world , it 'll be bad for the West . If they get more happy , it 'll be good for the West . 
So that is a non - zero - sum dynamic . 
And I would say the non - zero - sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time because of technological trends , but more intense in a kind of negative way . 
It 's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible . 
And one reason is because of something I call the " growing lethality of hatred . " 
More and more , it 's possible for grassroots hatred abroad to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil . 
And that 's pretty new , and I think it 's probably going to get a lot worse -- this capacity -- because of trends in information technology , in technologies that can be used for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology . 
We may be hearing more about that today . 
And there 's something I worry about especially , which is that this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope . 
What I have in mind is : terrorism happens here ; we overreact to it . 
That , you know , we 're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation leads to more hatred abroad , more terrorism . 
We overreact because being human , we feel like retaliating , and it gets worse and worse and worse . 
You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes , but I think in something so spooky , we really should n't have the word positive there at all , even in a technical sense . 
So let 's call it the death spiral of negativity . 
I assure you if it happens , at the end , both the West and the Muslim world will have suffered . 
So , what do we do ? Well , first of all , we can do a lot more with arms control , the international regulation of dangerous technologies . 
I have a whole global governance sermon that I will spare you right now , because I do n't think that 's going to be enough anyway , although it 's essential . 
I think we 're going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world . 
I think you 're just going to have to see less hatred among groups , less bigotry , and , you know , racial groups , religious groups , whatever . 
I 've got to admit I feel silly saying that . 
It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish . I feel like Rodney King , you know , saying , why ca n't we all just get along ? 
But hey , I do n't really see any alternative , given the way I read the situation . 
There 's going to have to be moral progress . 
There 's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world , given how dangerous it 's becoming . 
In my defense , I 'd say , as naive as this may sound , it 's ultimately grounded in cynicism . 
That is to say -- -- thank you , thank you . That is to say , remember : my whole view of morality is that it boils down to self - interest . 
It 's when people 's fortunes are correlated . 
It 's when your welfare conduces to mine , that I decide , oh yeah , I 'm all in favor of your welfare . That 's what 's responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far , and I 'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes , and if people respond to it intelligently , we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need , you know . 
We will see the further evolution of this kind of business - class morality . 
So , these two things , you know , if they get people 's attention and drive home the positive correlation and people do what 's in their self - interests , which is further the moral evolution , then they could actually have a constructive effect . 
And that 's why I lump growing lethality of hatred and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric , reasons to be cheerful . 
Doing the best I can , OK . 
I never called myself Mr. Uplift . 
I 'm just doing what I can here . 
Now , launching a moral revolution has got to be hard , right ? 
I mean , what do you do ? 
And I think the answer is a lot of different people are going to have to do a lot of different things . 
We all start where we are . Speaking as an American who has children whose security 10 , 20 , 30 years down the road I worry about -- what I personally want to start out doing is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us , OK . 
I think that 's a worthy research project myself . 
I also like it because it 's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise . 
Because to understand why somebody in a very different culture does something -- somebody you 're kind of viewing as alien , who 's doing things you consider strange in a culture you consider strange -- to really understand why they do the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment , because you 've got to relate their experience to yours . 
To really understand it , you 've got to say , " Oh , I get it . 
So when they feel resentful , it 's kind of like the way I feel resentful when this happens , and for somewhat the same reasons . " That 's true understanding . 
And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that . 
It 's especially hard to do when people hate you , OK , because you do n't really , in a sense , want to completely understand why people hate you . 
I mean , you want to hear the reason , but you do n't want to be able to relate to it . 
You do n't want it to make sense , right ? 
You do n't want to say , " Well , yeah , I can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country I live in . " That 's not a pleasant thing , but I think it 's something that we 're going to have to get used to and work on . Now , I want to stress that to understand , you know -- there are people who do n't like this whole business of understanding the grassroots , the root causes of things ; they do n't want to know why people hate us . I want to understand it . 
The reason you 're trying to understand why they hate us , is to get them to quit hating us . The idea when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate their humanity and better understand them , is part of an effort to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run . 
I think it 's the first step toward that . That 's the long - term goal . 
There are people who worry about this , and in fact , I , myself , apparently , was denounced on national TV a couple of nights ago because of an op - ed I 'd written . 
It was kind of along these lines , and the allegation was that I have , quote , " affection for terrorists . " 
Now , the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter . 
I mean , if you 've got to have an enemy , do make it Ann Coulter . 
But it 's not a crazy concern , OK , because understanding behavior can lead to a kind of empathy , and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love , and so on . 
But I think we 're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending the situation clearly enough , than in comprehending it so clearly that we just ca n't , you know , get the army out to kill terrorists . 
So I 'm not really worried about it . So -- -- I mean , we 're going to have to work on a lot of fronts , but if we succeed -- if we succeed -- then once again , non - zero - sumness and the recognition of non - zero - sum dynamics will have forced us to a higher moral level . 
And a kind of saving higher moral level , something that kind of literally saves the world . 
If you look at the word " salvation " in the Bible -- the Christian usage that we 're familiar with -- saving souls , that people go to heaven -- that 's actually a latecomer . 
The original meaning of the word " salvation " in the Bible is about saving the social system . 
" Yahweh is our Savior " means " He has saved the nation of Israel , " which at the time , was a pretty high - level social organization . 
Now , social organization has reached the global level , and I guess , if there 's good news I can say I 'm bringing you , it 's just that all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit of self - interests in a disciplined and careful way . 
It 's going to be hard . I say we give it a shot anyway because we 've just come too far to screw it up now . 
Thanks .

Martin Seligman on positive psychology 
When I was president of the American Psychological Association , they tried to media - train me , and an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I 'm going to be talking about today , which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic . 
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them , I 'm going to give you the eleventh . 
So they came to me -- CNN -- and they said , " Professor Seligman , would you tell us about the state of psychology today ? 
We 'd like to interview you about that . " And I said , " Great . " 
And she said , " But this is CNN , so you only get a sound bite . " 
So I said , " Well , how many words do I get ? " 
And she said , " Well , one . " 
And cameras rolled , and she said , " Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? " 
" Good . " 
" Cut . Cut . That wo n't do . 
We 'd really better give you a longer sound bite . " 
" Well , how many words do I get this time ? " " I think , well , you get two . 
Doctor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? " 
" Not good . " 
" Look , Doctor Seligman , we can see you 're really not comfortable in this medium . 
We 'd better give you a real sound bite . 
This time you can have three words . 
Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? " 
" Not good enough . " And that 's what I 'm going to be talking about . 
I want to say why psychology was good , why it was not good and how it may become , in the next 10 years , good enough . 
And by parallel summary , I want to say the same thing about technology , about entertainment and design , because I think the issues are very similar . 
So , why was psychology good ? 
Well , for more than 60 years , psychology worked within the disease model . 
Ten years ago , when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate , and told them what I did , they 'd move away from me . 
And because , quite rightly , they were saying psychology is about finding what 's wrong with you . Spot the loony . 
And now , when I tell people what I do , they move toward me . 
And what was good about psychology , about the 30 billion dollar investment NIMH made , about working in the disease model , about what you mean by psychology , is that , 60 years ago , none of the disorders were treatable -- it was entirely smoke and mirrors . 
And now , 14 of the disorders are treatable , two of them actually curable . 
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed , a science of mental illness . 
That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -- like depression , alcoholism -- and measure them with rigor . 
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses . 
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses . 
We could look across time at the same people -- people , for example , who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -- and ask what the contribution of mothering , of genetics are , and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses . 
And best of all , we were able , in the last 50 years , to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments . 
And then we were able to test them rigorously , in random assignment , placebo controlled designs , throw out the things that did n't work , keep the things that actively did . 
And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry , over the last 60 years , can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable . 
And I think that 's terrific . I 'm proud of it . 
But what was not good , the consequences of that were three things . 
The first was moral , that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists , pathologizers , that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble , bricks fell on you . 
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions . 
We forgot responsibility . That was the first cost . 
The second cost was that we forgot about you people . 
We forgot about improving normal lives . 
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier , more fulfilled , more productive . And " genius , " " high - talent , " became a dirty word . 
No one works on that . 
And the third problem about the disease model is , in our rush to do something about people in trouble , in our rush to do something about repairing damage , it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier , positive interventions . 
So that was not good . 
And so , that 's what led people like Nancy Etcoff , Dan Gilbert , Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology , which has three aims . 
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness . 
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage . 
It should be interested in the best things in life . 
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling , and with genius , with nurturing high talent . 
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we 've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living . 
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness . 
And any of you , for free , can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness . 
You can ask , how do you stack up for positive emotion , for meaning , for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ? 
We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities : a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio , how they 're defined , how to diagnose them , what builds them and what gets in their way . 
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states , the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness . 
I 've spent my life working on extremely miserable people , and I 've asked the question , how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you ? 
And starting about six years ago , we asked about extremely happy people . 
And how do they differ from the rest of us ? 
And it turns out there 's one way . 
They 're not more religious , they 're not in better shape , they do n't have more money , they 're not better looking , they do n't have more good events and fewer bad events . 
The one way in which they differ : they 're extremely social . 
They do n't sit in seminars on Saturday morning . 
They do n't spend time alone . 
Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends . 
But watch out here . This is merely correlational data , not causal , and it 's about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I 'm going to talk about : happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer . 
And I 'm going to suggest to you that 's not nearly enough , in just a moment . 
We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries , from the Buddha to Tony Robbins . 
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy . 
And we find that we 've been able to manualize many of them , and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies . 
That is , which ones actually make people lastingly happier ? 
In a couple of minutes , I 'll tell you about some of those results . 
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have , in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill , and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable , is can psychology actually make people happier ? 
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much -- we 've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy . 
And I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them , it 's possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives . 
The first happy life is the pleasant life . 
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can , and the skills to amplify it . 
The second is a life of engagement -- a life in your work , your parenting , your love , your leisure , time stops for you . 
That 's what Aristotle was talking about . 
And third , the meaningful life . 
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them . 
The first life is the pleasant life and it 's simply , as best we can find it , it 's having as many of the pleasures as you can , as much positive emotion as you can , and learning the skills -- savoring , mindfulness -- that amplify them , that stretch them over time and space . 
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks , and it 's why positive psychology is not happy - ology and why it does n't end here . 
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life , your experience of positive emotion , is heritable , about 50 percent heritable , and , in fact , not very modifiable . 
So the different tricks that Matthieu [ Ricard ] and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks , getting more of it . 
Second is that positive emotion habituates . It habituates rapidly , indeed . 
It 's all like French vanilla ice cream , the first taste is a 100 percent ; by the time you 're down to the sixth taste , it 's gone . 
And , as I said , it 's not particularly malleable . 
And this leads to the second life . 
And I have to tell you about my friend , Len , to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion , more than building pleasure . 
In two of the three great arenas of life , by the time Len was 30 , Len was enormously successful . The first arena was work . 
By the time he was 20 , he was an options trader . 
By the time he was 25 , he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company . 
Second , in play -- he 's a national champion bridge player . 
But in the third great arena of life , love , Len is an abysmal failure . 
And the reason he was , was that Len is a cold fish . 
Len is an introvert . 
American women said to Len , when he dated them , " You 're no fun . You do n't have positive emotion . Get lost . " 
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst , who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him . 
But it turned out there was n't any sexual trauma . 
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football , and played bridge -- Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities . 
The question is , is Len unhappy ? And I want to say not . 
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity , I think Len is one of the happiest people I know . 
He 's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that 's because Len , like most of you , is enormously capable of flow . 
When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9:30 in the morning , time stops for him . And it stops till the closing bell . 
When the first card is played , until 10 days later , the tournament is over , time stops for Len . 
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about , about flow . And it 's distinct from pleasure in a very important way . 
Pleasure has raw feels : you know it 's happening . It 's thought and feeling . 
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow , you ca n't feel anything . 
You 're one with the music . Time stops . 
You have intense concentration . 
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life . 
And we think there 's a recipe for it , and it 's knowing what your highest strengths are . 
And again , there 's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are . 
And then re - crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can . 
Re - crafting your work , your love , your play , your friendship , your parenting . 
Just one example . One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi 's . 
Hated the job . 
She 's working her way through college . 
Her highest strength was social intelligence , so she re - crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer 's day . 
Now obviously she failed . 
But what she did was to take her highest strengths , and re - craft work to use them as much as possible . 
What you get out of that is not smiley - ness . 
You do n't look like Debbie Reynolds . 
You do n't giggle a lot . What you get is more absorption . 
So , that 's the second path . The first path , positive emotion . 
The second path is eudaimonian flow . 
And the third path is meaning . 
This is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally . 
And meaning , in this view , consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia -- it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are , and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are . 
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives , the pleasant life , the good life , the meaningful life , people are now hard at work on the question , are there things that lastingly change those lives ? 
And the answer seems to be yes . And I 'll just give you some samples of it . 
It 's being done in a rigorous manner . 
It 's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works . 
So we do random assignment , placebo controlled , long - term studies of different interventions . 
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect , when we teach people about the pleasant life , how to have more pleasure in your life , one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills , the savoring skills , and you 're assigned to design a beautiful day . 
Next Saturday , set a day aside , design yourself a beautiful day , and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures . 
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced . 
Gratitude visit . I want you all to do this with me now , if you would . 
Close your eyes . 
I 'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction , and who you never properly thanked . 
The person has to be alive . OK . 
Now , OK , you can open your eyes . 
I hope all of you have such a person . 
Your assignment , when you 're learning the gratitude visit , is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person , call them on the phone in Phoenix , ask if you can visit , do n't tell them why , show up at their door , you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens . 
And what happens is when we test people one week later , a month later , three months later , they 're both happier and less depressed . 
Another example is a strength date , in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test , and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths , and we find this is a strengthener of relationships . 
And fun versus philanthropy . 
But it 's so heartening to be in a group like this , in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy . 
Well , my undergraduates and the people I work with have n't discovered this , so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun , and to contrast it . 
And what you find is when you do something fun , it has a square wave walk set . 
When you do something philanthropic to help another person , it lasts and it lasts . 
So those are examples of positive interventions . 
So , the next to last thing I want to say is we 're interested in how much life satisfaction people have . 
And this is really what you 're about . And that 's our target variable . 
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives , how much life satisfaction do you get ? 
So we ask -- and we 've done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people -- to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure , the pursuit of positive emotion , the pleasant life , the pursuit of engagement , time stopping for you , and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction ? 
And our results surprised us , but they were backward of what we thought . 
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction . 
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest . 
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong . 
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning , then pleasure 's the whipped cream and the cherry . 
Which is to say , the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts , if you 've got all three . 
Conversely , if you have none of the three , the empty life , the sum is less than the parts . 
And what we 're asking now is does the very same relationship , physical health , morbidity , how long you live and productivity , follow the same relationship ? 
That is , in a corporation , is productivity a function of positive emotion , engagement and meaning ? 
Is health a function of positive engagement , of pleasure , and of meaning in life ? 
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes . 
So , Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard , and so this was amazing for me . I 've never been in a gathering like this . 
I 've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much , which was one of the remarkable things . 
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology , entertainment and design in the following way . 
We all know that technology , entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes . 
We also know that technology , entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery . 
And by the way , the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important . 
I thought , when I first became a therapist 30 years ago , that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed , not anxious , not angry , that I 'd make them happy . 
And I never found that . I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero . 
But they were empty . 
And it turns out the skills of happiness , the skills of the pleasant life , the skills of engagement , the skills of meaning , are different from the skills of relieving misery . 
And so , the parallel thing holds with technology , entertainment and design , I believe . 
That is , it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness , to increase positive emotion , and that 's typically how they 've been used . 
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do -- not just positive emotion , that 's not nearly enough -- there 's flow in life , and there 's meaning in life . 
As Laura Lee told us , design , and , I believe , entertainment and technology , can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well . 
So in conclusion , the eleventh reason for optimism , in addition to the space elevator , is that I think with technology , entertainment and design , we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet . 
And if technology can , in the next decade or two , increase the pleasant life , the good life and the meaningful life , it will be good enough . 
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion , meaning , eudaimonia , it will be good enough . 
And if design can increase positive emotion , eudaimonia , and flow and meaning , what we 're all doing together will become good enough . Thank you . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_mwenda_takes_a_new_look_at_africa.html 
In this provocative talk , journalist Andrew Mwenda asks us to reframe the " African question " -- to look beyond the media 's stories of poverty , civil war and helplessness and see the opportunities for creating wealth and happiness throughout the continent . 
Africa , business , development , global issues , investment , philanthropy , politics , technology

Andrew Mwenda takes a new look at Africa 
I am very , very happy to be amidst some of the most -- the lights are really disturbing my eyes and they 're reflecting on my glasses . 
I am very happy and honored to be amidst very , very innovative and intelligent people . 
I have listened to the three previous speakers , and guess what happened ? 
Every single thing I planned to say , they have said it here , and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say . 
But there is a saying in my culture that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something , that bud is a young one . 
So , I will -- since I am not young and am very old , I still will say something . 
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment , because another conference is taking place in Berlin . 
It is the G8 Summit . 
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa 's problems should be a massive increase in aid , something akin to the Marshall Plan . 
Unfortunately , I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan . 
One , because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated . 
Its largest recipients were Germany and France , and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP . 
An average African country receives foreign aid to the tune of 13 , 15 percent of its GDP , and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources from rich countries to poor countries . 
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect . 
How the media covers Africa in the West , and the consequences of that . 
By displaying despair , helplessness and hopelessness , the media is telling the truth about Africa , and nothing but the truth . 
However , the media is not telling us the whole truth . 
Because despair , civil war , hunger and famine , although they 're part and parcel of our African reality , they are not the only reality . 
And secondly , they are the smallest reality . 
Africa has 53 nations . 
We have civil wars only in six countries , which means that the media are covering only six countries . 
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate through the web of despair and helplessness that the Western media largely presents to its audience . 
But the effect of that presentation is , it appeals to sympathy . 
It appeals to pity . It appeals to something called charity . 
And , as a consequence , the Western view of Africa 's economic dilemma is framed wrongly . 
The wrong framing is a product of thinking that Africa is a place of despair . 
What should we do with it ? We should give food to the hungry . 
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill . 
We should send peacekeeping troops to serve those who are facing a civil war . 
And in the process , Africa has been stripped of self - initiative . 
I want to say that it is important to recognize that Africa has fundamental weaknesses . 
But equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential . 
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa , from a challenge of despair , which is called poverty reduction , to a challenge of hope . 
We frame it as a challenge of hope , and that is worth creation . 
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa is not the challenge of reducing poverty . 
It should be a challenge of creating wealth . 
Once we change those two things -- if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction , you have the international cartel of good intentions moving onto the continent , with what ? 
Medicines for the poor , food relief for those who are hungry , and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war . 
And in the process , none of these things really are productive because you are treating the symptoms , not the causes of Africa 's fundamental problems . 
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines , ladies and gentlemen , does not create wealth for them . 
Wealth is a function of income , and income comes from you finding a profitable trading opportunity or a well - paying job . 
Now , once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa , our second challenge will be , who are the wealth - creating agents in any society ? 
They are entrepreneurs . [ Unclear ] told us they are always about four percent of the population , but 16 percent are imitators . 
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship . 
So , where should we be putting the money ? 
We need to put money where it can productively grow . 
Support private investment in Africa , both domestic and foreign . 
Support research institutions , because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation . 
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today ? 
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health , for primary education , for food relief . 
The entire continent has been turned into a place of despair , in need of charity . 
Ladies and gentlemen , can any one of you tell me a neighbor , a friend , a relative that you know , who became rich by receiving charity ? 
By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms ? 
Does any one of you in the audience have that person ? 
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of the generosity and kindness of another ? 
Well , since I 'm not seeing the hand , it appears that what I 'm stating is true . 
Andrew Mwenda : I can see Bono says he knows the country . 
Which country is that ? 
AM : Thank you very much . But let me tell you this . 
External actors can only present to you an opportunity . 
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage depends on your internal capacity . 
Africa has received many opportunities . 
Many of them we have n't benefited much . 
Why ? Because we lack the internal , institutional framework and policy framework that can make it possible for us to benefit from our external relations . I 'll give you an example . 
Under the Cotonou Agreement , formerly known as the Lome Convention , African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe to export goods , duty - free , to the European Union market . 
My own country , Uganda , has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons of sugar to the European Union market . 
We have n't exported one kilogram yet . 
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba . 
Secondly , under the beef protocol of that agreement , African countries that produce beef have quotas to export beef duty - free to the European Union market . 
None of those countries , including Africa 's most successful nation , Botswana , has ever met its quota . 
So , I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa 's inability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework . 
And all forms of intervention need support , the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth , the kinds of institutions that increase productivity . 
How do we begin to do that , and why is aid the bad instrument ? 
Aid is the bad instrument , and do you know why ? 
Because all governments across the world need money to survive . 
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order . 
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order . 
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial , they need really to have the army clobber the opposition . 
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers - on . 
Why should people support their government ? 
Well , because it gives them good , paying jobs , or , in many African countries , unofficial opportunities to profit from corruption . 
The fact is no government in the world , with the exception of a few , like that of Idi Amin , can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule . 
Many countries in the [ unclear ] , they need legitimacy . 
To get legitimacy , governments often need to deliver things like primary education , primary health , roads , build hospitals and clinics . 
If the government 's fiscal survival depends on it having to raise money from its own people , such a government is driven by self - interest to govern in a more enlightened fashion . 
It will sit with those who create wealth . 
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business so that it can collect more tax revenues from them . 
The problem with the African continent and the problem with the aid industry is that it has distorted the structure of incentives facing the governments in Africa . 
The productive margin in our governments ' search for revenue does not lie in the domestic economy , it lies with international donors . 
Rather than sit with Ugandan -- -- rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs , Ghanaian businessmen , South African enterprising leaders , our governments find it more productive to talk to the IMF and the World Bank . 
I can tell you , even if you have ten Ph . Ds . , you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry . 
Why ? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand the incentives necessary to expand a business -- it requires that you listen to the people , the private sector actors in that industry . 
Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity , by the international community , to avoid building productive arrangements with your own citizens , and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank , and then it is the IMF and the World Bank that tell them what its citizens need . 
In the process , we , the African people , have been sidelined from the policy - making , policy - orientation , and policy- implementation process in our countries . 
We have limited input , because he who pays the piper calls the tune . 
The IMF , the World Bank , and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens , and therefore what our governments are doing , because they depend on aid , is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens . 
But I want to put a caveat on my argument , and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive . 
Some aid may have built a hospital , fed a hungry village . 
It may have built a road , and that road may have served a very good role . 
The mistake of the international aid industry is to pick these isolated incidents of success , generalize them , pour billions and trillions of dollars into them , and then spread them across the whole world , ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village , the skills , the practices , the norms and habits that allowed that small aid project to succeed -- like in Sauri village , in Kenya , where Jeffrey Sachs is working -- and therefore generalize this experience as the experience of everybody . 
Aid increases the resources available to governments , and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing you can have , as a person in Africa seeking a career . 
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state , especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa , aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state in order to get access to the foreign aid pie . 
Ladies and gentlemen , the most enterprising people in Africa can not find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business . 
Governments are not changing it . Why ? 
Because they do n't need to talk to their own citizens . 
They talk to international donors . 
So , the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government , and that has increased the political tensions in our countries precisely because we depend on aid . 
I also want to say that it is important for us to note that , over the last 50 years , Africa has been receiving increasing aid from the international community , in the form of technical assistance , and financial aid , and all other forms of aid . 
Between 1960 and 2003 , our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid , and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa . 
Where has all the aid gone ? 
I want to use the example of my own country , called Uganda , and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there . 
In the 2006 - 2007 budget , expected revenue : 2.5 trillion shillings . 
The expected foreign aid : 1.9 trillion . 
Uganda 's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean ? 
Hand - to - mouth is 2.6 trillion . 
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent of its own revenue ? 
It 's because there 's somebody there called foreign aid , who contributes for it . 
But this shows you that the government of Uganda is not committed to spending its own revenue to invest in productive investments , but rather it devotes this revenue to paying structure of public expenditure . 
Public administration , which is largely patronage , takes 690 billion . 
The military , 380 billion . 
Agriculture , which employs 18 percent of our poverty - stricken citizens , takes only 18 billion . 
Trade and industry takes 43 billion . 
And let me show you , what does public expenditure -- rather , public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute ? 
There you go . 70 cabinet ministers , 114 presidential advisers , by the way , who never see the president , except on television . 
And when they see him physically , it is at public functions like this , and even there , it is him who advises them . 
We have 81 units of local government . 
Each local government is organized like the central government -- a bureaucracy , a cabinet , a parliament , and so many jobs for the political hangers - on . 
There were 56 , and when our president wanted to amend the constitution and remove term limits , he had to create 25 new districts , and now there are 81 . 
Three hundred thirty - three members of parliament . 
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament . 
One hundred thirty - four commissions and semi - autonomous government bodies , all of which have directors and the cars . And the final thing , this is addressed to Mr. Bono . In his work , he may help us on this . 
A recent government of Uganda study found that there are 3,000 four - wheel drive motor vehicles at the Minister of Health headquarters . 
Uganda has 961 sub - counties , each of them with a dispensary , none of which has an ambulance . 
So , the four - wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters drive the ministers , the permanent secretaries , the bureaucrats and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects , while the poor die without ambulances and medicine . 
Finally , I want to say that before I came to speak here , I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt . 
It should be short enough to arouse interest , but long enough to cover the subject . 
I hope I have achieved that . 
Thank you very much .

David Griffin on how photography connects us 
Let 's just start by looking at some great photographs . 
This is an icon of National Geographic , an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry . 
But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out with a parody of National Geographic , and I shudder to think what they 're going to do to this photograph . 
Oh , the wrath of Photoshop . 
This is a jet landing at San Francisco , by Bruce Dale . 
He mounted a camera on the tail . 
A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy , by Sam Abell . 
Pygmies in the DRC , by Randy Olson . 
I love this photograph because it reminds me of Degas ' bronze sculptures of the little dancer . 
A polar bear swimming in the Arctic , by Paul Nicklen . 
Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth -- they 're not very good swimmers -- and we know what 's happening to the ice . 
These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa , photographed by Chris Johns . 
Shot straight down , so these are the shadows of the camels . 
This is a rancher in Texas , by William Albert Allard , a great portraitist . 
And Jane Goodall , making her own special connection , photographed by Nick Nichols . 
This is a soap disco in Spain , photographed by David Alan Harvey . 
And David said that there was lot of weird stuff happening on the dance floor . 
But , hey , at least it 's hygienic . 
These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance , by David Doubilet . 
And this is a comet , captured by Dr. Euan Mason . 
And finally , the bow of the Titanic , without movie stars , photographed by Emory Kristof . 
Photography carries a power that holds up under the relentless swirl of today 's saturated , media world , because photographs emulate the way that our mind freezes a significant moment . 
Here 's an example . 
Four years ago , I was at the beach with my son , and he was learning how to swim in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches . 
But I turned away for a moment , and he got caught into a riptide and started to be pulled out towards the jetty . 
I can stand here right now and see , as I go tearing into the water after him , the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement . 
I can see the rocks are over here . 
There 's a wave about to crash onto him . 
I can see his hands reaching out , and I can see his face in terror , looking at me , saying , " Help me , Dad . " 
I got him . The wave broke over us . 
We got back on shore ; he was fine . 
We were a little bit rattled . 
But this flashbulb memory , as it 's called , is when all the elements came together to define not just the event , but my emotional connection to it . 
And this is what a photograph taps into when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer . 
Now I have to tell you , I was talking to Kyle last week about this , that I was going to tell this story . 
And he said , " Oh , yeah , I remember that too ! 
I remember my image of you was that you were up on the shore yelling at me . " 
I thought I was a hero . 
So , this represents -- this is a cross - sample of some remarkable images taken by some of the world 's greatest photojournalists , working at the very top of their craft -- except one . 
This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason in New Zealand last year , and it was submitted and published in National Geographic . 
Last year , we added a section to our website called " Your Shot , " where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication . 
And it has become a wild success , tapping into the enthusiast photography community . 
The quality of these amateur photographs can , at times , be amazing . 
And seeing this reinforces , for me , that every one of us has at least one or two great photographs in them . 
But to be a great photojournalist , you have to have more than just one or two great photographs in you . 
You 've got to be able to make them all the time . 
But even more importantly , you need to know how to create a visual narrative . 
You need to know how to tell a story . 
So I 'm going to share with you some coverages that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography . 
Photographer Nick Nichols went to document a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary in Chad , called Zakouma . 
The original intent was to travel there and bring back a classic story of diverse species , of an exotic locale . 
And that is what Nick did , up to a point . 
This is a serval cat . 
He 's actually taking his own picture , shot with what 's called a camera trap . 
There 's an infrared beam that 's going across , and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph . 
These are baboons at a watering hole . 
Nick -- the camera , again , an automatic camera took thousands of pictures of this . 
And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures of the rear ends of baboons . 
A lion having a late night snack -- notice he 's got a broken tooth . 
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den . 
I love this little bit of water that comes off the back of his tail . 
But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants . 
It 's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa . 
Here 's a photograph shot in moonlight , something that digital photography has made a big difference for . 
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted . 
Nick , along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay , collared the matriarch of the herd . 
They named her Annie , and they began tracking her movements . 
The herd was safe within the confines of the park , because of this dedicated group of park rangers . 
But once the annual rains began , the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park . 
And that 's when they ran into trouble . 
For outside the safety of the park were poachers , who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks . 
The matriarch that they were radio tracking , after weeks of moving back and forth , in and out of the park , came to a halt outside the park . 
Annie had been killed , along with 20 members of her herd . 
And they only came for the ivory . 
This is actually one of the rangers . 
They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory , because they could n't leave it there , because it 's still valuable . 
But what Nick did was he brought back a story that went beyond the old - school method of just straight , " Is n't this an amazing world ? " 
And instead , created a story that touched our audiences deeply . 
Instead of just knowledge of this park , he created an understanding and an empathy for the elephants , the rangers and the many issues surrounding human - wildlife conflicts . 
Now let 's go over to India . 
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way . 
We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman touches upon in his new world population project . 
For the first time in history , more people live in urban , rather than rural , environments . 
And most of that growth is not in the cities , but in the slums that surround them . 
Jonas Bendiksen , a very energetic photographer , came to me and said , " We need to document this , and here 's my proposal . 
Let 's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world . " 
And I said , " Well , you know , that might be a bit ambitious for our budget . " 
So instead , what we did was we decided to , instead of going out and doing what would result in what we 'd consider sort of a survey story -- where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything -- we put Jonas into Dharavi , which is part of Mumbai , India , and let him stay there , and really get into the heart and soul of this really major part of the city . 
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look at the awful conditions that exist in such places . 
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part of how the entire urban area functioned . 
By staying tightly focused in one place , Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit that underlies this community . 
And he did it in a beautiful way . 
Sometimes , though , the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture . 
We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry and photojournalist Randy Olson to document the depletion of the world 's fisheries . 
We were n't the only ones to tackle this subject , but the photographs that Brian and Randy created are among the best to capture both the human and natural devastation of overfishing . 
Here , in a photo by Brian , a seemingly crucified shark is caught up in a gill net off of Baja . 
I 've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch , the animals accidentally scooped up while fishing for a specific species . 
But here , Brian captured a unique view by positioning himself underneath the boat when they threw the waste overboard . 
And Brian then went on to even greater risk to get this never - before - made photograph of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom . 
Back on land , Randy Olson photographed a makeshift fish market in Africa , where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals , the main parts having already been sent to Europe . 
And here in China , Randy shot a jellyfish market . 
As prime food sources are depleted , the harvest goes deeper into the oceans and brings in more such sources of protein . 
This is called fishing down the food chain . 
But there are also glimmers of hope , and I think anytime we 're doing a big , big story on this , we do n't really want to go and just look at all the problems . 
We also want to look for solutions . 
Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand , where commercial fishing had been banned -- the result being that the overfished species have been restored , and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries . 
Photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial . 
James Nachtwey , who was honored at last year 's TED , took a look at the sweep of the medical system that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq . 
It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end and exits back home , on the other . 
Jim started in the battlefield . 
Here , a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital . 
Here is in the field hospital . 
The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter tattooed across his chest , as a reminder of home . 
From here , the more severely wounded are transported back to Germany , where they meet up with their families for the first time . 
And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans ' hospitals , such as here in Walter Reed . 
And finally , often fitted with high - tech prosthesis , they exit the medical system and attempt to regain their pre - war lives . 
Jim took what could have been a straight - up medical science story and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply . 
Now , these stories are great examples of how photography can be used to address some of our most important topics . 
But there are also times when photographers simply encounter things that are , when it comes down to it , just plain fun . 
Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica to shoot a story on leopard seals . 
They have been rarely photographed , partly because they are considered one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean . 
In fact , a year earlier , a researcher had been grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed . 
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant about getting into the water . 
Now , what leopard seals do mostly is , they eat penguins . 
You know of " The March of the Penguins . " 
This is sort of the munch of the penguins . 
Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out to see if the coast is clear . 
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out . 
But then Paul got in the water . 
And he said he was never really afraid of this . 
Well , this one female came up to him . 
She 's probably -- it 's a shame you ca n't see it in the photograph , but she 's 12 feet long . 
So , she is pretty significant in size . 
And Paul said he was never really afraid , because she was more curious about him than threatened . 
This mouthing behavior , on the right , was really her way of saying to him , " Hey , look how big I am ! " 
Or you know , " My , what big teeth you have . " 
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him . 
To her , here was this big , goofy creature in the water that for some reason did n't seem to be interested in chasing penguins . 
So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him , alive , and put them in front of him . 
She dropped them off , and then they would swim away . 
She 'd kind of look at him , like " What are you doing ? " 
Go back and get them , and then bring them back and drop them in front of him . 
And she did this over the course of a couple of days , until the point where she got so frustrated with him that she started putting them directly on top of his head . 
Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph . 
Eventually , though , Paul thinks that she just figured that he was never going to survive . 
This is her just puffing out , you know , snorting out in disgust . 
And lost interest with him , and went back to what she does best . 
Paul set out to photograph a relatively mysterious and unknown creature , and came back with not just a collection of photographs , but an amazing experience and a great story . 
It is these kinds of stories , ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial that demonstrate the power of photojournalism . 
I believe that photography can make a real connection to people , and can be employed as a positive agent for understanding the challenges and opportunities facing our world today . 
Thank you .

At TEDxUSC , computer graphics trailblazer Paul Debevec explains the scene - stealing technology behind Digital Emily , a digitally constructed human face so realistic it stands up to multiple takes .

Paul Debevec animates a photo - real digital face 
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics has been being able to create a photo - real , digital human face . 
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that , unlike aliens and dinosaurs , we look at human faces every day . 
They are very important to how we communicate with each other . 
As a result , we 're tuned in to the subtlest things that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering , in order to believe whether these things are realistic . 
And what I 'm going to do in the next five minutes is take you through a process where we tried to create a reasonably photo - realistic computer - generated face , using some computer graphics technology we 've developed , and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics . 
And we 're going to try to do a photo - real face of an actress named Emily O'Brien , who is right there . 
And that 's actually a completely computer - generated rendering of her face . 
By the end of the talk , we 're going to see it move . 
The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself , who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in Marina Del Rey , and sit for a session in Light Stage 5 . 
This is a face - scanning sphere , with 156 white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions . 
And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this . 
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds . 
And we basically capture enough information with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face , and different principle directions of light from the light stage , to figure out both the coarse - scale and the fine - scale detail of her face . 
If we zoom in on this photograph right here , we can see it 's a really nice photograph to have of her , because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time to get a nice image of her facial texture . 
And in addition , we 've actually used polarizers on all the lights -- just like polarized sunglasses can block the glare off of the road , polarizers can block the shine off of the skin , so we do n't get all those specular reflections to take this map . 
Now , if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit , we can actually bring that specular reflection of the skin back in , and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point . 
If you take the difference between these two images here , you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of Emily 's skin . 
I do n't think any photograph like this had ever been taken before we had done this . 
And this is very important light to capture , because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin . 
It does n't get underneath the translucent layers of the skin and blur out . 
And , as a result , it 's a very good cue to the detailed shape of the skin - pore structure and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have , the things that actually make us look like real humans . 
So , if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape , and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles . 
And , even more importantly , since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot Emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions . 
So , here you can see her moving her eyes around , moving her mouth around . 
And these we 're actually going to use to create a photo - real digital character . 
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily , you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things as it goes into different facial expressions . 
You can see things . Not only the face shape changes , but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs . 
You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously from stretched skin pores to the regular skin texture . 
You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there . 
You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down . 
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that . 
In addition to this kind of high - resolution geometry , since it 's all captured with cameras , we 've got a great texture map to use for the face . 
And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination , the red and the green and the blue , diffuse the light differently , we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer . 
Then , instead of looking like a plaster mannequin , it actually looks like it 's made out of living human flesh . 
And this is what we used to give to the company Image Metrics to create a rigged , digital version of Emily . 
We 're just seeing the coarse - scale geometry here . 
But they basically created a digital puppet of her , where you can pull on these various strings , and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took . 
And , in addition to the coarse - scale geometry , they also used all of that detail to create a set of what are called " displacement maps " that animate as well . 
These are the displacement maps here . 
And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates . 
So the next process was then to animate her . 
We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data . 
So , by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques , they were able to drive the facial rig with the computer - generated performance . 
So what you 're going to see now , after this , is a completely photo - real digital face . 
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that 's available . 
Emily : Image Metrics is a markerless , performance - driven animation company . 
We specialize in high - quality facial animation for video games and films . 
Image Metrics is a markerless , performance - driven animation company . 
We specialize in high quality facial animation for video games and films . 
Paul Debevec : So , if we break that down into layers , here 's that diffuse component we saw in the first slide . 
Here is the specular component animating . 
You can see all the wrinkles happening there . 
And there is the underlying wireframe mesh . 
And that is Emily herself . 
Now , where are we going with this here ? 
We 've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5 . This is Light Stage 6 , and we 're looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies . 
This is Bruce Lawmen , one of our researchers in the group , who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage . 
And let 's take a look at a computer - generated version of Bruce , running in a new environment . 
And thank you very much .

Botanist Corneille Ewango talks about his work at the Okapi Faunal Reserve in the Congo Basin -- and his heroic work protecting it from poachers , miners and raging civil wars .

Corneille Ewango is a hero of the Congo forest 
I do n't speak English . 
I start speaking English , learning English , about a year ago . 
I speak French and I grew up with French , so my English is Franglais . 
I 'm born in the Western Congo , in an area around here , and then went to university in Kisangani . 
And after I finished , I went to this area , the Ituri Forest . 
But what I 've been doing -- when I was about 14 , I grew in my uncle 's house . 
And my father was a soldier , and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher . 
What I 've been doing from 14 to 17 was , I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk , meat and whatever they were killing , poaching , hunting in the forest , bring it in the main city to get access to the market . 
But finally , I got myself involved . 
Around 17 to 20 years , I became , myself , a poacher . 
And I wanted to do it , because -- I believed -- to continue my studies . 
I wanted to go to university , but my father was poor , my uncle even . 
So , I did it . 
And for three to four years , I went to university . 
For three times , I applied to biomedical science , to be a doctor . 
I did n't succeed . 
I was having my inscriptions , my admission to biology . 
And I said , " No way , I 'm not doing it . 
My family 's poor , my area do n't have better health care . 
I want to be a doctor to serve them . " 
Three times , that means three years , and I start getting old . 
I say , " Oh , no , I continue . " 
So , I did tropical ecology and plant botany . 
When I finished , I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship . 
It 's where I really getting passion with what I 'm doing right up to now -- I 'm standing in front of you -- doing botany and wildlife conservation . 
That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve with some animals and also plants . 
And the training center there was built around the scientific Congolese staff and some American scientists also . 
So , the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number -- I think that is the largest number of elephants we have right now in protected areas in Congo . 
It has also chimpanzees . 
And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve because of this beautiful creature . 
That is a forest giraffe . 
I think you guys know it quite well . 
Here we have savanna giraffes , but through evolution we have this forest giraffe that lives only in Congo . 
It has also some beautiful primates . 
Thirteen species -- highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa . 
And it has the Ituri Forest itself -- about 1,300 species of plants , so far known . 
I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society , working there , in 1995 , but I started working with them as a student in 1991 . 
I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university because I accomplished with honor . 
But I did n't like the way -- the instruction I got was very poor . 
And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center . 
With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko , that most of you know , life became very , very difficult . 
And the work we have been doing was completely difficult to do and to achieve it . 
When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo , so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated . 
So they started fleeing from the east to the west . 
And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there , so there was a road from Goma , somewhere here , and coming like this . 
So they might go through , pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve . 
Congo has five of the world 's richest sites of protected area , and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them . 
So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve . 
On their way , they looted everything . 
Torture , wars -- oh , my God , you ca n't believe . 
Every person was looking his way -- where to go , we do n't know . 
And it was for us , the young , the first time really we hear the language of war , of guns . 
And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963 , after our independence , they did n't believe what was happening . 
They were killing people . They were doing whatever they want because they have power . 
Who have been doing that ? 
Young children . Child soldiers . 
You ca n't ask him how old he is because he has guns . 
But I was from the west , working in the east . 
I even [ at ] that time was not speaking Swahili . 
And when they came , they looted everything . 
You ca n't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu , and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier . 
And I was from the same area to him . 
All my friends said , we are leaving because we are a target . 
But I 'm not going to the east , because I do n't know Swahili . 
I stay . If I go , I will be killed . 
I ca n't go back to my area -- it 's more than 1,000 kilometers [ away ] . 
I stayed after they looted everything . 
We have been doing research on botany , and we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants . 
We cut , we dry and we packed them , we mounted them on a folder . 
Purpose : so that we start them for agriculture , for medicine , for whatever , and for science , for the study of the flora and the change of the forest . 
That is people moving around , that 's even Pygmies . 
And this is a bright guy , hard - working person , and Pygmy . 
I 've been working with him about 10 years . 
And with soldiers , they went to the forest for poaching elephants . 
Because he 's Pygmy , he knows how to track elephants in the forest . 
He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest . 
They came to told me , I have to save him . 
And what I did , I gave him just antibiotics that we care for tuberculosis . 
And fortunately , I saved his life . 
And that was the language of the war . 
Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral , killing animals , the logging timbers and so on . 
And what of important things -- I think all of you here have a cell phone . 
That mineral has killed a lot : five millions of Congolese have gone because of this Colombo - Tantalite -- they call it Coltan -- that they use it to make cell phones and it has been in that area , all over in Congo . Extraction , and good , big business of the war . 
And what I did for the first war , after we have lost everything , I have to save something , even myself , my life and life of the staff . 
I buried some of our new vehicle engines , I buried it to save it . 
And some of equipment went with them , on the top of the canopy , to save it . 
He 's not collecting plants , he 's going to save our equipment on the canopy . 
And with the material that 's left -- because they wanted to destroy it , to burn it , they did n't understand it , they did n't go to school -- I packed it . 
And that is me , going to , hurrying to Uganda , to try to save that 4,000 material , with people carrying them on the bikes , bicycles . 
And after that , we succeeded . 
I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University . 
And after the war , I have been able to bring it back home , so that we continue our studies . 
The second war came while we did n't expect it . 
With friends , we had been sitting and watching match football , and having some good music with WorldSpace radio , when it started , I think . 
So , it was so bad . 
We heard that now from the east again the war started , and it 's going fast . 
This time I think Kabila will go in place of , as he did with Mobutu . 
And the reserve was a target to the rebels . 
Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area and competing for natural resources . 
And there was no way to work . 
They destroy everything . 
Poaching -- oh , no way . 
And that 's the powerful men . We have to meet and to talk to them . 
What 's the regulation of the reserve and what is the regulation of the parks ? 
And they ca n't do what they are doing . 
So we went to meet them . 
That is Coltan extraction , gold mining . 
So , we started talking with them , convincing them that we are in a protected area . 
There are regulations that it 's prohibited to do logging , mining and poaching , specifically . 
But they said , " You guys , you think that soldiers who are dying are not important , and your animals you are protecting are most important . 
We do n't think so . 
We have to do it , because to let our movement advance . " 
I say , " No way , you are not going to do it here . " 
We started talking with them and I was negotiating . 
Tried to protect our equipment , tried to protect our staff and the villages of about 1,500 people . 
And we continued . 
But I was doing that , negotiating with them . 
Sometimes we are having meeting and they are talking with Jean - Pierre Bemba , Sometimes , they talk to my own language , that is , Lingala . 
I hear it and what strategy they are doing , what they are planning . 
Sometimes , they are having a helicopter to supply them with ammunition and so on . 
They used me to carry that , and I was doing counting , what comes from where , and where , and where . 
I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone , my computer and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest . 
And every time , daily , after we have meeting , what compromise we have , whatever , I go , I write a short email , send it . 
I do n't know how many people I had on my address . 
I sent the message : what is going about the progress of the war and what they are planning to do . 
They started suspecting that what we do on the morning , and the afternoon , it 's on the news , BBC , RFI . 
Something might be going on . 
And one day , we went for a meeting . 
Sorry . 
One day , we went to meet the Chief Commander . 
He had the same iridium cell phone like me . 
And he asked me , " Do you know how to use this ? " 
I said , " I have never seen it . 
I do n't know . " 
And I had mine on my pocket . 
So , it was a chance that they trusted me a lot . 
They did n't -- they was not looking on me . 
So I was scared . 
And when we finished the meeting , I went to return it in the forest . 
And I was sending news , doing whatever , reporting daily to the U.N. , to UNESCO , to our institution in New York , what have been going . 
And for that , they have been having big pressure to leave , to free the area . 
Because there was no way -- whatever they do , it 's known the same time . 
During the first two rebellions , they killed all animals in the zoo . 
We have a zoo of 14 Okapis , and one of them was pregnant . 
And during the war , after a week of heavy war , fighting in the area , we succeeded : we had the first Okapi . 
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this . 
This is not local population , this is rebels . 
They are now happy sending the news that they have protected the Okapi with the war , because we sent the news that they are killing and poaching everywhere . 
After a week , we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi , they killed an elephant , just 50 meters to the area where the zoo , where Okapi was born . 
And I was mad . 
I oppose it -- that they are now going to dissect it , until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander . 
And I succeeded . 
The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks . 
What we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war -- we have to rebuild . 
I had some money . I was paid 150 dollars . 
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium , because we did n't have good infrastructure to start plants . 
Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants . 
I started this with 70 dollars , and start fundraising money to where I 've been going . 
I had opportunity to go all over , where herbarium for my African material is . 
And they supported me a bit , and I built this . 
Now , it 's doing work to train young Congolese . 
And also , what one of the speciality we are doing , my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity , and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon . 
This is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot , where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters , and we are tracking them . 
We have now data of about 15 years , to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions . 
And that is -- I think it 's difficult for me . 
This is a very embarrassing talk , I know . 
I do n't know where to start , where to finish it . 
When I was thinking to come here , what best title I wanted to say to my talk , I did n't find this . 
But now I think that I would have titled it , " The Language of Guns . " 
Where are you people ? 
Now we are talking about reconstitution , rebuild Africa . 
But is gun industries a tool to rebuild , or is it a game ? 
I think we see the war like a game -- like soccer , football . 
Everybody is happy , but see what it 's doing , see what is going in Darfur . 
Now we say , oh , my God . 
See what the wars in Rwanda . 
That 's because of the language of guns . 
I do n't think that someone may blame Google , because it 's doing the right things , even if people like Al - Qaeda are using Google to connect between them . 
But it 's serving millions for the best . 
But what is doing with gun industries ? 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you , thank you . 
Just wait over there . 
It 's an amazing story . 
I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have . 
How can we help you ? 
Corneille Ewango : That 's really embarrassing questions . 
I think that now I feel nervous . 
And I think , helping us , people are acting sometimes by ignorance . 
I did it myself . 
If I know when I was young , that [ by ] killing an elephant , I 'm destroying biodiversity , I would not have done it . 
Many , many of you have seen the talents of Africans , but there are few who are going to school . 
Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics , HIV , malaria , poverty , not going to school . 
What you can assist us , it 's by building capacities . 
How many have got opportunity like me to go to U.S. , do a master 's ? 
And go -- now , I 'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D. 
But many of them are just here , because they do n't have money . 
And they ca n't go even to university . 
They ca n't even attain the bachelor 's degree . 
Building capacities for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for Africa . 
CA : Thank you , thank you .

Bill Stone : Exploring deep caves 
First place I 'd like to take you is what many believe will be the world 's deepest natural abyss . 
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing . 
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I 'll talk a little bit about . 
One of the things that 's changed here , in the last 150 years since Jules Verne had great science - fiction concepts of what the underworld was like , is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about . 
We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity . 
Along the way we 've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight . 
When you go on a thing like this , we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months , with a team as small as 20 or 30 , to as big as 150 . 
And a lot of people ask me , you know , what kind of people do you get for a project like this ? 
While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA , it 's nonetheless thorough . 
We 're looking for competence , discipline , endurance , and strength . 
In case you 're wondering , this is our strength test . 
But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter - personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations . 
We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance . 
From the entrance , this is nothing like a commercial cave . 
You 're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2 , not K2 , but J2 . 
We 're roughly two days from the entrance at that point . 
And it 's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse , except that you 're now running a string of these things down . 
The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you 're down there , otherwise in damp , moist , cold conditions in utterly dark places . 
I should mention that everything you 're seeing here , by the way , is artificially illuminated at great effort . 
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places . 
The deeper you go , the more you run into a conflict with water . 
It 's basically like a tree collecting water coming down . 
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just do n't do justice . 
So I 've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s . 
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico . 
Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous . 
We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film . 
Along that same line , I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year , we have never seen monsters underground -- at least the kind that eat you . 
If there is a monster underground , it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance . 
Next year I 'll be leading an international team to J2 . 
We 're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters -- that 's a little over 8,600 feet down -- at 30 kilometers from the entrance . 
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight . 
I do n't think there 's been a mission like that in a long time . 
Eventually , if you keep going down in these things , probability says that you 're going to run into a place like this . 
It 's a place where there 's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof . 
And when you used to find these things , they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon . 
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons . 
Number one , it 's the name of my rock band , and second , is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor . 
And we 've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this . 
This is some life - support equipment closed - cycle . 
And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater . 
When you do this kind of stuff it 's like doing EVA . 
It 's like doing extra - vehicular activity in space , but at much greater distances , and at much greater physical peril . 
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range , away from a safe haven . 
Here 's a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in 1999 . 
Narrator : Exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before . 
This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet . 
To experience it is a privilege . 
Bill Stone : That was taken in Wakulla Springs , Florida . 
Couple of things to note about that movie . Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before 1999 . 
It was developed within a two - year period and used on actual exploratory projects . 
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper , and it produced the first three - dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave , and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs . 
It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world . 
This is Europa . 
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day . 
This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there . 
For those who have never seen this story , Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago , called " Aliens of the Deep . " 
There was a brief clip -- Narrator : A mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge . 
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light , it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle . 
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice . 
Now we have to get through the ice . 
You need a melt probe . 
It 's basically a nuclear - heated torpedo . 
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep . 
Week after week , the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice , until finally -- Now , what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean ? 
You need an AUV , an autonomous underwater vehicle . 
It needs to be one smart puppy , able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean . 
BS : What Jim did n't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV . 
I mean , I cut through three years of engineering meetings , design and system integration , and introduced DEPTHX -- Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer . 
And as the movie says , this is one smart puppy . 
It 's got 96 sensors , 36 onboard computers , 100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code , packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent . 
This is the target site , the world 's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico . 
It 's been explored to a depth of 292 meters and beyond that nobody knows anything . 
This is part of DEPTHX 's mission . 
There are two primary targets we 're doing here . 
One is , how do you do science autonomy underground ? 
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist ? 
There are more stages involved here than I 've got time to tell you about , but basically we drive through the space , we populate it with environmental variables -- sulphide , halide , things like that . 
We calculate gradient surfaces , and drive the bot over to a wall where there 's a high probability of life . 
We move along the wall , in what 's called proximity operations , looking for changes in color . 
If we see something that looks interesting , we pull it into a microscope . 
If it passes the microscopic test , we go for a collection . 
We either draw in a liquid sample , or we can actually take a solid core from the wall . 
No hands at the wheel . 
This is all behavioral autonomy here that 's being conducted by the robot on its own . 
The real hat trick for this vehicle , though , is a disruptive new navigation system we 've developed , known as 3D SLAM , for simultaneous localization and mapping . 
DEPTHX is an all - seeing eyeball . 
Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time , allowing it to do new exploration while it 's still achieving geometric sensor - lock on what it 's gone through already . 
What I 'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that 's ever been done . 
This May , we 're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton , and if we 're very lucky , DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically - discovered division of bacteria . 
The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then , if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go , we could potentially launch by 2016 , and by 2019 we may have the first evidence of life off this planet . 
What then of manned space exploration ? 
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024 . 
The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots . 
It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago . 
Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime . 
What I 'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas . 
And I hope you 'll bear with me and have some faith that there 's credibility behind what we 're going to say here . 
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately . 
One of them is the requirement for economical earth - to - space transport . 
The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them . 
Go , go , go . 
The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit . 
Orbital hotels to start with , but workshops for the rest of us later on . 
The final missing piece , the real paradigm - buster , is this : a gas station on orbit . 
It 's not going to look like that . 
If it existed , it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning . 
Now , to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement , I 've got to give you the basics of Space 101 . 
And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram . 
Anybody drink one of these here this week ? 
You 'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit . 
That 's more than you pay for TED , if Google dropped their sponsorship . 
The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant . 
Thus , every time you 'd want to do anything in space , you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator . 
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics . 
So , what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price ? 
There is a place where you can . 
In fact , you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon . 
There is a little - known mission that was launched by the Pentagon , 13 years ago now , called Clementine . 
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon . 
That signal was so strong , it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the sediment , collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material . 
If we 're going to get that , and make that gas station possible , we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space . 
We ca n't do that right now . 
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground , and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces . 
We have to beat that . 
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics . 
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything . 
This is an idea that , again , came out of Livermore back in 1989 , with Dr. Lowell Wood 's group . 
And we can extend that now to just about everything . 
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit . 
We can go much further . 
We can build space tugs , orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water . 
There 's another thing . 
When you 're coming back from the moon , you have to deal with orbital mechanics . 
It says you 're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station . 
You got two choices . 
You can burn rocket fuel to get there , or you can do something really incredible . 
You can dive into the stratosphere , and precisely dissipate that velocity , and come back out to the space station . 
It has never been done . 
It 's risky and it 's going to be one hell of a ride -- better than Disney . 
The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency . 
If you try to do that for the moon , you 're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there . 
But if you send a mining team there , without the return propellant , first -- Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez ? 
This is not like that . I 'm much more like Scotty . 
I like this equipment , you know , and I really value it so we 're not going to burn the gear . 
But , if you were truly bold you could get it there , manufacture it , and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done . 
There 's a myth that you ca n't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years . 
That 's not true . 
In seven years , we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low - earth orbit . 
We 're living in one of the most exciting times in history . 
We 're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space . 
The orbital refueling stations I 've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration . 
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed . 
We can do it by jump - starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater , to mine the moon for resources , and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit . 
Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing . 
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED . 
I intend to lead that expedition . 
It can be done in seven years with the right backing . 
Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who , had they been here today , would have heartily approved . 
There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier . 
We have collectively forgotten that lesson . 
Now we 're at a time when boldness is required to move forward . 
100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words , I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier , in our time , for all of us . 
Thank you .

Amy Tan on creativity 
The Value of Nothing : Out of Nothing Comes Something . 
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B+ . 
What I 'm going to talk about : nothing out of something , and how we create . 
And I 'm gon na try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within , and to follow the TED commandments : that is , actually , something that creates a near - death experience , but near - death is good for creativity . 
OK . 
So , I also want to explain , because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie , or not true to universal creativity . 
And I 've done it this way for half the audience , who is scientific . 
When I say we , I do n't mean you , necessarily ; I mean me , and my right brain , my left brain and the one that 's in between that is the censor and tells me what I 'm saying is wrong . 
And I 'm going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process , which includes a number of things that happened , actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I 'm creating something new . 
And that includes nature , and nurture , and what I refer to as nightmares . 
Now in the nature area , we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something , perhaps in our brains , some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse - like effect . 
And some people would say that we 're born with it in some other means . 
And others , like my mother , would say that I get my material from past lives . 
Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of , you know , psychosis , or depression . 
I do have to say , somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh was n't really necessarily psychotic , that he might have had temporal lobe seizures , and that might have caused his spurt of creativity , and I do n't -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain . 
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago , but it was during the time I was writing my last book , and some people say that book is quite different . 
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis : you know , who am I , why am I this particular person , why am I not black like everybody else ? 
And sometimes you 're equipped with skills , but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity . 
I used to draw . I thought I would be an artist . 
And I had a miniature poodle . 
And it was n't bad , but it was n't really creative . 
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one - on - one way . 
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book . 
And then , I also was n't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be , and you know , you look at those scores , and it was n't bad , but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words . 
Also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma . 
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , I had expectations placed on me . 
That figure right there , by the way , figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old , and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age . 
I have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure . 
But actually , there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14 . 
And it was discovered that my brother , in 1967 , and then my father , six months later , had brain tumors . 
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong , and she was gon na find out what it was , and she was gon na fix it . 
My father was a Baptist minister , and he believed in miracles , and that God 's will would take care of that . 
But , of course , they ended up dying , six months apart . 
And after that , my mother believed that it was fate , or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened . 
Everything except randomness . She did not believe in randomness . 
There was a reason for everything . 
And one of the reasons , she thought , was that her mother , who had died when she was very young , was angry at her . 
And so , I had this notion of death all around me , because my mother also believed that I would be next , and she would be next . 
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon , you begin to think very much about everything . 
You become very creative , in a survival sense . 
And this , then , led to my big questions . 
And they 're the same ones that I have today . 
And they are : why do things happen , and how do things happen ? 
And the one my mother asked : how do I make things happen ? 
It 's a wonderful way to look at these questions , when you write a story . 
Because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . What are the influences ? 
How do I , as the narrator , as the writer , also influence that ? 
And it 's also one that , I think , many of our scientists have been asking . 
It 's a kind of cosmology , and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe , as the creator of that universe . 
And you see , there 's a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen , trying to figure it out -- years and years , oftentimes . 
So , when I look at creativity , I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life . 
And I got a lot of them during what 's been going on throughout this conference , almost everything that 's been going on . 
And so I 'm going to use , as the metaphor , this association : quantum mechanics , which I really do n't understand , but I 'm still gon na use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor . 
So , in quantum mechanics , of course , you have dark energy and dark matter . 
And it 's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen . 
There 's a lot of unknown , and you often do n't know what it is except by its absence . 
But when you make those associations , you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story , and what you 're finding is what matters . The meaning . 
And that 's what I look for in my work , a personal meaning . 
There is also the uncertainty principle , which is part of quantum mechanics , as I understand it . 
And this happens constantly in the writing . 
And there 's the terrible and dreaded observer effect , in which you 're looking for something , and you know , things are happening simultaneously , and you 're looking at it in a different way , and you 're trying to really look for the about - ness , or what is this story about . And if you try too hard , then you will only write the about . 
You wo n't discover anything . 
And what you were supposed to find , what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way , is no longer there . 
Now , I do n't want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe , like many of our scientists have . 
And so , I am going to just throw in string theory here , and just say that creative people are multidimensional , and there are 11 levels , I think , of anxiety . 
And they all operate at the same time . 
There is also a big question of ambiguity . 
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant . 
And you do n't know what is operating , but something is operating there . 
And ambiguity , to me , is very uncomfortable in my life , and I have it . Moral ambiguity . 
It is constantly there . And , just as an example , this is one that recently came to me . 
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . And she said , " Save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . " 
A very famous Chinese saying , she said . 
And that means because we went into Iraq , we should stay there until things were solved . You know , maybe even 100 years . 
So , there was another one that I came across , and it 's " saving fish from drowning . " 
And it 's what Buddhist fishermen say , because they 're not supposed to kill anything . 
And they also have to make a living , and people need to be fed . 
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning , and unfortunately , in the process the fish die . 
Now , what 's encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually , one of them is my mother 's interpretation , and it is a famous Chinese saying , because she said it to me : " save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . " 
And it was a warning -- do n't get involved in other people 's business , or you 're going to get stuck . 
OK . I think if somebody really was drowning , she 'd save them . 
But , both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning , or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions . 
And all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response . 
And then we have intentions . 
There 's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do , and then we do something . 
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been . 
Maybe things go wrong . And so , after that , what are our responsibilities ? 
What are we supposed to do ? 
Do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good , and therefore I can not be held responsible for all of it ? 
That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me , and led me to write a book called " Saving Fish From Drowning . " 
I saw examples of that . Once I identified this question , it was all over the place . 
I got these hints everywhere . 
And then , in a way , I knew that they had always been there . 
And then writing , that 's what happens . I get these hints , these clues , and I realize that they 've been obvious , and yet they have not been . 
And what I need , in effect , is a focus . 
And when I have the question , it is a focus . 
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question , and what happens is those particular things become relevant . 
And it seems like it 's happening all the time . 
You think there 's a sort of coincidence going on , a serendipity , in which you 're getting all this help from the universe . 
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus . 
And you are noticing it more often . 
But you apply this . 
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions . 
Your brother , who 's fallen in trouble , do you take care of him ? 
Why or why not ? 
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said , human rights in Burma . 
I was thinking that I should n't go because somebody said , if I did , it would show that I approved of the military regime there . 
And then , after a while , I had to ask myself , " Why do we take on knowledge , why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us ? " 
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up , and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father , who was a Baptist minister . 
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions , and still did n't know that if I went there , what the result of that would be , if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later , when the time came . 
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of . 
We come to this point and say , what do I as an individual do ? 
Not all of us can go to Africa , or work at hospitals , so what do we do , if we have this moral response , this feeling ? 
Also , I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at , and we talked about today , is genocide . 
This leads to this question . 
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable , and I consider what my intentions should be , I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here , and what is the meaning of my life , and what is my place in the universe ? 
It seems so obvious , and yet it is not . 
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense , and yet it is also absolutely necessary . 
In writing a story , it is the place where I begin . 
Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems . 
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book , because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know . 
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally , from an overdose of opium , while having too much of a good time , I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself , and that actually was the way it happened . 
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother . 
There are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book . 
In this case , I was writing a story that included some kind of detail , period of history , a certain location . 
And I needed to find something historically that would match that . 
And I took down this book , and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting , and the time period , and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion , happening in the area near Guilin , outside of that , and a character who thought he was the son of God . 
You wonder , are these things random chance ? 
Well , what is random ? What is chance ? What is luck ? 
What are things that you get from the universe that you ca n't really explain ? 
And that goes into the story , too . 
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day . 
Especially when good things happen , and , in particular , when bad things happen . 
But I do think there 's a kind of serendipity , and I do want to know what those elements are , so I can thank them , and also try to find them in my life . 
Because , again , I think that when I am aware of them , more of them happen . 
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends , and we drove randomly to a different place , and we ended up in this non - tourist location , a beautiful village , pristine . 
And we walked three valleys beyond , and the third valley , there was something quite mysterious and ominous , a discomfort I felt . And then I knew that had to be [ the ] setting of my book . 
And in writing one of the scenes , it happened in that third valley . 
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building . 
And I did n't know exactly why I had it , but it was so vivid . 
I got stuck , and a friend , when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs , that I said , sure . And about 45 minutes later , walking along the beach , I came across this . 
And it was a man , a Chinese man , and he was stacking these things , not with glue , not with anything . 
And I asked him , " How is it possible to do this ? " 
And he said , " Well , I guess with everything in life , there 's a place of balance . " 
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point . 
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this , when I 'm writing a story , and I can not explain it . 
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things ? 
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we can not explain , like the cosmological constant ? 
A big thing that I also think about is accidents . 
And as I said , my mother did not believe in randomness . 
What is the nature of accidents ? 
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ? 
I was able to see that in a firsthand way , when I went to beautiful Dong village , in Guizhou , the poorest province of China . 
And I saw this beautiful place . I knew I wanted to come back . 
And I had a chance to do that , when National Geographic asked me if I wanted to write anything about China . 
And I said yes , about this village of singing people , singing minority . 
And they agreed , and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went , there was a terrible accident . A man , an old man , fell asleep , and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm . 
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged . 
Responsibility was assigned to the family . 
The man 's sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cowshed . 
And , of course , as Westerners , we say , " Well , it was an accident . That 's not fair . 
It 's the son , not the father . " 
When I go on a story , I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs . 
It takes a while , but I have to let go of them and just go there , and be there . 
And so I was there on three occasions , different seasons . 
And I began to sense something different about the history , and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village , and what you find as your joys , and your rituals , your traditions , your links with other families . And I saw how this had a kind of justice , in its responsibility . 
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using , a ceremony they had n't used in about 29 years . And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses . 
Now you , as Westerners , and I , as Westerners , would say well , that 's superstition . But after being there for a while , and seeing the amazing things that happened , you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world , determining how things happen . 
So I remained with them , and the more I wrote that story , the more I got into those beliefs , and I think that 's important for me -- to take on the beliefs , because that is where the story is real , and that is where I 'm gon na find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life . 
Years go by , of course , and the writing , it does n't happen instantly , as I 'm trying to convey it to you here at TED . 
The book comes and it goes . When it arrives , it is no longer my book . 
It is in the hands of readers , and they interpret it differently . 
But I go back to this question of , how do I create something out of nothing ? 
And how do I create my own life ? 
And I think it is by questioning , and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths . 
I believe in specifics , the specifics of story , and the past , the specifics of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point . 
I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck , and fate , and coincidences and accidents , God 's will , and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is , how we create . 
I have to think of my role . Where I am in the universe , and did somebody intend for me to be that way , or is it just something I came up with ? 
And I also can find that by imagining fully , and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world , the fictional world . 
And that is how I find particles of truth , not the absolute truth , or the whole truth . 
And they have to be in all possibilities , including those I never considered before . 
So , there are never complete answers . 
Or rather , if there is an answer , it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything , and that is good , because then I will discover something new . 
And if there is a partial answer , a more complete answer from me , it is to simply imagine . 
And to imagine is to put myself in that story , until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating . 
And that 's how I 've discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest , I think , to knowing what compassion is , to feeling that compassion . 
Because for everything , in that question of how things happen , it has to do with the feeling . 
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that . 
We 've come to the end of the talk , and I will reveal what is in the bag , and it is the muse , and it is the things that transform in our lives , that are wonderful and stay with us . 
There she is . 
Thank you very much !

In a world of too many options and too little time , our obvious choice is to just ignore the ordinary stuff . Marketing guru Seth Godin spells out why , when it comes to getting our attention , bad or bizarre ideas are more successful than boring ones .

Seth Godin on standing out 
I 'm going to give you four specific examples -- and I 'm going to cover at the end -- about how a company called Silk tripled their sales by doing one thing , how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact , to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect . 
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years , a record label I started that had a CD called " Sauce . " 
Before I can do that I 've got to tell you about sliced bread , and a guy named Otto Rohwedder . 
Now , before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said ? 
Like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something . 
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread , and he focused , like most inventors did , on the patent part and the making part . 
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this -- that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it ; no one knew about it ; it was a complete and total failure . 
And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread , no one wanted it . 
That the success of sliced bread , like the success of almost everything we 've been talking about at this conference , is not always about what the patent is like , or what the factory is like -- it 's about can you get your idea to spread , or not . 
And I think that the way you 're going to get what you want , or cause the change that you want to change , to happen , is that you 've got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread . 
And it does n't matter to me whether you 're running a coffee shop or you 're an intellectual , or you 're in business , or you 're flying hot air balloons . 
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do . 
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion . 
That people who can spread ideas , regardless of what those ideas are , win . 
And when I talk about it I usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation , and because it 's the easiest sort of way to keep score . 
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I 'm talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do . 
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV . 
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way . 
I call it the " TV - industrial complex . " 
The way the TV - industrial complex works , is you buy some ads -- interrupt some people -- that gets you distribution . 
You use the distribution you get to sell more products . 
You take the profit from that to buy more ads . 
And it goes around and around and around , the same way that military - industrial complex worked a long time ago . 
And that model of , and we heard it yesterday , if we could only get onto the homepage of Google , if we could only figure out how to get promoted there , if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat , and tell them about what we want to do . 
If we do that then everyone would pay attention , and we would win . 
Well , this TV - industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours . 
I mean , all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they were n't expecting , in a way they did n't necessarily want , with an ad , over and over and over again until they bought it . 
And the thing that 's happened is , they canceled the TV - industrial complex . 
That just over the last few years , what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it 's not working the way that it used to . 
This picture is really fuzzy , I apologize ; I had a bad cold when I took it . 
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child . 
Right . I go to the deli ; I 'm sick ; I need to buy some medicine . 
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year . 
100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff -- all so I could ignore every single message . 
And I ignored every message because I do n't have a pain reliever problem . 
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have . 
And I 'm not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem , because I do n't care . 
Here 's a magazine called " Hydrate . " It 's 180 pages about water . 
Right . Articles about water , ads about water . 
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek . 
Now there are magazines about water . 
New products from Coke Japan -- water salad . 
OK . Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks , because they have no idea what 's going to work and what 's not . 
I could n't have written this better myself . It came out four days ago -- I circled the important parts so you can see them here . 
They 've come out ... Arby 's is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold , hoping that that will get people to go to Arby 's and buy a roast beef sandwich . 
Now , I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold , that would get you to get in your car , drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich . 
Now , this is Copernicus , and he was right , when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea . 
The world revolves around me . Me , me , me , me , me . My favorite person -- me . 
I do n't want to get email from anybody ; I want to get " memail . " 
So consumers , and I do n't just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway ; I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something , or people at , you know , the New Yorker who might print your article . 
Consumers do n't care about you at all ; they just do n't care . 
Part of the reason is -- they 've got way more choices than they used to , and way less time . 
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time , the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff . 
And my parable here is you 're driving down the road and you see a cow , and you keep driving because you 've seen cows before . 
Cows are invisible . Cows are boring . 
Who 's going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a cow . Nobody . 
But if the cow was purple -- is n't that a great special effect ? 
I could do that again if you want it . 
If the cow was purple , you 'd notice it for a while . 
I mean , if all cows were purple you 'd get bored with those , too . 
The thing that 's going to decide what gets talked about , what gets done , what gets changed , what gets purchased , what gets built , is : is it remarkable ? 
And " remarkable " is a really cool word because we think it just means neat , but it also means -- worth making a remark about . 
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going . 
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car , big enough to hold a mini in its trunk . 
People are paying full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they do n't have anything in common . 
Every week the number one best - selling DVD in America changes . 
It 's never " The Godfather ; " it 's never " Citizen Kane ; " it 's always some third rate movie with some second rate star . 
But the reason it 's number one is because that 's the week it came out . 
Because it 's new , because it 's fresh . 
Because people saw it and said -- I did n't know that was there -- and they noticed it . 
Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail -- one sells things that are super - expensive in a blue box , and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them . 
The only thing they have in common is that they 're different . 
We 're now in the fashion business , no matter what we do for a living , we 're in the fashion business . 
And the thing is , people in the fashion business know what it 's like to be in the fashion business -- they 're used to it . 
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way . 
How to understand that it 's not about interrupting people with big full - page ads , or insisting on meetings with people . 
But it 's a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread , and which ones do n't . 
This chair -- they sold a billion dollars ' worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair . 
They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work . 
This guy , Lionel Poilane , the most famous baker in the world -- he died two and a half months ago , and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend . 
He lived in Paris . Last year he sold 10 million dollars ' worth of French bread . 
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned , by one baker at a time , in a wood - fired oven . 
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh - pooh - ed it . 
They did n't want to buy his bread . It did n't look like " French bread . " 
It was n't what they expected . 
It was neat ; it was remarkable ; and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally , it became the official bread of three - star restaurants in Paris . 
Now he 's in London , and he ships by FedEx all around the world . 
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people . 
That 's what mass marketing is . 
Smooth out the edges ; go for the center ; that 's the big market . 
They would ignore the geeks , and God forbid , the laggards . 
It was all about going for the center . 
But in a world where the TV - industrial complex is broken , I do n't think that 's a strategy we want to use any more . 
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they 're really good at ignoring you . 
But market to these people because they care . 
These are the people who are obsessed with something . 
And when you talk to them they 'll listen because they like listening -- it 's about them . 
And if you 're lucky , they 'll tell their friends on the rest of the curve , and it 'll spread . 
It 'll spread to the entire curve . 
They have something I call " otaku " -- it 's a great Japanese word . 
It describes the desire of someone who 's obsessed to say , drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place , because that 's what they do : they get obsessed with it . 
To make a product , to market an idea , to come up with any problem you want to solve that does n't have a constituency with an otaku , is almost impossible . 
Instead , you have to find a group that really , desperately cares about what it is you have to say . 
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends . 
There 's a hot sauce otaku , but there 's no mustard otaku . 
That 's why there 's lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces , and not so many kinds of mustard . 
Not because it 's hard to make interesting mustard -- you can make interesting mustard -- but people do n't because no one 's obsessed with it , and thus no one tells their friends . 
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out . 
Krispy Kreme has a strategy , and what they do is , they enter a city , they talk to the people with otaku , and then they spread through the city to the people who 've just crossed the street . 
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars , but it sleeps for 12 minutes . 
Not everybody wants it but they do n't care . 
They want to talk to the people who do , and maybe it 'll spread . 
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world . 
It 's as loud as a 747 jet . You ca n't get in the car ; it 's got bulletproof glass on the windows because they 'll blow out the windshield otherwise . 
But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car , if they 've got the otaku or they 've heard from someone who does , they go ahead and they pick this . 
It 's really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening , and maybe , just maybe those people tell their friends . 
So when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote , right , who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two - hour commercial -- that 's the only thing keeping his company in business -- is that those 50,000 people care desperately enough to watch a two - hour commercial , and then tell their friends . 
Pearl Jam , 96 albums released in the last two years . 
Every one made a profit . How ? 
They only sell them on their website . 
Those people who buy them on the website have the otaku , and then they tell their friends , and it spreads and it spreads . 
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars , 10 times the standard . 
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model . 
Hard Candy nail polish , does n't appeal to everybody , but to the people who love it , they talk about it like crazy . 
This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company , making them a fortune . It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about , because it 's remarkable . 
They did n't just slap a new ad on the product ; they changed what it meant to build a paint product . 
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday 250,000 people go to this site , run by two volunteers , and I can tell you they are hard graders , and they did n't get this way by advertising a lot . 
They got this way by being remarkable , sometimes a little too remarkable . 
And this picture frame has a cord going out the back , and you plug it into the wall . 
My father has this on his desk , and he sees his grandchildren everyday , changing constantly . 
And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk . 
And one person at a time , the idea spreads . 
These are not diamonds , not really . 
They 're made from " cremains . " 
After you 're cremated you can have yourself made into a gem . 
Oh , you like my ring ? It 's my grandmother . 
Fastest - growing business in the whole mortuary industry . 
But you do n't have to be Ozzie Osborne -- you do n't have to be super - outrageous to do this . 
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them . 
A couple of quick rules to wrap up . 
The first one is : Design is free when you get to scale . 
And the people who come up with stuff that 's remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them . 
Number two : The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe . 
Proctor and Gamble knows this , right ? 
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people . 
That 's risky . The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes , be remarkable . 
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do . 
Very good is boring . Very good is average . 
It does n't matter whether you 're making a record album , or you 're an architect , or you have a tract on sociology . 
If it 's very good , it 's not going to work , because no one 's going to notice it . 
So my three stories . 
Silk . Put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section . 
Sales tripled . Why ? 
Milk , milk , milk , milk , milk -- not milk . 
For the people who were there and looking at that section , it was remarkable . 
They did n't triple their sales with advertising ; they tripled it by doing something remarkable . 
That is a remarkable piece of art . You do n't have to like it , but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable . 
Frank Gehry did n't just change a museum ; he changed an entire city 's economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see . 
Now , at countless meetings at , you know , the Portland City Council , or who knows where , they said , we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry ? 
Because he did something that was at the fringes . 
And my big failure ? I came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD format -- this remarkable new format -- and I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos . 
People with 20,000-dollar stereos do n't like new music . 
So what you need to do is figure out who does care . 
Who is going to raise their hand and say , " I want to hear what you 're doing next , " and sell something to them . 
The last example I want to give you . 
This is a map of Soap Lake , Washington . 
As you can see , if that 's nowhere , it 's in the middle of it . 
But they do have a lake . 
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake . 
They do n't anymore . So the founding fathers said , " We 've got some money to spend . 
What can we build here ? " And like most committees , they were going to build something pretty safe . 
And then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist 's rendering -- he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town . 
That 's a purple cow ; that 's something worth noticing . 
I do n't know about you but if they build it , that 's where I 'm going to go . 
Thank you very much for your attention .

Brian Skerry reveals ocean 's glory -- and horror 
I would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for National Geographic magazine . 
I guess I became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child . 
And I wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater , incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors . 
And after even 30 years of doing this , after 30 years of exploring the ocean , I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I 'm at sea . 
But more and more frequently these days I 'm seeing terrible things underwater as well , things that I do n't think most people realize . 
And I 've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story . 
I want people to see what 's happening underwater , both the horror and the magic . 
The first story that I did for National Geographic , where I recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage , was a story I proposed on harp seals . 
The story I wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to engage in courtship , mating and to have their pups . 
And all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide . 
And because I 'm an underwater photographer , I wanted to do this story from both above and below , to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water . 
But as I got more involved in the story , I realized that there were two big environmental issues I could n't ignore . 
The first was that these animals continue to be hunted , killed with hakapiks at about eight , 15 days old . 
It actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet , with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year . 
But as disturbing as that is , I think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming . 
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season . 
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture , there 's a lot of water as well , which was n't there historically . 
And the ice that is there is quite thin . 
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms . 
They only need 12 days from the moment they 're born until they 're on their own . 
But if they do n't get 12 days , they can fall into the ocean and die . 
This is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that 's only about five or seven days old -- still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly -- that has fallen in because of the thin ice , and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase . 
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there . 
I read that last year the pup mortality rate was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence . 
So , clearly , this species has a lot of problems going forward . 
This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic . 
And it received quite a bit of attention . 
And with that , I saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems . 
So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis , in part because I had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years , but also because I read a scientific paper that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years . 
These are the tuna , the billfish and the sharks . 
When I read that , I was blown away by those numbers . 
I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet , but it really was n't , so I wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story . 
I wanted it to be more like war photography , where I was making harder - hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet . 
The first component of the story that I thought was essential , however , was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating . 
You know , I think people go into a restaurant , and somebody orders a steak , and we all know where steak comes from , and somebody orders a chicken , and we know what a chicken is , but when they 're eating bluefin sushi , do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they 're consuming ? 
These are the lions and tigers of the sea . 
In reality , these animals have no terrestrial counterpart ; they 're unique in the world . 
These are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year . 
If we were n't so efficient at catching them , because they grow their entire life , would have 30-year - old bluefin out there that weigh a ton . 
But the truth is we 're way too efficient at catching them , and their stocks have collapsed worldwide . 
This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market that I photographed a couple years ago . 
And every single day these tuna , bluefin like this , are stacked up like cordwood , just warehouse after warehouse . 
As I wandered around and made these pictures , it sort of occurred to me that the ocean 's not a grocery store , you know . 
We ca n't keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result . 
I also , with the story , wanted to show readers how fish are caught , some of the methods that are used to catch fish , like a bottom trawler , which is one of the most common methods in the world . 
This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world . 
You have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end . 
And as this assembly is towed through the water , the doors meet resistance with the ocean , and it opens the mouth of the net , and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom . 
And this just drags over the bottom , in this case to catch shrimp . 
But as you can imagine , it 's catching everything else in its path as well . 
And it 's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom , things like sponges and corals , that critical habitat for other animals . 
This photograph I made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour . 
So he had a handful of shrimp , maybe seven or eight shrimp , and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch . 
These are animals that died in the process , but have no commercial value . 
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner , maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process . 
And to make that point even more visual , I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death , you know , animals like guitarfish , bat rays , flounder , pufferfish , that only an hour before , were on the bottom of the ocean , alive , but now being thrown back as trash . 
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because , currently on planet Earth , we 're killing over 100 million sharks every single year . 
But before I went out to photograph this component , I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know , I think there 's still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark . 
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net . 
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible , it struck me as sort of a crucifixion , if you will . 
This ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in National Geographic . 
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of 100 million sharks . 
And because I love sharks -- I 'm somewhat obsessed with sharks -- I wanted to do another , more celebratory , story about sharks , as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation . 
So I went to the Bahamas because there 're very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days , but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy , largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago . 
And I wanted to show several species that we had n't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations . 
One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach , in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water . 
This is a low - altitude photograph that I made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind . 
But the one thing I definitely did n't want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters . 
I did n't want them to be overly threatening or scary . 
And with this photograph of a beautiful 15-feet , probably 14-feet , I guess , female tiger shark , I sort of think I got to that goal , where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose , and my strobe created a shadow on her face . 
And I think it 's a gentler picture , a little less threatening , a little more respectful of the species . 
I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead , an animal that really had n't been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago . 
It 's a very solitary creature . 
But this is an animal that 's considered data deficient by science in both Florida and in the Bahamas . 
You know , we know almost nothing about them . 
We do n't know where they migrate to or from , where they mate , where they have their pups , and yet , hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years . 
You know , we 're losing them faster than we can possibly find them . 
This is the oceanic whitetip shark , an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species , if you pay attention to such lists . 
But it 's an animal that 's about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range . 
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water , and because we were n't working on the bottom , I brought along a shark cage here , and my friend , shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage . 
You 'll see that the photographer , of course , was not inside the cage here , so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess . 
And lastly with this story , I also wanted to focus on baby sharks , shark nurseries . 
And I went to the island of Bimini , in the Bahamas , to work with lemon shark pups . 
This is a photo of a lemon shark pup , and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves . 
This is a very sort of un - shark - like photograph . 
It 's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture . 
But , you know , here we see a shark that 's maybe 10 or 11 inches long swimming in about a foot of water . 
But this is crucial habitat and it 's where they spend the first two , three years of their lives , until they 're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef . 
After I left Bimini , I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort . 
And other recent stories have looked at single , flagship species , if you will , that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats . 
One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle . 
This is the largest , widest - ranging , deepest - diving and oldest of all turtle species . 
Here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of Trinidad . 
These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years . 
And there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by . 
And today , they crawl out and see condominiums . 
But despite this amazing longevity , they 're now considered critically endangered . 
In the Pacific , where I made this photograph , their stocks have declined about 90 percent in the last 15 years . 
This is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey . 
Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity . 
But that 's due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore . 
Nature has learned to compensate with that , and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds . 
But what they ca n't deal with is anthropogenic stresses , human things , like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net . 
I actually jumped in and photographed this , and with the fisherman 's permission , I cut the turtle out , and it was able to swim free . 
But , you know , thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate , and the species ' future is in great danger . 
Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with is the story I did on the right whale . 
And essentially , the story is this with right whales , that about a million years ago , there was one species of right whale on the planet , but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated , the species sort of separated , and today we have essentially two distinct stocks . 
We have the Southern right whale that we see here and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida . 
Now , both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers , but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they 're located in places farther away from human activity . 
The North Atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales ; they live along the east coast of North America , United States and Canada , and they have to deal with all these urban ills . 
This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida . 
You can see the coal burning plant in the background . 
They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean , and maybe even affecting their reproduction . 
They also get entangled in fishing gear . 
This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale . 
And those white markings are not natural markings . 
These are entanglement scars . 
72 percent of the population has such scars , but most do n't shed the gear , things like lobster traps and crab pots . 
They hold on to them , and it eventually kills them . 
And the other problem is they get hit by ships . 
And this was an animal that was struck by a ship in Nova Scotia , Canada being towed in , where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death , which was indeed a ship strike . 
So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals and keeping their numbers very low . 
And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population , I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales that had only been discovered about 10 years ago in the sub - Antarctic of New Zealand , a place called the Auckland Islands . 
I went down there in the winter time . 
And these are animals that had never seen humans before , and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen . 
And I got in the water with them , and I was amazed at how curious they were . 
This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet and one of these amazingly beautiful , 45-foot , 70-ton whales , like a city bus just swimming up , you know . 
They were in perfect condition , very fat and healthy , robust , no entanglement scars , the way they 're supposed to look . 
You know , I read that the pilgrims , when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in 1620 , wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay on the backs of right whales . 
And we ca n't go back and see that today , but maybe we can preserve what we have left . 
And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope , a story I did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing , the global fish crisis story . 
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand because New Zealand was rather progressive , and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean . 
And I really wanted this story to be about three things : I wanted it to be about abundance , about diversity and about resilience . 
And one of the first places I worked was a reserve called Goat Island in Leigh of New Zealand . 
What the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in 1975 , they hoped and expected that certain things might happen . 
For example , they hoped that certain species of fish like the New Zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction . 
And they did come back . What they could n't predict was that other things would happen . 
For example , these fish predate on sea urchins , and when the fish were all gone , all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins . 
But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population , low and behold , kelp forests emerged in shallow water . 
And that 's because the urchins eat kelp . 
So when the fish control the urchin population , the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium . 
You know , this is probably how the ocean looked here one or 200 years ago , but nobody was around to tell us . 
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well , in beautiful , fragile , protected areas like in Fiordland , where this sea pen colony was found . 
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color . 
In the northern part of New Zealand , I dove in the blue water , where the water 's a little warmer , and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon . 
Every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy , from tiny , little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold . 
And I wanted to finish with this photograph , a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand when I just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me . 
And I was in a place that had only been protected about 20 years ago . 
And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years , and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the 1960s . 
And that 's because it 's been protected , that it has come back . 
So I think the message is clear . 
The ocean is , indeed , resilient and tolerant to a point , but we must be good custodians . 
I became an underwater photographer because I fell in love with the sea , and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it , and I do n't think it 's too late . 
Thank you very much .

In this short , optimistic talk from TED2009 , Pete Alcorn shares a vision of the world of two centuries from now -- when declining populations and growing opportunity prove Malthus was wrong . 
community , social change 
563 
Pete Alcorn on the world in 2200 
I used to be a Malthusian . 
This was my mental model of the world : exploding population , small planet ; it 's going to lead to ugly things . 
But I 'm moving past Malthus , because I think that we just might be about 150 years from a kind of new enlightenment . 
Here 's why . 
This is the U.N. 's population data , you may have seen , for the world . 
And the world 's population expected to top out at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion , late this century . 
And after that , most likely it 's going to begin to decline . 
So what then ? 
Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth . 
So a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation , maybe depression . 
But a declining population is going to have at least two very beneficial economic effects . 
One : fewer people on a fixed amount of land make investing in property a bad bet . 
In the cities , a lot of the cost of property is actually wrapped up in its speculative value . 
Take away land speculation , price of land drops . 
And that begins to lift a heavy burden off the world 's poor . 
Number two : a declining population means scarce labor . 
Scarce labor drives wages . 
As wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class . 
Now I 'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death . 
But look what happened in Europe after the plague : rising wages , land reform , technological innovation , birth of the middle class ; and after that , forward - looking social movements like the Renaissance , and later the Enlightenment . 
Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward , romanticizing the past . 
All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden , and descend through a kind of profligate present to a very ugly future . 
So human history is viewed as sort of this downhill slide from the good old days . 
But I think we 're in for another change , about two generations after the top of that curve , once the effects of a declining population start to settle in . 
At that point , we 'll start romanticizing the future again , instead of the nasty , brutish past . 
So why does this matter ? 
Why talk about social - economic movements that may be more than a century away ? 
Because transitions are dangerous times . 
When land owners start to lose money , and labor demands more pay , there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future . 
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions . 
If we have a positive view about the future then we may be able to accelerate through that turn , instead of careening off a cliff . 
If we can make it through the next 150 years , I think that your great great grandchildren will forget all about Malthus . 
And instead , they 'll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment . 
Thank you .

By piecing together a complex ecological puzzle , biologist Willie Smits has found a way to re - grow clearcut rainforest in Borneo , saving local orangutans -- and creating a thrilling blueprint for restoring fragile ecosystems .

Willie Smits restores a rainforest 
I was walking in the market one day with my wife , and somebody stuck a cage in my face . 
And in between those slits were the saddest eyes I 've ever seen . 
There was a very sick orangutan baby , my first encounter . 
That evening I came back to the market in the dark and I heard " uhh , uhh , " and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap . 
Of course , the cage was salvaged . 
I took up the little baby , massaged her , forced her to drink until she finally started breathing normally . 
This is Uce . 
She 's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain , and this is Matahari , her second son , which , by the way , is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued , Dodoy . 
That changed my life quite dramatically , and as of today , I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers . 
No . No . No . Wrong . 
It 's horrible . It 's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild . 
It 's not good . 
This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing . 
Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together , just now like victims for every baby , six have disappeared from the forest . 
The deforestation , especially for oil palm , to provide biofuel for Western countries is what 's causing these problems . 
And those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat , the largest accumulation of organic material in the world . 
When you open this for growing oil palms you 're creating CO2 volcanoes that are emitting so much CO2 that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world , after China and the United States . 
And we do n't have any industry at all -- it 's only because of this deforestation . 
And these are horrible images . 
I 'm not going to talk too long about it , but there are so many of the family of Uce , which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest , that still have to go through that process . 
And I do n't know anymore where to put them . 
So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her but also a solution that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests , to get their hands on the last timber and that are causing , in that way , the loss of habitat and all those victims . 
So I created the place Samboja Lestari , and the idea was , if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of where there is really nothing left , no one will have an excuse to say , " Yeah , but ... " 
No . Everyone should be able to follow this . 
So we 're in East Borneo . This is the place where I started . 
As you can see there 's only yellow terrain . 
There 's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there . 
In 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there . 
There was a huge amount of crime . 
People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water . 
There was no agricultural productivity left . 
This was the poorest district in the whole province and it was a total extinction of wildlife . 
This was like a biological desert . 
When I stood there in the grass , it 's hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this waving grass . 
Still , four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people . 
The climate has changed . I will show you : no more flooding , no more fires . 
It 's no longer the poorest district , and there is a huge development of biodiversity . 
We 've got over 1,000 species . We have 137 bird species as of today . 
We have 30 species of reptiles . 
So what happened here ? We created a huge economic failure in this forest . 
So basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm . 
But we saw the same thing . 
We had slash and burn agriculture ; people can not afford the fertilizer , so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there ; the fires become more frequent , and after a while you 're stuck with an area of land where there is no fertility left . 
There are no trees left . 
Still , in this place , in this grassland where you can see our very first office there on that hill , four years later , there is this one green blop on the Earth 's surface ... 
And there are all these animals , and all these people happy , and there 's this economic value . 
So how 's this possible ? 
It was quite simple . If you 'll look at the steps : we bought the land , we dealt with the fire , and then only , we started doing the reforestation by combining agriculture with forestry . 
Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary . 
But we made sure that in every step of the way the local people were going to be fully involved so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that . 
The people would become the defenders of that forest . 
So we do the " people , profit , planet " principles , but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belongs to the state , people say , " It belongs to me , it belongs to everyone . " 
And then we apply all these other principles like transparency , professional management , measurable results , scalability , [ unclear ] , etc . 
What we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation . 
You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control , whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice . 
And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out . 
Now in this recipe you also have the cost . 
You also know how much labor is needed . 
If you can drop this recipe on the map on a sandy soil , on a clay soil , on a steep slope , on flat soil , you put those different recipes ; if you combine them , out of that comes a business plan , comes a work plan , and you can optimize it for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have , and you can do it . 
This is how it looks like in practice . We have this grass we want to get rid of . 
It exudes [ unclear]-like compounds from the roots . 
The acacia trees are of a very low value but we need them to restore the micro - climate , to protect the soil and to shake out the grasses . 
And after eight years they might actually yield some timber -- that is , if you can preserve it in the right way , which we can do with bamboo peels . 
It 's an old temple - building technique from Japan but bamboo is very fire - susceptible . 
So if we would plant that in the beginning we would have a very high risk of losing everything again . 
So we plant it later , along the waterways to filter the water , provide the raw products just in time for when the timber becomes available . 
So the idea is : how to integrate these flows in space , over time and with the limited means you have . 
So we plant the trees , we plant these pineapples and beans and ginger in between , to reduce the competition for the trees , the crop fertilizer . Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops , for the people , but also helps the trees . The farmers have free land , the system yields early income , the orangutans get healthy food and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration while even saving some money . 
So beautiful . What a theory . 
But is it really that easy ? 
Not really , because if you looked at what happened in 1998 , the fire started . 
This is an area of about 50 million hectares . 
January . 
February . 
March . 
April . 
May. 
We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months . 
This is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States . 
And once the soil gets dried , you 're in a dry season -- you get cracks , oxygen goes in , flames come out and the problem starts all over again . 
So how to break that cycle ? 
Fire is the biggest problem . 
This is what it looked like for three months . 
For three months , the automatic lights outside did not go off because it was that dark . 
We lost all the crops . No children gained weight for over a year ; they lost 12 IQ points . It was a disaster for orangutans and people . 
So these fires are really the first things to work on . 
That was why I put it as a single point up there . 
And you need the local people for that because these grasslands , once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients to the first rainfall -- going to the sea killing off the coral reefs there . 
So you have to do it with the local people . 
That is the short - term solution but you also need a long - term solution . 
So what we did is , we created a ring of sugar palms around the area . 
These sugar palms turn out to be fire - resistant -- also flood - resistant , by the way -- and they provide a lot of income for local people . 
This is what it looks like : the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice -- and the only thing you harvest is sugar water , carbon dioxide , rain fall and a little bit of sunshine . 
In principle , you make those trees into biological photovoltaic cells . 
And you can create so much energy from this -- they produce three times more energy per hectare per year , because you can tap them on a daily basis . 
You do n't need to harvest [ unclear ] or any other of the crops . 
So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics , which is still unexploited , and doing it in combination with technology . 
But also your legal side needs to be in very good order . 
So we bought that land , and here is where we started our project -- in the middle of nowhere . 
And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil , and we were actually monitoring , measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares , 5,000 acres . 
And this forest is quite different . 
What I really did was I just followed nature , and nature does n't know monocultures , but a natural forest is multilayered . 
That means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light , it can store more carbon in the system , it can provide more functions . 
But , it 's more complicated . It 's not that simple , and you have to work with the people . 
So , just like nature , we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that , we grow the slower growing , primary - grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light . Then , what is just as important : get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves , bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours . 
And they become like nutrient pumps . 
You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen , and without those microorganisms , you wo n't have any performance at all . 
And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day . 
We could have planted many , many more , but we did n't want to because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable . 
We did n't want to lose the people that are going to work in that plantation . 
And we do a lot of work here . 
We use indicator plants to look at what soil types , or what vegetables will grow , or what trees will grow here . 
And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space . 
This is what it looks like in reality ; you have this irregular ring around it , with strips of 100 meters wide , with sugar palms that can provide income for 648 families . 
It 's only a small part of the area . 
The nursery , in here , is quite different . 
If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe , for instance , from the Urals up to England , you know how many ? 
165 . 
In this nursery , we 're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species . 
Can you imagine ? 
You do need to know what you are working with , but it 's that diversity which makes it work . 
That you can go from this zero situation , by planting the vegetables and the trees , or directly , the trees in the lines in that grass there , putting up the buffer zone , producing your compost , and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest there are crops that can be used . 
In the beginning , maybe pineapples and beans and corn ; in the second phase , there will be bananas and papayas ; later on , there will be chocolate and chilies . 
And then slowly , the trees start taking over , bringing in produce from the fruits , from the timber , from the fuel wood . 
And finally , the sugar palm forest takes over and provides the people with permanent income . 
On the top left , underneath those green stripes , you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space . 
And in that area we started growing some acacia trees that you just saw before . 
So this is after one year . 
And this is after two years . 
And that 's green . If you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass . 
We plant in the seedlings mixed with the bananas , the papayas , all the crops for the local people , but the trees are growing up fast in between as well . 
And three years later , 137 species of birds are living here . 
So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius . 
Air humidity is up 10 percent . 
Cloud cover -- I 'm going to show it to you -- is up . 
Rainfall is up . 
And all these species and income . 
This ecolodge that I built here , three years before , was an empty , yellow field . 
This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency -- it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself is taking a picture . 
Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon , how the forest is developing , and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation . 
We can use these data now to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology . 
We actually have it already with Google Earth . 
If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks , and use Google Earth in combination with that , you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced , which company is stealing the timber , and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here . 
So this is the Samboja Lestari area . 
You measure how the trees grow back , but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back . 
And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced , how many medicines can be kept here . 
And finally I made it into the rain machine because this forest is now creating its own rain . 
This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water ; it 's 80 percent surrounded by seawater , and we have now a lot of intrusion there . 
Now we looked at the clouds above this forest ; we looked at the reforestation area , the semi - open area and the open area . 
And look at these images . 
I 'll just run them very quickly through . 
In the tropics , raindrops are not formed from ice crystals , which is the case in the temperate zones , you need the trees with [ unclear ] , chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops . 
So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate , and you have the trees to initiate the rain . 
And look , there 's now 11.2 percent more clouds -- already , after three years . 
If you look at rainfall , it was already up 20 percent at that time . 
Let 's look at the next year , and you can see that that trend is continuing . 
Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall , that cap is now widening and getting higher . 
And if we look at the rainfall pattern above Samboja Lestari , it used to be the driest place , but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there . 
So you can actually change the climate . 
When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears , but afterwards , as soon as the wind stabilizes , you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area . 
So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do , because we actually can make that difference if you integrate the various technologies . 
And it 's nice to have the science , but it still depends mostly upon the people , on your education . 
We have our farmer schools . 
But the real success of course , is our band -- because if a baby is born , we will play , so everyone 's our family and you do n't make trouble with your family . 
This is how it looks . 
We have this road going around the area , which brings the people electricity and water from our own area . 
We have the zone with the sugar palms , and then we have this fence with very thorny palms to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle -- and the people apart . 
And inside , we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive , because for the last 12 years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared . 
All the seeds get eaten . 
So now we do the monitoring on the inside -- from towers , satellites , ultralights . 
Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back . 
And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees -- you have the shade trees planted in year one , then you underplanted with the sugar palms , and you plant this thorny fence . 
And after a few years , you can remove some of those shade trees . 
The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel , and they can build a house , they have some fuel wood to cook with . 
And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like . 
They have enough income for three families . 
But whatever you do in that program , it has to be fully supported by the people , meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local , cultural values . 
There is no simple one recipe for one place . 
You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt -- that it 's transparent . 
Like here , in Samboja Lestari , we divide that ring in groups of 20 families . 
If one member trespasses the agreement , and does cut down trees , the other 19 members have to decide what 's going to happen to him . 
If the group does n't take action , the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group that does n't comply with those great deals that we are offering them . 
In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative -- they have a democratic culture there , so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system . 
In summary , if you look at it , in year one the people can sell their land to get income , but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation , the working with the orangutans , and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft . 
They also get free land in between the trees , where they can grow their crops . 
They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project . 
They get building material for houses , a contract for selling the sugar , so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally . 
They get all these other benefits : environmentally , money , they get education -- it 's a great deal . 
And everything is based upon that one thing -- make sure that forest remains there . 
So if we want to help the orangutans -- what I actually set out to do -- we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit . 
Now I think the real key to doing it , to give a simple answer , is integration . 
I hope -- if you want to know more , you can read more .

Jaime Lerner reinvented urban space in his native Curitiba , Brazil . Along the way , he changed the way city planners worldwide see what ’s possible in the metropolitan landscape . 
cities , culture , design , green , humor , sustainability , transportation

Jaime Lerner sings of the city 
I hope you 'll understand my English . 
In the mornings it is terrible , and the afternoon is worst . 
During many years , I made some speeches starting with this saying : " City is not a problem , it 's a solution . " 
And more and more , I 'm convinced that it 's not only a solution for a country , but it 's a solution for the problem of climate change . 
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities . 
I 'm working in cities for almost 40 years , and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big , or the other mayors say , " We do n't have financial resources , " I would like to say from the experience I had : every city in the world can be improved in less than three years . 
There 's no matter of scale . It 's not a question of scale , it 's not a question of financial resources . 
Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co - responsibility and also a design . 
So to start , I want to introduce some characters from a book I made for teenagers . 
The best example of quality of life is the turtle because the turtle is an example of living and working together . 
And when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura , and can we imagine , if we cut the casque of the turtle , how sad she 's going to be ? 
And that 's what we 're doing in our cities : living here , working here , having leisure here . 
And most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city . 
So , the other character is Otto , the automobile . 
He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave . 
The chairs are on the tables and still drinking , and he drinks a lot . 
And he coughs a lot . Very egotistical : he carries only one or two people and he asks always for more infrastructure . 
Freeways . 
He 's a very demanding person . 
And on the other hand , Accordion , the friendly bus , he carries 300 people -- 275 in Sweden ; 300 Brazilians . 
Speaking about the design : every city has its own design . 
Curitiba , my city : three million in the metropolitan area , 1,800,000 people in the city itself . 
Curitiba , Rio : it 's like two birds kissing themselves . 
Oaxaca , San Francisco -- it 's very easy : Market Street , Van Ness and the waterfront . 
And every city has its own design . 
But to make it happen , sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design -- an idea that everyone , or the large majority , will help you to make it happen . 
And that 's the structure of the city of Curitiba . 
And it 's an example of living and working together . 
And this is where we have more density ; it 's where we have more public transport . 
So , this system started in ' 74 . We started with 25,000 passengers a day , now it 's 2,200,000 passengers a day . 
And it took 25 years until another city ... 
which is Bogota , and they did a very good job . 
And now there 's 83 cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba . 
And one thing : it 's important not for only your own city ; every city , besides its normal problems , they have a very important role in being with the whole humanity . 
That means mostly two main issues -- mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities . 
And this is an articulated bus , double - articulated . 
And we are very close to my house . 
You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there . 
And that 's the evolution of the system . 
What in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes : the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway . 
That 's why , I 'm trying to say , it 's like metro - nizing the bus . 
This is the design of the bus , and you can pay before entering the bus you 're boarding . 
And for handicapped , they can use this as a normal system . 
What I 'm trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars -- more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars , it 's ... 
-- that 's why when we 're talking about sustainability , it 's not enough , green buildings . 
It 's not enough , a new materials . 
It 's not enough , new sources of energy . 
It 's the concept of the city , the design of the city , that 's also important , too . And also , how to teach the children . 
I 'll speak on this later on . 
Our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems . 
We started in ' 83 , proposing for the city of Rio how to connect the subway with the bus . 
The subway was against , of course . 
And 23 years after , they called us to develop -- we 're developing this idea . 
And you can understand how different it 's going to be , the image of Rio with the system -- one - minute frequency . 
And it 's not Shanghai , it 's not being colored during the day , only at night it will look this way . 
And before you say it 's a Norman Foster design , we designed this in ' 83 . 
And this is the model , how it 's going to work . So , it 's the same system ; the vehicle is different . And that 's the model . 
What I 'm trying to say is , I 'm not trying to prove which system of transport is better . 
I 'm trying to say we have to combine all the systems , and with one condition : never -- if you have a subway , if you have surface systems , if you have any kind of system -- never compete in the same space . 
And coming back to the car , I always used to say that the car is like your mother - in - law : you have to have good relationship with her , but she can not command your life . 
So , when the only woman in your life is your mother - in - law , you have a problem . 
So , all the ideas about how to transform through design -- old quarries and open universities and botanic garden -- all of it 's related to how we teach the children . 
And the children , we teach during six months how to separate their garbage . 
And after , the children teach their parents . 
And now we have 70 percent -- since 20 years , it 's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world . 
Seven zero . 
So teach the children . 
I would like to say , if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what 's said , but do n't forget the cities and the children . 
I 'm working in a museum and also a multi - use city , because you can not have empty places during 18 hours a day . 
You should have always a structure of living and working together . 
Try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the 24 hours . 
Another issue is , a city 's like our family portrait . 
We do n't rip our family portrait , even if we do n't like the nose of our uncle , because this portrait is you . 
And these are the references that we have in any city . 
This is the main pedestrian mall ; we did it in 72 hours . Yes , you have to be fast . 
And these are the references from our ethnic contribution . 
This is the Italian portal , the Ukrainian park , the Polish park , the Japanese square , the German park . 
All of a sudden , the Soviet Union , they split . 
And since we have people from Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan , Tajikistan , [ unclear ] , we have to stop the program . 
Do n't forget : creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget . 
If you cut two zeros , it 's much better . 
And this is the Wire Opera theater . We did it in two months . 
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks . 
Quarries once made the nature , and sometimes we took this and we transformed . 
And every part can be transformed ; every frog can be transformed in a prince . 
So , in a city , you have to work fast . 
Planning takes time . And I 'm proposing urban acupuncture . 
That means me , with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning . 
And this is an acupuncture note -- or I.M. Pei 's . Some small ones can make the city better . 
The smallest park in New York , the most beautiful : 32 meters . 
So , I want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials -- but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end , because we do n't have the whole time to plan . 
And I think creativity , innovation is starting . 
And we can not have all the answers . 
So when you start -- and we can not be so prepotent on having all the answers -- it 's important starting and having the contribution from people , and they could teach you if you 're not in the right track . 
At the end , I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song . 
OK ? 
Please , allow me just two minutes . 
You 're going to make the music and the rhythm .

In this poignant , funny follow - up to his fabled 2006 talk , Sir Ken Robinson makes the case for a radical shift from standardized schools to personalized learning -- creating conditions where kids ' natural talents can flourish .

Sir Ken Robinson : Bring on the learning revolution ! 
I was here four years ago , and I remember , at the time , that the talks were n't put online . 
I think they were given to TEDsters in a box , a box set of DVDs , which they put on their shelves , where they are now . 
And actually , Chris called me a week after I 'd given my talk and he said , " We 're going to start putting them online . 
Can we put yours online ? " And I said , " Sure . " 
And four years later , as I said , it 's been seen by four ... 
Well , it 's been downloaded four million times . 
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who 've seen it . 
And , as Chris says , there is a hunger for videos of me . 
... do n't you feel ? 
So , this whole event has been an elaborate build - up to me doing another one for you , so here it is . 
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis . 
And I referenced that at the end of my last talk . 
So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes , frankly . 
So , as I was saying ... 
You see , he 's right . 
I mean , there is a major climate crisis , obviously , and I think if people do n't believe it , they should get out more . 
But I believe there 's a second climate crisis , which is as severe , which has the same origins , and that we have to deal with with the same urgency . 
And I mean by this -- and you may say , by the way , " Look , I 'm good . 
I have one climate crisis ; I do n't really need the second one . " 
But this is a crisis of , not natural resources -- though I believe that 's true -- but a crisis of human resources . 
I believe fundamentally , as many speakers have said during the past few days , that we make very poor use of our talents . 
Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be , or if they have any to speak of . 
I meet all kinds of people who do n't think they 're really good at anything . 
Actually , I kind of divide the world into two groups now . 
Jeremy Bentham , the great utilitarian philosopher , once spiked this argument . 
He said , " There are two types of people in this world : those who divide the world into two types and those who do not . " 
Well , I do . 
I meet all kinds of people who do n't enjoy what they do . 
They simply go through their lives getting on with it . 
They get no great pleasure from what they do . 
They endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend . 
But I also meet people who love what they do and could n't imagine doing anything else . 
If you said to them , " Do n't do this anymore , " they 'd wonder what you were talking about . 
Because it is n't what they do , it 's who they are . They say , " But this is me , you know . 
It would be foolish for me to abandon this , because it speaks to my most authentic self . " 
And it 's not true of enough people . 
In fact , on the contrary , I think it 's still true of a minority of people . 
I think there are many possible explanations for it . 
And high among them is education , because education , in a way , dislocates very many people from their natural talents . 
And human resources are like natural resources ; they 're often buried deep . 
You have to go looking for them , they 're not just lying around on the surface . 
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves . 
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens , but too often it 's not . 
Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it 's not enough . 
Reform is no use anymore , because that 's simply improving a broken model . 
What we need -- and the word 's been used many times during the course of the past few days -- is not evolution , but a revolution in education . 
This has to be transformed into something else . 
One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education . 
Innovation is hard because it means doing something that people do n't find very easy , for the most part . 
It means challenging what we take for granted , things that we think are obvious . 
The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense ; things that people think , " Well , it ca n't be done any other way because that 's the way it 's done . " 
I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln , who I thought you 'd be pleased to have quoted at this point . 
He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress . 
I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time . 
We do n't teach American history in Britain . 
We suppress it . You know , this is our policy . 
So , no doubt , something fascinating was happening in December 1862 , which the Americans among us will be aware of . 
But he said this : " The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present . 
The occasion is piled high with difficulty , and we must rise with the occasion . " 
I love that . 
Not rise to it , rise with it . 
" As our case is new , so we must think anew and act anew . 
We must disenthrall ourselves , and then we shall save our country . " 
I love that word , " disenthrall . " 
You know what it means ? 
That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to , which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things , the way things are . 
And many of our ideas have been formed , not to meet the circumstances of this century , but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries . 
But our minds are still hypnotized by them , and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them . 
Now , doing this is easier said than done . 
It 's very hard to know , by the way , what it is you take for granted . 
And the reason is that you take it for granted . 
So let me ask you something you may take for granted . 
How many of you here are over the age of 25 ? 
That 's not what I think you take for granted , I 'm sure you 're familiar with that already . 
Are there any people here under the age of 25 ? 
Great . Now , those over 25 , could you put your hands up if you 're wearing your wristwatch ? 
Now that 's a great deal of us , is n't it ? 
Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing . 
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches . 
I do n't mean they ca n't or they 're not allowed to , they just often choose not to . 
And the reason is , you see , that we were brought up in a pre - digital culture , those of us over 25 . 
And so for us , if you want to know the time you have to wear something to tell it . 
Kids now live in a world which is digitized , and the time , for them , is everywhere . 
They see no reason to do this . 
And by the way , you do n't need to do it either ; it 's just that you 've always done it and you carry on doing it . 
My daughter never wears a watch , my daughter Kate , who 's 20 . 
She does n't see the point . 
As she says , " It 's a single function device . " 
" Like , how lame is that ? " 
And I say , " No , no , it tells the date as well . " 
" It has multiple functions . " 
But , you see , there are things we 're enthralled to in education . 
Let me give you a couple of examples . 
One of them is the idea of linearity : that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right , you will end up set for the rest of your life . 
Everybody who 's spoken at TED has told us implicitly , or sometimes explicitly , a different story : that life is not linear ; it 's organic . 
We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us . 
But , you know , we have become obsessed with this linear narrative . 
And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college . 
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college . 
Certain sorts of college . 
I do n't mean you should n't go to college , but not everybody needs to go and not everybody needs to go now . 
Maybe they go later , not right away . 
And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing . 
There was this guy buying a book , he was in his 30s . 
And I said , " What do you do ? " 
And he said , " I 'm a fireman . " 
And I said , " How long have you been a fireman ? " 
He said , " Always . I 've always been a fireman . " 
And I said , " Well , when did you decide ? " 
He said , " As a kid . " He said , " Actually , it was a problem for me at school , because at school , everybody wanted to be a fireman . " 
He said , " But I wanted to be a fireman . " 
And he said , " When I got to the senior year of school , my teachers did n't take it seriously . 
This one teacher did n't take it seriously . 
He said I was throwing my life away if that 's all I chose to do with it ; that I should go to college , I should become a professional person , that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that . " 
And he said , " It was humiliating because he said it in front of the whole class and I really felt dreadful . 
But it 's what I wanted , and as soon as I left school , I applied to the fire service and I was accepted . " 
And he said , " You know , I was thinking about that guy recently , just a few minutes ago when you were speaking , about this teacher , " he said , " because six months ago , I saved his life . " 
He said , " He was in a car wreck , and I pulled him out , gave him CPR , and I saved his wife 's life as well . " 
He said , " I think he thinks better of me now . " 
You know , to me , human communities depend upon a diversity of talent , not a singular conception of ability . 
And at the heart of our challenges -- At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence . 
This linearity thing is a problem . 
When I arrived in L.A. 
about nine years ago , I came across a policy statement -- very well - intentioned -- which said , " College begins in kindergarten . " 
No , it does n't . 
It does n't . 
If we had time , I could go into this , but we do n't . 
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten . 
A friend of mine once said , " You know , a three year - old is not half a six year - old . " 
They 're three . 
But as we just heard in this last session , there 's such competition now to get into kindergarten -- to get to the right kindergarten -- that people are being interviewed for it at three . 
Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels , you know , with their resumes , flipping through and saying , " Well , this is it ? " 
" You 've been around for 36 months , and this is it ? " 
" You 've achieved nothing -- commit . 
Spent the first six months breastfeeding , the way I can see it . " 
See , it 's outrageous as a conception , but it [ unclear ] . 
The other big issue is conformity . 
We have built our education systems on the model of fast food . 
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day . 
You know there are two models of quality assurance in catering . 
One is fast food , where everything is standardized . 
The other are things like Zagat and Michelin restaurants , where everything is not standardized , they 're customized to local circumstances . 
And we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education , and it 's impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies . 
I think we have to recognize a couple of things here . 
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse . 
People have very different aptitudes . 
I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar . 
You know , it worked out for Eric , that 's all I 'm saying . 
In a way , it did not for me . 
I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it . 
It just would n't work . 
But it 's not only about that . 
It 's about passion . 
Often , people are good at things they do n't really care for . 
It 's about passion , and what excites our spirit and our energy . 
And if you 're doing the thing that you love to do , that you 're good at , time takes a different course entirely . 
My wife 's just finished writing a novel , and I think it 's a great book , but she disappears for hours on end . 
You know this , if you 're doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes . 
If you 're doing something that does n't resonate with your spirit , five minutes feels like an hour . 
And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it does n't feed their spirit , it does n't feed their energy or their passion . 
So I think we have to change metaphors . 
We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education , a manufacturing model , which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people . 
We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture . 
We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process ; it 's an organic process . 
And you can not predict the outcome of human development . 
All you can do , like a farmer , is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish . 
So when we look at reforming education and transforming it , it is n't like cloning a system . 
There are great ones , like KIPP 's ; it 's a great system . 
There are many great models . 
It 's about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you 're actually teaching . 
And doing that , I think , is the answer to the future because it 's not about scaling a new solution ; it 's about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions , but with external support based on a personalized curriculum . 
Now in this room , there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business , in multimedia , in the Internet . 
These technologies , combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers , provide an opportunity to revolutionize education . 
And I urge you to get involved in it because it 's vital , not just to ourselves , but to the future of our children . 
But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model , where each school can be flourishing tomorrow . 
That 's where children experience life . 
Or at home , if that 's where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends . 
There 's been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of this few days . 
And I wanted to just very quickly ... 
I was very struck by Natalie Merchant 's songs last night , recovering old poems . 
I wanted to read you a quick , very short poem from W. B. Yeats , who some of you may know . 
He wrote this to his love , Maud Gonne , and he was bewailing the fact that he could n't really give her what he thought she wanted from him . 
And he says , " I 've got something else , but it may not be for you . " 
He says this : " Had I the heavens ' embroidered cloths , Enwrought with gold and silver light , The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half - light , I would spread the cloths under your feet : But I , being poor , have only my dreams ; I have spread my dreams under your feet ; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams . " 
And every day , everywhere , our children spread their dreams beneath our feet . 
And we should tread softly . 
Thank you . 
Thank you very much .

Scilla Elworthy : Fighting with non - violence 
In half a century of trying to help prevent wars , there 's one question that never leaves me : How do we deal with extreme violence without using force in return ? 
When you 're faced with brutality , whether it 's a child facing a bully on a playground or domestic violence -- or , on the streets of Syria today , facing tanks and shrapnel , what 's the most effective thing to do ? 
Fight back ? Give in ? 
Use more force ? 
This question : " How do I deal with a bully without becoming a thug in return ? " 
has been with me ever since I was a child . 
I remember I was about 13 , glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents ' living room as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest , and kids not much older than me were throwing themselves at the tanks and getting mown down . 
And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase . 
And my mother came up and said , " What on Earth are you doing ? " 
And I said , " I 'm going to Budapest . " 
And she said , " What on Earth for ? " 
And I said , " Kids are getting killed there . 
There 's something terrible happening . " 
And she said , " Do n't be so silly . " 
And I started to cry . 
And she got it , she said , " Okay , I see it 's serious . 
You 're much too young to help . 
You need training . I 'll help you . 
But just unpack your suitcase . " 
And so I got some training and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s . 
But I realized that what I really needed to know I could n't get from training courses . 
I wanted to understand how violence , how oppression , works . 
And what I 've discovered since is this : Bullies use violence in three ways . 
They use political violence to intimidate , physical violence to terrorize and mental or emotional violence to undermine . 
And only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence . 
Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence , and 27 years later he and his colleagues had slowly and carefully honed the skills , the incredible skills , that they needed to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known into a democracy . 
And they did it in a total devotion to non - violence . 
They realized that using force against force does n't work . 
So what does work ? 
Over time I 've collected about a half - dozen methods that do work -- of course there are many more -- that do work and that are effective . 
And the first is that the change that has to take place has to take place here , inside me . 
It 's my response , my attitude , to oppression that I 've got control over , and that I can do something about . 
And what I need to develop is self - knowledge to do that . 
That means I need to know how I tick , when I collapse , where my formidable points are , where my weaker points are . 
When do I give in ? 
What will I stand up for ? 
And meditation or self - inspection is one of the ways -- again it 's not the only one -- it 's one of the ways of gaining this kind of inner power . 
And my heroine here -- like Satish 's -- is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma . 
She was leading a group of students on a protest in the streets of Rangoon . 
They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns . 
And she realized straight away that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers were more scared than the student protesters behind her . 
But she told the students to sit down . 
And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun , put her hand on it and lower it . 
And no one got killed . 
So that 's what the mastery of fear can do -- not only faced with machine guns , but if you meet a knife fight in the street . 
But we have to practice . 
So what about our fear ? 
I have a little mantra . 
My fear grows fat on the energy I feed it . 
And if it grows very big it probably happens . 
So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome , when something you 've been worrying about wakes you up -- I see a lot of people -- and for an hour you toss and turn , it gets worse and worse , and by four o'clock you 're pinned to the pillow by a monster this big . 
The only thing to do is to get up , make a cup of tea and sit down with the fear like a child beside you . 
You 're the adult . 
The fear is the child . 
And you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants , what it needs . 
How can this be made better ? 
How can the child feel stronger ? 
And you make a plan . 
And you say , " Okay , now we 're going back to sleep . 
Half - past seven , we 're getting up and that 's what we 're going to do . " 
I had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on Sunday -- paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you . 
So I did the thing . 
I got up , made the cup of tea , sat down with it , did it all and I 'm here -- still partly paralyzed , but I 'm here . 
So that 's fear . What about anger ? 
Wherever there is injustice there 's anger . 
But anger is like gasoline , and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match , you 've got an inferno . 
But anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful . 
If we can put our anger inside an engine , it can drive us forward , it can get us through the dreadful moments and it can give us real inner power . 
And I learned this in my work with nuclear weapon policy - makers . 
Because at the beginning I was so outraged at the dangers they were exposing us to that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong . 
Totally ineffective . 
In order to develop a dialogue for change we have to deal with our anger . 
It 's okay to be angry with the thing -- the nuclear weapons in this case -- but it is hopeless to be angry with the people . 
They are human beings just like us . 
And they 're doing what they think is best . 
And that 's the basis on which we have to talk with them . 
So that 's the third one , anger . 
And it brings me to the crux of what 's going on , or what I perceive as going on , in the world today , which is that last century was top - down power . 
It was still governments telling people what to do . 
This century there 's a shift . 
It 's bottom - up or grassroots power . 
It 's like mushrooms coming through concrete . 
It 's people joining up with people , as Bundy just said , miles away to bring about change . 
And Peace Direct spotted quite early on that local people in areas of very hot conflict know what to do . 
They know best what to do . 
So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that . 
And the kind of thing they 're doing is demobilizing militias , rebuilding economies , resettling refugees , even liberating child soldiers . 
And they have to risk their lives almost every day to do this . 
And what they 've realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane , but it 's less effective than using methods that connect people with people , that rebuild . 
And I think that the U.S. military is finally beginning to get this . 
Up to now their counter - terrorism policy has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost , and if civilians get in the way , that 's written as " collateral damage . " 
And this is so infuriating and humiliating for the population of Afghanistan , that it makes the recruitment for al - Qaeda very easy , when people are so disgusted by , for example , the burning of the Koran . 
So the training of the troops has to change . 
And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change . 
The British military have always been much better at this . 
But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from , and that 's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel called Chris Hughes . 
And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf -- in Iraq actually -- and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road , screaming , yelling , furiously angry , and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified , did n't know what was going on , could n't speak Arabic . 
And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head , pointing at the ground , and he said , " Kneel . " 
And these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor , wobbled to the ground . 
And complete silence fell . 
And after about two minutes , everybody moved aside and went home . 
Now that to me is wisdom in action . 
In the moment , that 's what he did . 
And it 's happening everywhere now . 
You do n't believe me ? 
Have you asked yourselves why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed over the last 30 years ? 
Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia , East Germany , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Mali , Madagascar , Poland , the Philippines , Serbia , Slovenia , I could go on , and now Tunisia and Egypt . 
And this has n't just happened . 
A lot of it is due to a book written by an 80-year - old man in Boston , Gene Sharp . 
He wrote a book called " From Dictatorship to Democracy " with 81 methodologies for non - violent resistance . 
And it 's been translated into 26 languages . 
It 's flown around the world . 
And it 's being used by young people and older people everywhere , because it works and it 's effective . 
So this is what gives me hope -- not just hope , this is what makes me feel very positive right now . 
Because finally human beings are getting it . 
We 're getting practical , doable methodologies to answer my question : How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug ? 
We 're using the kind of skills that I 've outlined : inner power -- the development of inner power -- through self - knowledge , recognizing and working with our fear , using anger as a fuel , cooperating with others , banding together with others , courage , and most importantly , commitment to active non - violence . 
Now I do n't just believe in non - violence . 
I do n't have to believe in it . 
I see evidence everywhere of how it works . 
And I see that we , ordinary people , can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did . 
We can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known . 
And we can organize to overcome oppression by opening our hearts as well as strengthening this incredible resolve . 
And this open - heartedness is exactly what I 've experienced in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday . 
Thank you .

Ray Anderson on the business logic of sustainability 
Believe me or not , I come offering a solution to a very important part of this larger problem , with the requisite focus on climate . 
And the solution I offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere . 
That culprit is business and industry , which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956 . 
As an industrial engineer , cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur . 
After founding my company , Interface , from scratch in 1973 , 36 years ago , to produce carpet tiles in America for the business and institution markets , and shepherding it through start - up and survival to prosperity and global dominance in its field , I read Paul Hawken 's book , " The Ecology of Commerce , " the summer of 1994 . 
In his book , Paul charges business and industry as , one , the major culprit in causing the decline of the biosphere , and , two , the only institution that is large enough , and pervasive enough , and powerful enough , to really lead humankind out of this mess . 
And by the way he convicted me as a plunderer of the earth . 
And I then challenged the people of Interface , my company , to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability , which we defined as eventually operating our petroleum - intensive company in such a way as to take from the earth only what can be renewed by the earth , naturally and rapidly -- not another fresh drop of oil -- and to do no harm to the biosphere . 
Take nothing : do no harm . 
I simply said , " If Hawken is right and business and industry must lead , who will lead business and industry ? 
Unless somebody leads , nobody will . " 
It 's axiomatic . Why not us ? 
And thanks to the people of Interface , I have become a recovering plunderer . 
I once told a Fortune Magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail . 
And that became the headline of a Fortune article . 
They went on to describe me as America 's greenest CEO . 
From plunderer to recovering plunderer , to America 's greenest CEO in five years -- that , frankly , was a pretty sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 . 
Asked later in the Canadian documentary , " The Corporation , " what I meant by the " go to jail " remark , I offered that theft is a crime . 
And theft of our children 's future would someday be a crime . 
But I realized , for that to be true -- for theft of our children 's future to be a crime -- there must be a clear , demonstrable alternative to the take - make - waste industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is the major culprit , stealing our children 's future , by digging up the earth and converting it to products that quickly become waste in a landfill or an incinerator -- in short , digging up the earth and converting it to pollution . 
According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich and a well - known environmental impact equation , impact -- a bad thing -- is the product of population , affluence and technology . 
That is , impact is generated by people , what they consume in their affluence , and how it is produced . 
And though the equation is largely subjective , you can perhaps quantify people , and perhaps quantify affluence , but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify . 
So the equation is conceptual . 
Still it works to help us understand the problem . 
So we set out at Interface , in 1994 , to create an example : to transform the way we made carpet , a petroleum - intensive product for materials as well as energy , and to transform our technologies so they diminished environmental impact , rather than multiplied it . 
Paul and Anne Ehrlich 's environmental impact equation : population , affluence and technology . 
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read I equals P times A divided by T. 
Now , the mathematically - minded will see immediately that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing -- but T in the denominator decreases impact . 
So I ask , " What would move T , technology , from the numerator -- call it T1 -- where it increases impact , to the denominator -- call it T2 -- where it reduces impact ? 
I thought about the characteristics of first industrial revolution , T1 , as we practiced it at Interface , and it had the following characteristics . 
Extractive : taking raw materials from the earth . 
Linear : take , make , waste . 
Powered by fossil fuel - derived energy . 
Wasteful : abusive and focused on labor productivity . 
More carpet per man - hour . 
Thinking it through , I realized that all those attributes must be changed to move T to the denominator . 
In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste - free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity . 
And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes , and get rid of T1 altogether , we could reduce our impact to zero , including our impact on the climate . 
And that became the Interface plan in 1995 , and has been the plan ever since . 
We have measured our progress very rigorously . 
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years . 
Net greenhouse gas emissions down 82 percent in absolute tonnage . 
Over the same span of time sales have increased by two - thirds and profits have doubled . 
So an 82 percent absolute reduction translates into a 90 percent reduction in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales . 
This is the magnitude of the reduction the entire global technosphere must realize by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate disruption -- so the scientists are telling us . 
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production , due to efficiencies in renewables . 
The cheapest , most secure barrel of oil there is is the one not used through efficiencies . 
Water usage is down 75 percent in our worldwide carpet tile business . 
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business , which we acquired in 1993 right here in California , City of Industry , where water is so precious . 
Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total , and growing rapidly . 
Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total , going for 100 percent . 
We have diverted 148 million pounds -- that 's 74,000 tons -- of used carpet from landfills , closing the loop on material flows through reverse logistics and post - consumer recycling technologies that did not exist when we started 14 years ago . 
Those new cyclical technologies have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold 85 million square yards of climate - neutral carpet since 2004 , meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain , from mine and well head clear to end - of - life reclamation -- independent third - party certified . 
We call it Cool Carpet . 
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator , increasing sales and profits . 
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand Flor , misspelled F - L - O - R. 
You can point and click today at Flor.com and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days . 
It is practical , and pretty too . 
We reckon that we are a bit over halfway to our goal : zero impact , zero footprint . 
We 've set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of Mount Sustainability . 
We call this Mission Zero . 
And this is perhaps the most important facet : we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business . 
A better business model , a better way to bigger profits . 
Here is the business case for sustainability . 
From real life experience , costs are down , not up , reflecting some 400 million dollars of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste -- the first face of Mount Sustainability . 
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface . 
And this dispels a myth too , this false choice between the environment and the economy . 
Our products are the best they 've ever been , inspired by design for sustainability , an unexpected wellspring of innovation . 
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose . 
You can not beat it for attracting the best people and bringing them together . 
And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing . 
No amount of advertising , no clever marketing campaign , at any price , could have produced or created this much goodwill . 
Costs , products , people , marketplaces -- what else is there ? 
It is a better business model . 
And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits . 
There is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three - year period , were down 17 percent . 
But the marketplace was down 36 percent . 
We literally gained market share . 
We might not have survived that recession but for the advantages of sustainability . 
If every business were pursuing Interface plans , would that solve all our problems ? 
I do n't think so . 
I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation , I equals P times A divided by T2 . 
That A is a capital A , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself . 
But what if we reframed Ehrlich further ? 
And what if we made A a lowercase ' a , ' suggesting that it is a means to an end , and that end is happiness -- more happiness with less stuff . 
You know that would reframe civilization itself -- -- and our whole system of economics , if not for our species , then perhaps for the one that succeeds us : the sustainable species , living on a finite earth , ethically , happily and ecologically in balance with nature and all her natural systems for a thousand generations , or 10,000 generations -- that is to say , into the indefinite future . 
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species ? 
Well maybe so . But I do n't think so . 
At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical sustainable , zero - footprint industrial company fully into existence by 2020 . 
We can see our way now , clear to the top of that mountain . 
And now the challenge is in execution . 
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says , " If something exists , it must be possible . " 
If we can actually do it , it must be possible . 
If we , a petro - intensive company can do it , anybody can . 
And if anybody can , it follows that everybody can . 
Hawken fulfilled business and industry , leading humankind away from the abyss because , with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere , a very dear person is at risk here -- frankly , an unacceptable risk . 
Who is that person ? 
Not you . Not I. 
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here . 
And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb . 
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996 , I was talking to people , as I did at every opportunity back then , bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting . 
But about five days later back in Atlanta , I received an email from Glenn Thomas , one of my people in the California meeting . 
He was sending me an original poem that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together . 
And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life . 
Because it told me , by God , one person got it . 
Here is what Glenn wrote . And here is that person , most at risk . 
Please meet " Tomorrow 's Child . " 
" Without a name , an unseen face , and knowing not your time or place , Tomorrow 's child , though yet unborn , I met you first last Tuesday morn . 
A wise friend introduced us two . 
And through his sobering point of view I saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me . 
Knowing you has changed my thinking . 
For I never had an inkling that perhaps the things I do might someday , somehow threaten you . 
Tomorrow 's child , my daughter , son , I 'm afraid I 've just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known I should . 
Begin , I will . 
The way the cost of what I squander , what is lost , if ever I forget that you will someday come and live here too . " 
Well , every day of my life since , " Tomorrow 's Child " has spoken to me with one simple but profound message , which I presume to share with you . 
We are , each and every one , a part of the web of life . 
The continuum of humanity , sure , but in a larger sense , the web of life itself . 
And we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it . 
For you , it 's your call . 
Thank you .

Arts administrator and live - theater fan Ben Cameron looks at the state of the live arts -- asking : How can the magic of live theater , live music , live dance compete with the always - on Internet ? At TEDxYYC , he offers a bold look forward .

Ben Cameron : The true power of the performing arts 
I am a cultural omnivore , one whose daily commute is made possible by attachment to an iPod -- an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart , pop diva Christina Aguilera , country singer Josh Turner , gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin , concerti , symphonies and more and more . 
I 'm a voracious reader , a reader who deals with Ian McEwan down to Stephanie Meyer . 
I have read the " Twilight " tetralogy . 
And one who lives for my home theater , a home theater where I devour DVDs , video - on - demand and a lot of television . 
For me , " Law and Order : SVU , " Tine Fey and " 30 Rock " and " Judge Judy " -- " The people are real , the cases are real , the rulings are final . " 
Now , I 'm convinced a lot of you probably share my passions , especially my passion for Judge Judy , and you 'd fight anybody who attempted to take her away from us , but I 'm a little less convinced that you share the central passion of my life , a passion for the live professional performing arts , performing arts that represent the orchestral repertoire , yes , but jazz as well , modern dance , opera , theater and more and more and more . 
You know , frankly it 's a sector that many of us who work in the field worry is being endangered and possibly dismantled by technology . 
While we initially heralded the Internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the Internet is , if anything , too effective in that regard . 
Depending on who you read , an arts organization or an artist , who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer , now competes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day . 
We now know in fact that technology is our biggest competitor for leisure time . 
Five years ago , Gen - X'ers spent 20.7 hours online and TV , the majority on TV . 
Gen - Y'ers spent even more -- 23.8 hours , the majority online . 
And now , a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent 20,000 hours online and an additional 10,000 hours playing video games -- a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined . 
Moreover , we 're afraid that technology has altered our very assumptions of cultural consumption . 
Thanks to the Internet , we believe we can get anything we want whenever we want it , delivered to our own doorstep . 
We can shop at three in the morning or eight at night , ordering jeans tailor - made for our unique body - types . 
Expectations of personalization and customization that the live performing arts -- which have set curtain times , set venues , attendant inconveniences of travel , parking and the like -- simply can not meet . 
And we 're all acutely aware : what 's it going to mean in the future when we ask someone to pay a hundred dollars for a symphony , opera or ballet ticket , when that cultural consumer is used to downloading on the internet 24 hours a day for 99 cents a song or for free ? 
These are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain . 
But as particular as they feel to us , we know we 're not alone . 
All of us are engaged in a seismic , fundamental realignment of culture and communications , a realignment that is shaking and decimating the newspaper industry , the magazine industry , the book and publishing industry and more . 
Saddled in the performing arts as we are , by antiquated union agreements that inhibit and often prohibit mechanical reproduction and streaming , locked into large facilities that were designed to ossify the ideal relationship between artist and audience most appropriate to the 19th century and locked into a business model dependent on high ticket revenues , where we charge exorbitant prices . 
Many of us shudder in the wake of the collapse of Tower Records and ask ourselves , " Are we next ? " 
Everyone I talk to in performing arts resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich , who , in " Dreams of a Common Language , " wrote , " We are out in a country that has no language , no laws . 
Whatever we do together is pure invention . 
The maps they gave us are out of date by years . " 
And for those of you who love the arts , are n't you glad you invited me here to brighten your day ? 
Now , rather than saying that we 're on the brink of our own annihilation , I prefer to believe that we are engaged in a fundamental reformation , a reformation like the religious Reformation of the 16th century . 
The arts reformation , like the religious Reformation , is spurred in part by technology , with indeed , the printing press really leading the charge on the religious Reformation . 
Both reformations were predicated on fractious discussion , internal self - doubt and massive realignment of antiquated business models . 
And at heart , both reformations , I think were asking the questions : who 's entitled to practice ? 
How are they entitled to practice ? 
And indeed , do we need anyone to intermediate for us in order to have an experience with a spiritual divine ? 
Chris Anderson , someone I trust you all know , editor - in - chief of Wired magazine and author of " The Long Tail , " really was the first -- for me -- to nail a lot of this . 
He wrote a long time ago , you know , thanks to the invention of the Internet , web technology , mini - cams and more , the means of artistic production have been democratized for the first time in all of human history . 
In the 1930s , if any of you wanted to make a movie , you had to work for Warner Brothers or RKO because who could afford a movie set and lighting equipment and editing equipment and scoring and more ? 
And now who in this room does n't know a 14 year - old hard at work on her second , third , or fourth movie ? 
Similarly , the means of artistic distribution have been democratized for the first time in human history . 
Again , in the ' 30s , Warner Brothers , RKO did that for you . 
Now , go to YouTube , Facebook ; you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom . 
This double impact is occasioning a massive redefinition of the cultural market , a time when anyone is a potential author . 
Frankly , what we 're seeing now in this environment is a massive time , when the entire world is changing as we move from a time when audience numbers are plummeting . 
But the number of arts participants , people who write poetry , who sing songs , who perform in church choirs , is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations . 
This group , others have called the " pro ams , " amateur artists doing work at a professional level . 
You see them on YouTube , in dance competitions , film festivals and more . 
They are radically expanding our notions of the potential of an aesthetic vocabulary , while they are challenging and undermining the cultural autonomy of our traditional institutions . 
Ultimately , we now live in a world defined not by consumption , but by participation . 
But I want to be clear , just as the religious Reformation did not spell the end to the formal Church or to the priesthood ; I believe that our artistic institutions will continue to have importance . 
They currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity -- not opulence -- of dignity . 
And they are the places where artists who deserve and want to work at a certain scale of resources will find a home . 
But to view them as synonymous with the entirety of the arts community is , by far , too short - sighted . 
And indeed , while we 've tended to polarize the amateur from the professional , the single most exciting development in the last five to 10 years has been the rise of the professional hybrid artist , the professional artist who works , not primarily in the concert hall or on the stage ; but most frequently around women 's rights , or human rights , or on global warming issues or AIDS relief for more -- not out of economic necessity , but out of a deep , organic conviction that the work that she or he , is called to do can not be accomplished in the traditional hermetic arts environment . 
Today 's dance world is not defined solely by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet or the National Ballet of Canada , but by Liz Lerman 's Dance Exchange -- a multi - generational , professional dance company , whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82 , and who work with genomic scientists to embody the DNA strand and with nuclear physicists at CERN . 
Today 's professional theater community is defined , not only the Shaw and Stratford Festivals , but by the Cornerstone Theater of Los Angeles -- a collective of artists that after 9/11 , brought together 10 different religious communities -- the Bahia , the Catholic , the Muslim , the Jewish , even the Native American and the gay and lesbian communities of faith , helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play , where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross - community healing . 
Today 's performers , like Rhodessa Jones , work in women 's prisons , helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration , while today 's playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more . 
And indeed , I think , rather than being annihilated , the performing arts are posed on the brink of a time when we will be more important than we have ever been . 
You know , we 've said for a long time , we are critical to the health of the economic communities in your town . 
And absolutely -- I hope you know that every dollar spent on a performing arts ticket in a community generates five to seven additional dollars for the local economy , dollars spent in restaurants or on parking , at the fabric stores where we buy fabric for costumes , the piano tuner who tunes the instruments and more . 
But the arts are going to be more important to economies as we go forward , especially in industries we ca n't even imagine yet , just as they have been central to the iPod and the computer game industries , which few , if any of us come have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago . 
Business leadership will depend more and more on emotional intelligence , the ability to listen deeply , to have empathy , to articulate change , to motivate others -- the very capacities that the arts cultivate with every encounter . 
Especially now , as we all must confront the fallacy of a market - only orientation , uninformed by social conscience ; we must seize and celebrate the power of the arts to shape our individual and national characters , and especially characters of the young people , who all too often , are subjected to bombardment of sensation , rather than digested experience . 
Ultimately , especially now in this world , where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws , in reality TV that thrives on humiliation , and in a context of analysis , where the thing we hear most repeatedly , day - in , day - out in the United States , in every train station , every bus station , every plane station is , " Ladies and gentlemen , please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you , " when all of these ways we are encouraged to view our fellow human being with hostility and fear and contempt and suspicion . 
The arts , whatever they do , whenever they call us together , invite us to look at our fellow human being with generosity and curiosity . 
God knows , if we ever needed that capacity in human history , we need it now . 
You know , we 're bound together , not , I think by technology , entertainment and design , but by common cause . 
We work to promote healthy vibrant societies , to ameliorate human suffering , to promote a more thoughtful , substantive , empathic world order . 
I salute all of you as activists in that quest and urge you to embrace and hold dear the arts in your work , whatever your purpose may be . 
I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come . 
And I thank you for your kindness and your patience in listening to me this afternoon . 
Thank you , and godspeed .

Ahn Trio : A modern take on piano , violin , cello 
Angella Ahn : Thank you . 
Thank you so much . 
We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen , sharing our music with you . 
What an exciting and inspiring event . 
What you just heard is " Skylife " by David Balakrishnan . 
We want to play you one more selection . 
It 's by Astor Piazzolla , an Argentine composer . 
And we talk about different ideas -- he had this idea that he thought music should be from the heart . 
This was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart , beautiful music , was n't the most popular thing in the classical music world . 
It was more atonal and twelve - tone . 
And he insisted on beautiful music . 
So this is " Oblivion " by Astor Piazzolla . 
Thank you .

Bill Strickland makes change with a slide show 
It 's a great honor to be here with you . 
The good news is I 'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here because I 'm the only thing standing between you and the bar . 
And the good news is I do n't have a prepared speech , but I have a box of slides . 
I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living . 
I 've learned through experience that people remember pictures long after they 've forgotten words , and so I hope you 'll remember some of the pictures I 'm going to share with you for just a few minutes . 
The whole story really starts with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead . 
And on a Wednesday afternoon , I was walking down the corridor of my high school kind of minding my own business . And there was this artist teaching , who made a great big old ceramic vessel , and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room -- and if you 've ever seen clay done , it 's magic -- and I 'd never seen anything like that before in my life . 
So , I walked in the art room and I said , " What is that ? " 
And he said , " Ceramics . And who are you ? " 
And I said , " I 'm Bill Strickland . I want you to teach me that . " 
And he said , " Well , get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper that says you can come here , and I 'll teach it to you . " 
And so for the remaining two years of my high school , I cut all my classes . 
But I had the presence of mind to give the teachers ' classes that I cut the pottery that I made , and they gave me passing grades . 
And that 's how I got out of high school . 
And Mr. Ross said , " You 're too smart to die and I do n't want it on my conscience , so I 'm leaving this school and I 'm taking you with me . " 
And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh where I filled out a college application and got in on probation . 
Well , I 'm now a trustee of the university , and at my installation ceremony I said , " I 'm the guy who came from the neighborhood who got into the place on probation . 
Do n't give up on the poor kids , because you never know what 's going to happen to those children in life . " 
What I 'm going to show you for a couple of minutes is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh with the highest crime rate . 
One is called Bidwell Training Center ; it is a vocational school for ex - steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers . 
You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh ? 
Well , we do n't make any steel anymore , and the people who used to make the steel are having a very tough time of it . 
And I rebuild them and give them new life . 
Manchester Craftsmen 's Guild is named after my neighborhood . 
I was adopted by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots , and he donated a row house . And in that row house I started Manchester Craftsmen 's Guild , and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians , there 's money in very close proximity . 
And the Bishop adopted me as his kid . 
And last year I spoke at his memorial service and wished him well in this life . 
I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright , the architect , and I asked him to build me a world class center in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh . 
And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport . 
And when you come to Pittsburgh -- and you 're all invited -- you 'll be flying into the blown - up version of my building . 
That 's the building . 
Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead . 
My view is that if you want to involve yourself in the life of people who have been given up on , you have to look like the solution and not the problem . 
As you can see , it has a fountain in the courtyard . 
And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one and I had the checkbook , so I bought one and put it there . 
And now that I 'm giving speeches at conferences like TED , I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum . 
At a reception in their courtyard , I noticed that they had a fountain because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain . 
Well , I think that welfare mothers and at - risk kids and ex - steel workers deserve a fountain in their life . 
And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility -- and it sets an attitude and expectation about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech . 
So , from that fountain I built this building . 
As you can see , it has world class art , and it 's all my taste because I raised all the money . 
I said to my boy , " When you raise the money , we 'll put your taste on the wall . " 
That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns , there 's something beautiful looking back at you , that 's deliberate . 
That 's intentional . 
In my view , it is this kind of world that can redeem the soul of poor people . 
We also created a boardroom , and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto , Japan , and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building . 
We have since spun him off into his own business . 
He 's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people . 
And I got 60 pieces out of it for my school because I felt that welfare moms and ex - steel workers and single parents deserved to come to a school where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day . 
Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people long before you give them the speech . 
We even have flowers in the hallway , and they 're not plastic . 
Those are real and they 're in my building every day . 
And now that I 've given lots of speeches , we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me , and they said , " Mr. Strickland , what an extraordinary story and what a great school . 
And we were particularly touched by the flowers and we were curious as to how the flowers got there . " 
I said , " Well , I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there . " 
You do n't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids . 
What you need to know is that the children and the adults deserve flowers in their life . 
The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge . 
And so in my building , which is full of sunlight and full of flowers , we believe in hope and human possibilities . 
That happens to be at Christmas time . 
And so the next thing you 'll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the Heinz company -- you 've heard of them ? 
They did all right in the ketchup business . 
And I happen to know that company pretty well because John Heinz , who was our U.S. senator -- who was tragically killed in a plane accident -- he had heard about my desire to build a new building , because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site . 
And he called me into his office -- which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz -- and John Heinz had 600 million dollars , and at the time I had about 60 cents . 
And he said , " But we 've heard about you . 
We 've heard about your work with the kids and the ex - steel workers , and we 're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building . 
And you could do us a great service if you would add a culinary program to your program . " 
Because back then , we were building a trades program . 
He said , " That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals for the Heinz company . " 
I said , " Senator , I 'm reluctant to go into a field that I do n't know much about , but I promise you that if you 'll support my school , I 'll get it built and in a couple of years , I 'll come back and weigh out that program that you desire . " 
And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said , " Well , what would your reaction be if I said I 'd give you a million dollars ? " 
I said , " Senator , it appears that we 're going into the food training business . " 
And John Heinz did give me a million bucks . 
And most importantly , he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company . 
And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America , which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools , and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city . 
And we 've never looked back . 
I would like to show you now some of the food that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen . 
That happens to be our cafeteria line . 
That 's puff pastry day . Why ? 
Because the students made puff pastry and that 's what the school ate every day . 
But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food . 
That good food 's not for rich people -- good food 's for everybody on the planet , and there 's no excuse why we all ca n't be eating it . 
So at my school , we subsidize a gourmet lunch program for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city because we 've discovered that it 's good for their stomachs , but it 's better for their heads . 
Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life that they have value at this place I call my center . 
We have students who sit together , black kids and white kids , and what we 've discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment , because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way . 
These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing after six months in the training program . 
No sophistication , no class , no dignity , no history . 
What we 've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people is they do n't have any money , which happens to be a curable condition . 
It 's all in the way that you think about people that often determines their behavior . 
That was done by a student after seven months in the program , done by a very brilliant young woman who was taught by our pastry chef . 
I 've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they 're very good . 
They have no calories . 
That 's our dining room . 
It looks like your average high school cafeteria in your average town in America . 
But this is my view of how students ought to be treated , particularly once they have been pushed aside . 
We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry , we train medical technicians for the medical industry , and we train chemical technicians for companies like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon . 
And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh -- and you 're all invited -- you 'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry with logarithmic calculators 10 months from enrolling in the program . 
There is absolutely no reason why poor people ca n't learn world class technology . 
What we 've discovered is you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie 's music , and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time . 
We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry . 
We even teach people how to read . 
The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago -- he 's now an instructor . 
And I have children with high school diplomas that they ca n't read . 
And so you must ask yourself the question : how is it possible in the 21st century that we graduate children from schools who ca n't read the diplomas that they have in their hands ? 
The reason is that the system gets reimbursed for the kids they spit out the other end , not the children who read . 
I can take these children and in 20 weeks , demonstrated aptitude ; I can get them high school equivalent . 
No big deal . 
That 's our library with more handcrafted furniture . 
And this is the arts program I started in 1968 . 
Remember I 'm the black kid from the ' 60s who got his life saved with ceramics . 
Well , I went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood , the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm , you can bring them right back to life . 
I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system that come to me every day of the week for arts education . 
And these are children who are flunking out of public school . 
And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college and I 've averaged over 80 percent for 15 years . 
We 've made a fascinating discovery : there 's nothing wrong with the kids that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm and Herbie 's music ca n't cure . 
For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education . 
I beat out all the Ph.D. 's because I figured that if you treat children like human beings , it increases the likelihood they 're going to behave that way . 
And why we ca n't institute that policy in every school and in every city and every town remains a mystery to me . 
Let me show you what these people do . 
We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging . 
And these are all kids with no artistic ability , no talent , no imagination . And we bring in the world 's greatest artists -- Gordon Parks has been there , Chester Higgins has been there -- and what we 've learned is that the children will become like the people who teach them . 
In fact , I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican , an African - American woman who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques , and let me show you what they did with the work . 
These were children who the whole world had given up on , who were flunking out of public school , and that 's what they 're capable of doing with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence . 
We teach photography . 
And these are examples of some of the kids ' work . 
That boy won a four - year scholarship on the strength of that photograph . 
This is our gallery . 
We have a world class gallery because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery , so I designed this thing . 
We have smoked salmon at the art openings , we have a formal printed invitation , and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come . 
I could n't buy a parent 15 years ago so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time . 
He was dragging guys out of bars and saving those lives for the Lord . 
And I said , " Bill , I want to hire you , man . 
You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit , but keep the enthusiasm . 
I ca n't get these parents to come to the school . " 
He said , " I 'll get them to come to the school . " 
So , he jumped in the van , he went to Miss Jones ' house and said , " Miss Jones , I knew you wanted to come to your kid 's art opening but you probably did n't have a ride . 
So , I came to give you a ride . " 
And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents . 
At the last show that we did , 200 parents showed up and we did n't pick up one parent . 
Because now it 's become socially not acceptable not to show up to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen 's Guild because people think you 're bad parents . 
And there is no statistical difference between the white parents and the black parents . 
Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated , every time , every town , every city . 
I wanted you to see this gallery because it 's as good as it gets . 
And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school , they 've got four shows on their resume before they apply to college because it 's all up here . 
You have to change the way that people see themselves before you can change their behavior . 
And it 's worked out pretty good up to this day . 
I even stuck another room on the building , which I 'd like to show you . 
This is brand new . 
We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference . 
I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley and I did all right . 
And the woman came out of the audience , she said , " That was a great story and I was very impressed with your presentation . 
My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old . " 
And I said , " Well , what do you do for a living ? " 
She said , " Well , I work for a company called Hewlett - Packard . " 
And I said , " You 're in the computer business , is that right ? " 
She said , " Yes , sir . " 
And I said , " Well , there 's an easy solution to that problem . " 
Well , I 'm very pleased to announce to you that HP and a furniture company called Steelcase have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology and all their furniture for the United States of America . 
And that 's the room that 's initiating the relationship . 
We got it just done in time to show you , so it 's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center . 
I only have a couple more slides , and this is where the story gets kind of interesting . 
So , I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes and you 'll understand why he 's there and I 'm here . 
In 1986 , I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall on the north end of the building while I was building it . 
And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there because he knew this man over here , Marty Ashby . 
And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check on a Wednesday afternoon , and I said , " Dizzy , why would you come to a black - run center in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate that does n't even have a reputation in music ? " 
He said , " Because I heard you built the center and I did n't believe that you did it , and I wanted to see for myself . 
And now that I have , I want to give you a gift . " 
I said , " You 're the gift . " 
He said , " No , sir . You 're the gift . 
And I 'm going to allow you to record the concert and I 'm going to give you the music , and if you ever choose to sell it , you must sign an agreement that says the money will come back and support the school . " 
And I recorded Dizzy . And he died a year later , but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing . 
And he showed up and said , " Dizzy talking about you all over the country , man , and I want to help you . " 
And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up . 
Then a bass player named Ray Brown , and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine , and a piano player named Herbie Hancock , and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra , and a fellow named Tito Puente , and a guy named Gary Burton , and Shirley Horn , and Betty Carter , and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city . 
And I 'm very pleased to tell you that , with their permission , I have now accumulated 600 recordings of the greatest artists in the world , including Joe Williams , who died , but not before his last recording was done at my school . 
And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said , " God 's picked you , man , to do this work . 
And I want my music to be with you . " 
And that worked out all right . 
When the Basie band came , the band got so excited about the school they voted to give me the rights to the music . 
And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy . 
And like a fool , I did n't go to the ceremony because I did n't think we were going to win . 
Well , we did win , and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden . 
Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back . 
So , we 've become one of the hot , young jazz recording studios in the United States of America in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate . 
That 's the place all filled up with Republicans . 
If you 'd have dropped a bomb on that room , you 'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania because it was all sitting there . 
Including my mother and father , who lived long enough to see their kid build that building . 
And there 's Dizzy , just like I told you . He was there . 
And he was there , Tito Puente . 
And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there and they recorded with us . 
And that was our first recording studio , which was the broom closet . 
We put the mops in the hallway and re - engineered the thing and that 's where we recorded the first Grammy . 
And this is our new facility , which is all video technology . 
And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson , who recorded that album at our school last Christmas . 
And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey on Christmas Day , he was there and Nancy was there singing excerpts from this album , the rights to which she donated to our school . 
And I can now tell you with absolute certainty that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs . 
We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts , right behind Tony Bennett . 
And I think we 're going to be fine . 
This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building -- and so I had another cardboard box built and I walked back out in the streets again . 
And that 's the building , and that 's the model , and on the right 's a high - tech greenhouse and in the middle 's the medical technology building . 
And I 'm very pleased to tell you that the building 's done . 
It 's also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot -- triple that in the middle of the inner city . 
And there 's the fountain . 
Every building has a fountain . 
And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants and they took half the building , and we now train medical technicians through all their system . 
And Mellon Bank 's a tenant . 
And I love them because they pay the rent on time . 
And as a result of the association , I 'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation that bought Dreyfus . 
And this is in the process of being built as we speak . 
Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse that 's going to open in October this year because we 're going to grow those flowers in the middle of the inner city . 
And we 're going to have high school kids growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city . 
And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states . 
And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu , California , who are Hispanic . 
So , the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city . 
And I told my United States senator that there was a very high probability that if he could find some funding for this , we would become a left - hand column in the Wall Street Journal , to which he readily agreed . 
And we got the funding and we open in the fall . 
And you ought to come and see it -- it 's going to be a hell of a story . 
And this is what I want to do when I grow up . 
The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at and I 'll tell you where I made my big mistake . 
I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park -- which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront -- for four million dollars and I did n't do it . 
And I built the first building , and guess what happened ? 
I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody 's expectations and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year , and said , " Mr. Strickland , you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award because you 've appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations . 
Thank you very much for that . " 
The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams , just in case they do come true . 
And finally , there 's this picture . 
This is in a place called San Francisco . 
And the reason this picture 's in here is I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit , and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me . 
He said , " Man , that 's a great story . 
I want one of those . " 
I said , " Well , I 'm very flattered . What do you do for a living ? " 
He says , " I run the city of San Francisco . 
My name 's Willie Brown . " 
And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise and put it out of my mind . 
And that weekend , I was going back home and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night -- first time I 'd met him . 
And he walked in and he says , " What is this ? " 
And I said , " Herbie , this is my concept of a training center for poor people . " 
And he said , " As God as my witness , I 've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you 've built it . 
And now I really want to build one . " 
I said , " Well , where would you build this thing ? " 
He said , " San Francisco . " 
I said , " Any chance you know Willie Brown ? " 
As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown , and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago , and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth . 
And Willie Brown said , " As sure as I 'm the mayor of San Francisco , I 'm going to build this thing as a legacy to the poor people of this city . " 
And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay and we got an architect and we got a general contractor and we got Herbie on the board , and our friends from HP , and our friends from Steelcase , and our friends from Cisco , and our friends from Wells Fargo and Genentech . 
And along the way , I met this real short guy at my slide show in the Silicon Valley . 
He came up to me afterwards , he said , " Man , that 's a fabulous story . 
I want to help you . " 
And I said , " Well , thank you very much for that . 
What do you do for a living ? " 
He said , " Well , I built a company called eBay . " 
I said , " Well , that 's very nice . 
Thanks very much , and give me your card and sometime we 'll talk . " 
I did n't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano , but I had the presence of mind to go back and talk to one of the techie kids at my center . 
I said , " Hey man , what is eBay ? " 
He said , " Well , that 's the electronic commerce network . " 
I said , " Well , I met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card . " 
So , I called him up on the phone and I said , " Mr. Skoll , I 've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are and I 'd like to become your friend . " 
And Jeff and I did become friends , and he 's organized a team of people and we 're going to build this center . 
And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview - Hunters Point , and I said , " The mayor sent me down here to work with you and I want to build a center with you , but I 'm not going to build you anything if you do n't want it . 
And all I 've got is a box of slides . " 
And so I stood up in front of 200 very angry , very disappointed people on a summer night , and the air conditioner had broken and it was 100 degrees outside , and I started showing these pictures . 
And after about 10 pictures they all settled down . 
And I ran the story and I said , " What do you think ? " 
And in the back of the room , a woman stood up and she said , " In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place , you 're the only person that 's come down here and treated us with dignity . 
I 'm going with you , man . " 
And she turned that audience around on a pin . 
And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing , and we 're going to build it all right . 
And I think we can get in the ground this year as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh . 
But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way and I showed him the box of slides . 
And Quincy said , " I want to help you , man . 
Let 's do one in L.A. " 
And so he 's assembled a group of people . 
And I 've fallen in love with him , as I have with Herbie and with his music . 
And Quincy said , " Where did the idea for centers like this come from ? " 
And I said , " It came from your music , man . 
Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums when I was 16 years old in the pottery class , when the world was all dark , and your music got me to the sunlight . " 
And I said , " If I can follow that music , I 'll get out into the sunlight and I 'll be OK . 
And if that 's not true , how did I get here ? " 
I want you all to know that I think the world is a place that 's worth living . 
I believe in you . 
I believe in your hopes and your dreams , I believe in your intelligence and I believe in your enthusiasm . 
And I 'm tired of living like this , going into town after town with people standing around on corners with holes where eyes used to be , their spirits damaged . 
We wo n't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around . 
In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail , most of whom look like me . 
It 's 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School . 
It 's 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail . 
Do the math -- it will never work . 
I am banking on you and I 'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard and very decent people who still believe in something . 
And I want to do this in my lifetime , in every city and in every town . 
And I do n't think I 'm crazy . 
I think we can get home on this thing and I think we can build these all over the country for less money than we 're spending on prisons . 
And I believe we can turn this whole story around to one of celebration and one of hope . 
In my business it 's very difficult work . 
You 're always fighting upstream like a salmon -- never enough money , too much need -- and so there is a tendency to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work . 
And so I 've figured out , over time , the solution to the depression : you make a friend in every town and you 'll never be lonely . 
And my hope is that I 've made a few here tonight . 
And thanks for listening to what I had to say .

Sheila Nirenberg : A prosthetic eye to treat blindness 
I study how the brain processes information . That is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and converts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things -- to see , hear , to reach for an object . 
So I 'm really a basic scientist , not a clinician , but in the last year and a half I 've started to switch over , to use what we 've been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices , and what I wanted to do today is show you an example of this . 
It 's really our first foray into this . 
It 's the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness . 
So let me start in on that problem . 
There are 10 million people in the U.S. 
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina , diseases like macular degeneration , and there 's little that can be done for them . 
There are some drug treatments , but they 're only effective on a small fraction of the population . And so , for the vast majority of patients , their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices . 
The problem is that current prosthetics do n't work very well . They 're still very limited in the vision that they can provide . 
And so , you know , for example , with these devices , patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges , not very much more , so nothing close to normal vision has been possible . 
So what I 'm going to tell you about today is a device that we 've been working on that I think has the potential to make a difference , to be much more effective , and what I wanted to do is show you how it works . Okay , so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve . 
Here you have a retina . 
So you have an image , a retina , and a brain . 
So when you look at something , like this image of this baby 's face , it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina , on the front - end cells here , the photoreceptors . 
Then what happens is the retinal circuitry , the middle part , goes to work on it , and what it does is it performs operations on it , it extracts information from it , and it converts that information into a code . 
And the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain , and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code . And when I say code , I do literally mean code . 
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means " baby 's face , " and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses , it knows that what was out there was a baby 's face , and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was , say , a dog , or another pattern would be a house . 
Anyway , you get the idea . 
And , of course , in real life , it 's all dynamic , meaning that it 's changing all the time , so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you 're looking at is changing all the time too . 
So , you know , it 's sort of a complicated thing . You have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you 're seeing . 
So what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration ? What happens is is that , the front - end cells die , the photoreceptors die , and over time , all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them , they die too . 
Until the only things that you have left are these cells here , the output cells , the ones that send the signals to the brain , but because of all that degeneration they are n't sending any signals anymore . 
They are n't getting any input , so the person 's brain no longer gets any visual information -- that is , he or she is blind . 
So , a solution to the problem , then , would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front - end circuitry and send signals to the retina 's output cells , and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain . 
So this is what we 've been working on , and this is what our prosthetic does . 
So it consists of two parts , what we call an encoder and a transducer . 
And so the encoder does just what I was saying : it mimics the actions of the front - end circuitry -- so it takes images in and converts them into the retina 's code . 
And then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain , and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce normal retinal output . 
So a completely blind retina , even one with no front - end circuitry at all , no photoreceptors , can now send out normal signals , signals that the brain can understand . 
So no other device has been able to do this . 
Okay , so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it 's doing , because it 's really the key part and it 's sort of interesting and kind of cool . 
I 'm not sure " cool " is really the right word , but you know what I mean . 
So what it 's doing is , it 's replacing the retinal circuitry , really the guts of the retinal circuitry , with a set of equations , a set of equations that we can implement on a chip . So it 's just math . 
In other words , we 're not literally replacing the components of the retina . 
It 's not like we 're making a little mini - device for each of the different cell types . 
We 've just abstracted what the retina 's doing with a set of equations . 
And so , in a way , the equations are serving as sort of a codebook . An image comes in , goes through the set of equations , and out comes streams of electrical pulses , just like a normal retina would produce . 
Now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output , and what the implications of this are . 
Here are three sets of firing patterns . The top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that 's been treated with this encoder - transducer device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic . 
So the bottom one is the state - of - the - art device that 's out there right now , which is basically made up of light detectors , but no encoder . So what we did was we presented movies of everyday things -- people , babies , park benches , you know , regular things happening -- and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals . 
Now just to orient you , each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells , and just as in the previous slides , each row is a different cell , and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so I could show you a long stretch of data . 
So as you can see , the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder - transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns -- and it 's not perfect , but it 's pretty good -- and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic , the responses really do n't . 
And so with the standard method , the cells do fire , they just do n't fire in the normal firing patterns because they do n't have the right code . 
How important is this ? 
What 's the potential impact on a patient 's ability to see ? 
So I 'm just going to show you one bottom - line experiment that answers this , and of course I 've got a lot of other data , so if you 're interested I 'm happy to show more . So the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment . 
So what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked , what was the retina seeing at that moment ? 
Can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns ? 
So , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer . 
So let me show you , and I 'm going to start with the standard method first . 
So you can see that it 's pretty limited , and because the firing patterns are n't in the right code , they 're very limited in what they can tell you about what 's out there . So you can see that there 's something there , but it 's not so clear what that something is , and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning , that with the standard method , patients can see high - contrast edges , they can see light , but it does n't easily go further than that . So what was the image ? It was a baby 's face . 
So what about with our approach , adding the code ? And you can see that it 's much better . Not only can you tell that it 's a baby 's face , but you can tell that it 's this baby 's face , which is a really challenging task . 
So on the left is the encoder alone , and on the right is from an actual blind retina , so the encoder and the transducer . 
But the key one really is the encoder alone , because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer . 
This is just actually the first one that we tried . 
I just wanted to say something about the standard method . 
When this first came out , it was just a really exciting thing , the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all . 
But there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution . 
Now I just want to wrap up , and as I was mentioning earlier of course I have a lot of other data if you 're interested , but I just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language , and the potential power of being able to do that . 
So it 's different from the motor prosthetics where you 're communicating from the brain to a device . Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood , and be understood by the brain . 
And then the last thing I wanted to say , really , is to emphasize that the idea generalizes . 
So the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas , for example , the auditory system and the motor system , so for treating deafness and for motor disorders . 
So just the same way that we were able to jump over the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina 's output cells , we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve , or jump over damaged areas in the cortex , in the motor cortex , to bridge the gap produced by a stroke . 
I just want to end with a simple message that understanding the code is really , really important , and if we can understand the code , the language of the brain , things become possible that did n't seem obviously possible before . Thank you .

Bonnie Bassler on how bacteria " talk " 
Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth . 
They 've been here for billions of years , and what they are are single - celled microscopic organisms . 
So they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA . 
They have very few genes , and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out . 
And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on . 
They just grow and divide , and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life , except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters . 
I know you guys think of yourself as humans , and this is sort of how I think of you . 
This man is supposed to represent a generic human being , and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body . 
There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do , but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life . 
So , 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being . 
And of course it 's the DNA that counts , so here 's all the A , T , Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code , and give you all your charming characteristics . 
You have about 30,000 genes . 
Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life . 
At the best , you 're 10 percent human , but more likely about one percent human , depending on which of these metrics you like . 
I know you think of yourself as human beings , but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial . 
These bacteria are not passive riders , these are incredibly important , they keep us alive . 
They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy . 
They digest our food , they make our vitamins , they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out . 
So they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive , and they never get any press for that . 
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well . 
So , there 's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time , and if they are , they make you incredibly sick . 
And so , the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do , or all the bad things that bacteria do . 
The question we had is how could they do anything at all ? 
I mean they 're incredibly small , you have to have a microscope to see one . 
They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide , and they 've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms . 
And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals . 
And so we wanted to think if there could n't be a different way that bacteria live . 
The clue to this came from another marine bacterium , and it 's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri . 
What you 're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium , a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean , named Vibrio fischeri . 
This bacterium has the special property that it makes light , so it makes bioluminescence , like fireflies make light . 
We 're not doing anything to the cells here . 
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room , and this is what we see . 
What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light , but when the bacteria made light . 
What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone , so when they were in dilute suspension , they made no light . 
But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously . 
The question that we had is how can bacteria , these primitive organisms , tell the difference from times when they 're alone , and times when they 're in a community , and then all do something together . 
What we 've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other , and they talk with a chemical language . 
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell . 
When it 's alone it does n't make any light . 
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones , and these are the red triangles , and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light . 
But when the bacteria grow and double and they 're all participating in making these molecules , the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number . 
And when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are , they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony . 
That 's how bioluminescence works -- they 're talking with these chemical words . 
The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology . 
Again , another plug for the animals in the ocean , Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid . 
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid , and it 's been turned on its back , and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells , they live in there , at high cell number that molecule is there , and they 're making light . 
The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light . 
The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii , just in sort of shallow knee - deep water . 
The squid is nocturnal , so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps , but then at night it has to come out to hunt . 
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in , since it 's just in those couple feet of water . 
What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria . 
Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back . 
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid 's back , so the squid does n't make a shadow . 
It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter - illuminate itself in an anti - predation device so predators ca n't see its shadow , calculate its trajectory , and eat it . 
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean . 
But then if you think about it , the squid has this terrible problem because it 's got this dying , thick culture of bacteria and it ca n't sustain that . 
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep , it buries itself in the sand , and it 's got a pump that 's attached to its circadian rhythm , and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria . 
Now the bacteria are dilute , that little hormone molecule is gone , so they 're not making light -- but of course the squid does n't care . It 's asleep in the sand . 
And as the day goes by the bacteria double , they release the molecule , and then light comes on at night , exactly when the squid wants it . 
First we figured out how this bacterium does this , but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what 's the mechanism . 
And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be , again , my bacterial cell -- is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein -- that 's the red box -- it 's an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule , the red triangle . 
And then as the cells grow , they 're all releasing that molecule into the environment , so there 's lots of molecule there . 
And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule . 
These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells . 
When the molecule increases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light . 
Why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous , glow - in - the - dark bacterium that lives in the ocean -- all bacteria have systems like this . 
So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other . 
They make chemical words , they recognize those words , and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison . 
We have a fancy name for this : we call it quorum sensing . 
They vote with these chemical votes , the vote gets counted , and then everybody responds to the vote . 
What 's important for today 's talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions . 
But the one that 's probably the most important to you is virulence . 
It 's not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins -- you 're enormous , that would have no effect on you . You 're huge . 
What they do , we now understand , is they get in you , they wait , they start growing , they count themselves with these little molecules , and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together , they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host . 
Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing . 
That 's how it works . 
We also then went to look at what are these molecules -- these were the red triangles on my slides before . 
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule . 
This is the word that it talks with . 
So then we started to look at other bacteria , and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we 've discovered . 
What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related . 
The left - hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria . 
But the right - hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species . 
What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages . 
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other . 
So these are private , secret conversations . 
These conversations are for intraspecies communication . 
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that 's its language that allows it to count its own siblings . 
Once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors . 
But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria do n't live by themselves , they live in incredible mixtures , with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria . 
And that 's depicted on this slide . This is your skin . 
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin . 
Anywhere on your body , it looks pretty much like this , and what I hope you can see is that there 's all kinds of bacteria there . 
And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria , and it 's about counting your neighbors , it 's not enough to be able to only talk within your species . 
There has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population . 
So we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria , and what we 've found now is that in fact , bacteria are multilingual . 
They all have a species - specific system -- they have a molecule that says " me . " 
But then , running in parallel to that is a second system that we 've discovered , that 's generic . 
So , they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor , and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria . 
It 's used by all different bacteria and it 's the language of interspecies communication . 
What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you . 
They take that information inside , and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who 's in the minority and who 's in the majority of any given population . 
Then again we turn to chemistry , and we figured out what this generic molecule is -- that was the pink ovals on my last slide , this is it . 
It 's a very small , five - carbon molecule . 
What the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule . 
So they 're all using this molecule for interspecies communication . 
This is the bacterial Esperanto . 
Once we got that far , we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language . 
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well . 
I 've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors , they communicate with these molecules . 
Of course , I 've also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing . 
We thought , what if we made these bacteria so they ca n't talk or they ca n't hear ? 
Could n't these be new kinds of antibiotics ? 
Of course , you 've just heard and you already know that we 're running out of antibiotics . 
Bacteria are incredibly multi - drug - resistant right now , and that 's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria . 
They either pop the bacterial membrane , they make the bacterium so it ca n't replicate its DNA . 
We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants . 
And so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases . 
We thought , well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications , just make these bacteria so they ca n't talk , they ca n't count , and they do n't know to launch virulence . 
And so that 's exactly what we 've done , and we 've sort of taken two strategies . 
The first one is we 've targeted the intraspecies communication system . 
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules -- which you saw -- but they 're a little bit different . 
And so they lock into those receptors , and they jam recognition of the real thing . 
By targeting the red system , what we are able to do is to make species - specific , or disease - specific , anti - quorum sensing molecules . 
We 've also done the same thing with the pink system . 
We 've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we 've made antagonists of the interspecies communication system . 
The hope is that these will be used as broad - spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria . 
To finish I 'll just show you the strategy . 
In this one I 'm just using the interspecies molecule , but the logic is exactly the same . 
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal , in this case , a mouse , it does n't initiate virulence right away . 
It gets in , it starts growing , it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules . 
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria that now they 're going to launch their attack , and the animal dies . 
What we 've been able to do is to give these virulent infections , but we give them in conjunction with our anti - quorum sensing molecules -- so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing , but they 're a little bit different which I 've depicted on this slide . 
What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium -- a multi - drug - resistant pathogenic bacterium -- in the same time we give our anti - quorum sensing molecule , in fact , the animal lives . 
We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it 's going to get us around , at least initially , this big problem of resistance . 
What I hope you think , is that bacteria can talk to each other , they use chemicals as their words , they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we 're just now starting to learn about . 
Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular . 
So in the spirit of TED they 're doing things together because it makes a difference . 
What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors , and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals . 
What I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity . 
Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years ; humans , couple hundred thousand . 
We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works . 
We think , by studying bacteria , we 're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body . 
We know that the principles and the rules , if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms , the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well . 
I hope that what you 've learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other . 
By using these two molecules they can say " me " and they can say " you . " 
Again of course that 's what we do , both in a molecular way , and also in an outward way , but I think about the molecular stuff . 
This is exactly what happens in your body . 
It 's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day , and that 's because there 's all of this chemistry going on , these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is , and what their tasks should be . 
Again , we think that bacteria invented that , and you 've just evolved a few more bells and whistles , but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study . 
The final thing is , again just to reiterate that there 's this practical part , and so we 've made these anti - quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics . 
But then , to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth , we 've also made pro - quorum sensing molecules . 
So , we 've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better . 
Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you , keeping you healthy . 
What we 're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you , in the hopes of making you more healthy , making those conversations better , so bacteria can do things that we want them to do better than they would be on their own . 
Finally , I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton , New Jersey . 
Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture . 
I hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works -- I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child . 
Science is done by that demographic . 
All of those people are between 20 and 30 years old , and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country . 
It 's a really lucky demographic to work with . 
I keep getting older and older and they 're always the same age , and it 's just a crazy delightful job . 
I want to thank you for inviting me here . 
It 's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference . 
Thanks .

Michael Sandel : The lost art of democratic debate 
One thing the world needs , one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates . 
We need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument . 
If you think about the arguments we have , most of the time it 's shouting matches on cable television , ideological food fights on the floor of Congress . 
I have a suggestion . 
Look at all the arguments we have these days over health care , over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street , over the gap between rich and poor , over affirmative action and same - sex marriage . 
Lying just beneath the surface of those arguments , with passions raging on all sides , are big questions of moral philosophy , big questions of justice . 
But we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics . 
So what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion . 
First , let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality , give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens , Aristotle 's theory of justice , and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle 's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today . 
So , are you ready for the lecture ? 
According to Aristotle , justice means giving people what they deserve . 
That 's it ; that 's the lecture . 
Now , you may say , well , that 's obvious enough . 
The real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why . 
Take the example of flutes . 
Suppose we 're distributing flutes . 
Who should get the best ones ? 
Let 's see what people -- What would you say ? 
Who should get the best flute ? 
You can just call it out . 
Michael Sandel : At random . You would do it by lottery . 
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them . 
Who else ? 
MS : The best flute players . 
MS : The worst flute players . 
How many say the best flute players ? 
Why ? 
Actually , that was Aristotle 's answer too . 
But here 's a harder question . 
Why do you think , those of you who voted this way , that the best flutes should go to the best flute players ? 
Peter : The greatest benefit to all . 
MS : The greatest benefit to all . 
We 'll hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players . 
That 's Peter ? 
MS : All right . 
Well , it 's a good reason . 
We 'll all be better off if good music is played rather than terrible music . 
But Peter , Aristotle does n't agree with you that that 's the reason . 
That 's all right . 
Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players . 
He said , that 's what flutes are for -- to be played well . 
He says that to reason about just distribution of a thing , we have to reason about , and sometimes argue about , the purpose of the thing , or the social activity -- in this case , musical performance . 
And the point , the essential nature , of musical performance is to produce excellent music . 
It 'll be a happy byproduct that we 'll all benefit . 
But when we think about justice , Aristotle says , what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing . 
One of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy , but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians . 
Now , flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case . 
Let 's take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice . 
It had to do with golf . 
Casey Martin -- a few years ago , Casey Martin -- did any of you hear about him ? 
He was a very good golfer , but he had a disability . 
He had a bad leg , a circulatory problem , that made it very painful for him to walk the course . 
In fact , it carried risk of injury . 
He asked the PGA , the Professional Golfers ' Association , for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments . 
They said , " No . 
Now that would give you an unfair advantage . " 
He sued , and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court , believe it or not , the case over the golf cart , because the law says that the disabled must be accommodated , provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity . 
He says , " I 'm a great golfer . 
I want to compete . 
But I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next . " 
Suppose you were on the Supreme Court . 
Suppose you were deciding the justice of this case . 
How many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart ? 
And how many say , no , he does n't ? 
All right , let 's take a poll , show of hands . 
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin ? 
And how many would not ? How many would say he does n't ? 
All right , we have a good division of opinion here . 
Someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart , what would be your reason ? 
Raise your hand , and we 'll try to get you a microphone . 
What would be your reason ? 
MS : It would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart . 
All right , those of you , I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worry about an unfair advantage . 
What about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart ? 
How would you answer the objection ? 
Yes , all right . 
Audience : The cart 's not part of the game . 
MS : What 's your name ? 
MS : Charlie says -- We 'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply . 
Tell us , Charlie , why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart ? 
Charlie : The cart 's not part of the game . 
MS : But what about walking from hole to hole ? 
Charlie : It does n't matter ; it 's not part of the game . 
MS : Walking the course is not part of the game of golf ? 
Charlie : Not in my book , it is n't . 
MS : All right . Stay there , Charlie . 
Who has an answer for Charlie ? 
All right , who has an answer for Charlie ? 
What would you say ? 
Audience : The endurance element is a very important part of the game , walking all those holes . 
MS : Walking all those holes ? 
That 's part of the game of golf ? 
MS : What 's your name ? 
MS : Warren . 
Charlie , what do you say to Warren ? 
Charley : I 'll stick to my original thesis . 
MS : Warren , are you a golfer ? 
Warren : I am not a golfer . 
Charley : And I am . 
You know , it 's interesting . 
In the case , in the lower court , they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue . 
Is walking the course essential to the game ? 
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer . 
And what do you suppose they all said ? 
Yes . They agreed with Warren . 
They said , yes , walking the course is strenuous physical exercise . 
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf . 
And so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart . 
Now , notice , something interesting -- Well , I should tell you about the Supreme Court first . 
The Supreme Court decided . 
What do you suppose they said ? 
They said yes , that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart . 
Seven to two , they ruled . 
What was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we 've just had is that the discussion about the right , the justice , of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf . 
And the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question . 
And Justice Stevens , writing for the majority , said he had read all about the history of golf , and the essential point of the game is to get very small ball from one place into a hole in as few strokes as possible , and that walking was not essential , but incidental . 
Now , there were two dissenters , one of whom was Justice Scalia . 
He would n't have granted the cart , and he had a very interesting dissent . 
It 's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority 's opinion . 
He said it 's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf . 
Here 's how he put it . 
" To say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object . 
But since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement , that is , what distinguishes games from productive activity , it is quite impossible to say that any of a game 's arbitrary rules is essential . " 
So there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority 's opinion . 
Justice Scalia 's opinion is questionable for two reasons . 
First , no real sports fan would talk that way . 
If we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary , rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring , we would n't care about the outcome of the game . 
It 's also objectionable on a second ground . 
On the face of it , it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart -- an argument about fairness , what 's an unfair advantage . 
But if fairness were the only thing at stake , there would have been an easy and obvious solution . 
What would it be ? 
Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to . 
Then the fairness objection goes away . 
But letting everyone ride in a cart would have been , I suspect , more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA , even than making an exception for Casey Martin . 
Why ? 
Because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf , but , relatedly , the question : What abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents ? 
Let me put the point as delicately as possible : Golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game . 
After all , there 's no running or jumping , and the ball stands still . 
So if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in a golf cart , it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer , the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes . 
That illustrates that with golf , as with flutes , it 's hard to decide the question of what justice requires , without grappling with the question , " What is the essential nature of the activity in question , and what qualities , what excellences connected with that activity , are worthy of honor and recognition ? " 
Let 's take a final example that 's prominent in contemporary political debate : same - sex marriage . 
There are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman , and there are those who favor state recognition of same - sex marriage . 
How many here favor the first policy : the state should recognize traditional marriage only ? 
And how many favor the second , same - sex marriage ? 
Now , put it this way : What ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage ? 
The opponents of same - sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundamentally , is procreation , and that 's what 's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging . 
And the defenders of same - sex marriage say no , procreation is not the only purpose of marriage ; what about a lifelong , mutual , loving commitment ? 
That 's really what marriage is about . 
So with flutes , with golf carts , and even with a fiercely contested question like same - sex marriage , Aristotle has a point . 
Very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition . 
So let 's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , elevate , the terms of political discourse in the United States , and for that matter , around the world . 
There is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics , that 's a recipe for disagreement , and for that matter , a recipe for intolerance and coercion . 
So better to shy away from , to ignore , the moral and the religious convictions that people bring to civic life . 
It seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite , that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life , rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter . 
That , it seems to me , is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . 
Thank you very much . 
Thanks . Thank you . 
Chris . 
Thanks , Chris . 
Chris Anderson : From flutes to golf courses to same - sex marriage -- that was a genius link . 
Now look , you 're a pioneer of open education . 
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big . 
What 's your vision for the next phase of this ? 
MS : Well , I think that it is possible . 
In the classroom , we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions . 
And I think we can do that in public life more generally . 
And so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we 've created of the course -- it 's available now , online , free for everyone anywhere in the world -- and to see whether we can partner with institutions , at universities in China , in India , in Africa , around the world , to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate . 
CA : So you picture , at some point , live , in real time , you could have this kind of conversation , inviting questions , but with people from China and India joining in ? 
MS : Right . We did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach , and we do it in a classroom at Harvard with about 1,000 students . 
Would n't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing , engaging seriously with big moral questions , exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup , students in Beijing and Mumbai and in Cambridge , Massachusetts and create a global classroom . 
That 's what I would love to do . 
CA : So , I would imagine that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor . 
Michael Sandel . Thank you so much . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging.html 
Cambridge researcher Aubrey de Grey argues that aging is merely a disease -- and a curable one at that . Humans age in seven basic ways , he says , all of which can be averted .

Aubrey de Grey says we can avoid aging 
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit , so I 'm going to dive straight in , right at the point where I get this thing to work . 
Here we go . I 'm going to talk about five different things . 
I 'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable . 
I 'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together , and actually talk about this a bit more than we do . 
I 'm going to talk about feasibility as well , of course . 
I 'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging . 
And then I 'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about , you know , how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong , namely , by actually doing something about it . 
I 'm going to do that in two steps . 
The first one I 'm going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which I 'm going to define as 30 years , applied to people who are already in middle - age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging . 
Namely , essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed , to get sick in the first place . 
And of course , the last thing I 'm going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step , that point of maybe 30 years life extension . 
So I 'm going to start with why we should . 
Now , I want to ask a question . 
Hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ? 
That was easy . OK . 
OK . Hands up : anyone in the audience who 's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing . 
That 's very good news , because I thought that was what the answer would be . 
Now the thing is , I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging . 
And here is that characteristic . 
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does . 
Now , I like in an audience , in Britain especially , to talk about the comparison with foxhunting , which is something that was banned after a long struggle , by the government not very many months ago . 
I mean , I know I 'm with a sympathetic audience here , but , as we know , a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic . 
And this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me . 
You know , a lot of people said , " Well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time . 
It 's a traditional part of the way of life , and we should be allowed to carry on doing it . 
It 's ecologically sound ; it stops the population explosion of foxes . " 
But ultimately , the government prevailed in the end , because the majority of the British public , and certainly the majority of members of Parliament , came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society . 
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades . 
What part of this do people not understand ? 
It 's not just about life , of course -- -- it 's about healthy life , you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun , whether or not dying may be fun . 
So really , this is how I would like to describe it . 
It 's a global trance . 
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging . 
And , I mean , OK , I 'm not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless . 
There are some good points to be made here , things that we ought to be thinking about , forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well , so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging . 
But these are completely crazy , when you actually remember your sense of proportion . 
You know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about . 
But the question is , are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite , namely , leaving aging as it is ? 
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ? 
You know , if you have n't got an argument that 's that strong , then just do n't waste my time , is what I say . 
Now , there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong , and here it is . 
People worry about overpopulation ; they say , " Well , if we fix aging , no one 's going to die to speak of , or at least the death toll is going to be much lower , only from crossing St. Giles carelessly . 
And therefore , we 're not going to be able to have many kids , and kids are really important to most people . " 
And that 's true . 
And you know , a lot of people try to fudge this question , and give answers like this . 
I do n't agree with those answers . I think they basically do n't work . 
I think it 's true , that we will face a dilemma in this respect . 
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate , or a high death rate . 
A high death rate will , of course , arise from simply rejecting these therapies , in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids . 
And , I say that that 's fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice . 
What 's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future . 
If we vacillate , hesitate , and do not actually develop these therapies , then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -- who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies , but will not be , because we have n't developed them as quickly as we could -- we 'll be denying those people an indefinite life span , and I consider that that is immoral . 
That 's my answer to the overpopulation question . 
Right . So the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ? 
And the fundamental answer is that the pro - aging trance is not as dumb as it looks . 
It 's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging . 
Aging is ghastly , but it 's inevitable , so , you know , we 've got to find some way to put it out of our minds , and it 's rational to do anything that we might want to do , to do that . 
Like , for example , making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all . 
But of course , that only works when we have both of these components . 
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem . 
This pro - aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things . 
And that 's why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot -- in order to get people 's attention , and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard . 
So that 's all I 'm going to say about that . 
I 'm now going to talk about feasibility . 
And the fundamental reason , I think , why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I 'm giving here . 
A very simple definition . 
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place , which is to say , metabolism . 
This is not a completely tautological statement ; it 's a reasonable statement . 
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars , and it also happens to us , despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self - repair mechanisms , because those self - repair mechanisms are not perfect . 
So basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects . 
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology . 
That 's a fine definition . So we can put it this way : we can say that , you know , we have this chain of events . 
And there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging . 
They 're what I 'm calling here the " gerontology approach " and the " geriatrics approach . " 
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon . 
Of course , it 's a very short - term - ist strategy ; it 's a losing battle , because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on . 
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface , because , you know , prevention is better than cure . 
But unfortunately the thing is that we do n't understand metabolism very well . 
In fact , we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we 're not really too good on yet . 
We 've discovered things like , for example , RNA interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work . 
Basically , gerontology is a fine approach in the end , but it is not an approach whose time has come when we 're talking about intervention . 
So then , what do we do about that ? 
I mean , that 's a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing , pretty ironclad , does n't it ? 
But it is n't . 
Before I tell you why it is n't , I 'm going to go a little bit into what I 'm calling step two . 
Just suppose , as I said , that we do acquire -- let 's say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age , let 's say 55 . 
I 'm going to call that " robust human rejuvenation . " OK . 
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently , of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live ? 
In order to answer that question -- you might think it 's simple , but it 's not simple . 
We ca n't just say , " Well , if they 're young enough to benefit from these therapies , then they 'll live 30 years longer . " 
That 's the wrong answer . 
And the reason it 's the wrong answer is because of progress . 
There are two sorts of technological progress really , for this purpose . 
There are fundamental , major breakthroughs , and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs . 
Now , they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames . 
Fundamental breakthroughs : very hard to predict how long it 's going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough . 
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun , and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it . 
But after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform . 
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight . 
We can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like . 
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore . 
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough . 
And you see it in all sorts of technologies . 
Computers : you can look at a more or less parallel time line , happening of course a bit later . 
You can look at medical care . I mean , hygiene , vaccines , antibiotics -- you know , the same sort of time frame . 
So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , is n't a step at all . 
That in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle - aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp . 
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years . 
In other words , they will be staying ahead of the game . 
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us . 
This is a very important point for me to get across . 
Because , you know , most people , when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that I 'm saying that we 're going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more . 
I 'm not saying that at all . 
I 'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough . 
They 'll never be perfect , but we 'll be able to fix the things that 200-year - olds die of , before we have any 200-year - olds . 
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on . 
I decided to give this a little name , which is " longevity escape velocity . " 
Well , it seems to get the point across . 
So , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive . 
If you 're already 100 , or even if you 're 80 -- and an average 80-year - old , we probably ca n't do a lot for you with these therapies , because you 're too close to death 's door for the really initial , experimental therapies to be good enough for you . 
You wo n't be able to withstand them . 
But if you 're only 50 , then there 's a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and , you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense , in terms of your youthfulness , both physical and mental , and in terms of your risk of death from age - related causes . 
And of course , if you 're a bit younger than that , then you 're never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age - related causes . 
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to , that the first 150-year - old -- we do n't know how old that person is today , because we do n't know how long it 's going to take to get these first - generation therapies . 
But irrespective of that age , I 'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course , to , you know , global catastrophes -- is actually , probably , only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year - old . 
And that 's quite a thought . 
Alright , so finally I 'm going to spend the rest of the talk , my last seven - and - a - half minutes , on step one ; namely , how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity ? 
And in order to do that , I need to talk about mice a little bit . 
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation . 
I 'm calling it " robust mouse rejuvenation , " not very imaginatively . 
And this is what it is . 
I say we 're going to take a long - lived strain of mouse , which basically means mice that live about three years on average . 
We do exactly nothing to them until they 're already two years old . 
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them , and with those therapies , we get them to live , on average , to their fifth birthday . 
So , in other words , we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan , starting from the point that we started the therapies . 
The question then is , what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans ? 
Which we can now , as I 've explained , equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity . 
Secondly , what does it mean for the public 's perception of how long it 's going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ? 
And thirdly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ? 
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question , and it 's extremely hard to answer . 
One has to be very speculative , and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation , that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more . 
I say that 's nonsense . 
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this . 
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame , in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities . 
So , I say that we have a 50/50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone , robust human rejuvenation , within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation . 
15 years from the robust mouse . 
The public 's perception will probably be somewhat better than that . 
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are . 
So they 'll probably think it 's five years away . 
They 'll be wrong , but that actually wo n't matter too much . 
And finally , of course , I think it 's fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier , the coping strategy . 
That will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans , since it 's been postponed so very effectively in mice . 
So we 're likely to end up with a very strong change in people 's attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications . 
So in order to tell you now how we 're going to get these mice , I 'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging . 
I 'm going to use this word " damage " to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology . 
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology , the damage itself is caused ongoing - ly throughout life , starting before we 're born . 
But it is not part of metabolism itself . 
And this turns out to be useful . 
Because we can re - draw our original diagram this way . 
We can say that , fundamentally , the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage . 
And I 'm going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment . 
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology . 
And the reason it 's a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate . 
So there 's a third approach , if we look at it this way . 
We can call it the " engineering approach , " and I claim that the engineering approach is within range . 
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes . 
It does not intervene in this process or this one . 
And that 's good because it means that it 's not a losing battle , and it 's something that we are within range of being able to do , because it does n't involve improving on evolution . 
The engineering approach simply says , " Let 's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely , but repair them quite a lot , so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist , that causes it to be pathogenic . " 
We know that this threshold exists , because we do n't get age - related diseases until we 're in middle age , even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born . 
Why do I say that we 're in range ? Well , this is basically it . 
The point about this slide is actually the bottom . 
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging , we will be here all night , because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another . 
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete . 
The list on the right is also incomplete . 
It 's a list of types of pathology that are age - related , and it 's just an incomplete list . 
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage , side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end , or that might cause pathology . 
And there are only seven of them . 
They 're categories of things , of course , but there 's only seven of them . 
Cell loss , mutations in chromosomes , mutations in the mitochondria and so on . 
First of all , I 'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete . 
Of course one can make a biological argument . 
One can say , " OK , what are we made of ? " 
We 're made of cells and stuff between cells . 
What can damage accumulate in ? 
The answer is : long - lived molecules , because if a short - lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone , too . 
It 's got to be long - lived molecules . 
So , these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news , because it means that , you know , we 've come a long way in biology in these 20 years , so the fact that we have n't extended this list is a pretty good indication that there 's no extension to be done . 
However , it 's better than that ; we actually know how to fix them all , in mice , in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is , we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade . 
Some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top . 
I have n't got time to go through them at all , but my conclusion is that , if we can actually get suitable funding for this , then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years , but we do need to get serious about it . 
We do need to really start trying . 
So of course , there are some biologists in the audience , and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have . 
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff . 
I 've published a great deal on this ; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based , and there 's quite a lot of detail there . 
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I 'm predicting here . 
So if you think that I 'm wrong , you 'd better damn well go and find out why you think I 'm wrong . 
And of course the main thing is that you should n't trust people who call themselves gerontologists because , as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field , you know , you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously . 
So , you know , you 've got to actually do your homework , in order to understand whether this is true . 
And we 'll just end with a few things . 
One thing is , you know , you 'll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time , and everyone said , " Well , it 's obviously impossible . " 
And you know what happened . 
So , you know , this does happen . 
We have various strategies -- there 's the Methuselah Mouse Prize , which is basically an incentive to innovate , and to do what you think is going to work , and you get money for it if you win . 
There 's a proposal to actually put together an institute . 
This is what 's going to take a bit of money . 
But , I mean , look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq ? 
Not very long . OK . 
It 's got to be philanthropic , because profits distract biotech , but it 's basically got a 90 percent chance , I think , of succeeding in this . 
And I think we know how to do it . And I 'll stop there . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : OK . I do n't know if there 's going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance . 
Audience : Since you 've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it , why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man ? 
AG : Because I am an old man . I am actually 158 . 
Audience : Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate . 
However , as far as I know , all the species have evolved to actually die , so when cells divide , the telomerase get shorter , and eventually species die . 
So , why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality , when it is so advantageous , or is evolution just incomplete ? 
AG : Brilliant . Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer . 
I 'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question , which I happen to agree with , which is that , no , aging is not a product of selection , evolution ; [ aging ] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect . 
In other words , we have aging because it 's hard work not to have aging ; you need more genetic pathways , more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly , and that carries on being true the longer you push it out . 
So , to the extent that evolution does n't matter , does n't care whether genes are passed on by individuals , living a long time or by procreation , there 's a certain amount of modulation of that , which is why different species have different lifespans , but that 's why there are no immortal species . 
CA : The genes do n't care but we do ? 
AG : That 's right . 
Audience : Hello . I read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years . 
If I project that , that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I do n't crash on my motorbike . 
That means that I 'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year - old ? 
AG : If you lose a bit of weight . 
Your numbers are a bit out . 
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade . 
So , it 's not quite as good as you might think , you might hope . 
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible . 
Audience : I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo , and that the brain cells last 80 years or so . 
If that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ? 
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years , as opposed to a typical , you know , couple of months ? 
AG : There are technical implications certainly . 
Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate , especially neurons , but we do n't want to replace them any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway , because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function . 
What I said about there being no non - aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification . 
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long - lived cells .

Halla Tomasdottir managed to take her company Audur Capital through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland by applying 5 traditionally " feminine " values to financial services . At TEDWomen , she talks about these values and the importance of balance . 
business , politics , women

Halla Tomasdottir : A feminine response to Iceland 's financial crash 
It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland , because until a couple of years ago , people knew hardly anything about us , and I could basically come out here and say only good things about us . 
But in the last couple of years we 've become infamous for a couple of things . 
First , of course , the economic meltdown . 
It actually got so bad that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay . 
Ninety - nine pence was the starting price and no reserve . 
Then there was the volcano that interrupted the travel plans of almost all of you and many of your friends , including President Obama . 
By the way , the pronunciation is " Eyjafjallajokull . " 
None of your media got it right . 
But I 'm not here to share these stories about these two things exactly . 
I 'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital , which is a financial firm founded by me and Kristin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007 , just over a year before the economic collapse hit . 
Why would two women who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking in the corporate sector leave to found a financial services firm ? 
Well let it suffice to say that we felt a bit overwhelmed with testosterone . 
And I 'm not here to say that men are to blame for the crisis and what happened in my country . 
But I can surely tell you that in my country , much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere , men were at the helm of the game of the financial sector , and that kind of lack of diversity and sameness leads to disastrous problems . 
So we decided , a bit fed - up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this was n't sustainable , to found a financial services firm based on our values , and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance . 
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland . 
We were n't known as the typical " women " women in Iceland up until then . 
So it was almost like coming out of the closet to actually talk about the fact that we were women and that we believed that we had a set of values and a way of doing business that would be more sustainable than what we had experienced until then . 
And we got a great group of people to join us -- principled people with great skills , and investors with a vision and values to match ours . 
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland without taking any direct losses to our equity or to the funds of our clients . 
And although I want to thank the talented people of our company foremost for that -- and also there 's a factor of luck and timing -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values . 
So let me share with you our values . 
We believe in risk awareness . 
What does that mean ? 
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you 're taking , and we will not invest in things we do n't understand . 
Not a complicated thing . 
But in 2007 , at the height of the sub - prime and all the complicated financial structures , it was quite opposite to the reckless risk - taking behaviors that we saw on the market . 
We also believe in straight - talking , telling it as it is , using simple language that people understand , telling people about the downsides as well as the potential upsides , and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter , like our lack of belief in the sustainability of the Icelandic financial sector that already we had months before the collapse hit us . 
And , although we do work in the financial sector , where Excel is king , we believe in emotional capital . 
And we believe that doing emotional due diligence is just as important as doing financial due diligence . 
It is actually people that make money and lose money , not Excel spreadsheets . 
Last , but not least , we believe in profit with principles . 
We care how we make our profit . 
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers , we are willing to do it with a long - term view , and we like to have a wider definition of profits than just the economic profit in the next quarter . 
So we like to see profits , plus positive social and environmental benefits , when we invest . 
But it was n't just about the values , although we are convinced that they matter . 
It was also about a business opportunity . 
It 's the female trend , and it 's the sustainability trend , that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come . 
The whole thing about the female trend is not about women being better than men ; it is actually about women being different from men , bringing different values and different ways to the table . 
So what do you get ? You get better decision - making , and you get less herd behavior , and both of those things hit your bottom line with very positive results . 
But one has to wonder , now that we 've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland -- and by the way , Europe looks pretty bad right now , and many would say that you in America are heading for some more trouble as well . 
Now that we 've had all that happen , and we have all this data out there telling us that it 's much better to have diversity around the decision - making tables , will we see business and finance change ? 
Will government change ? 
Well I 'll give you my straight talk about this . 
I have days that I believe , but I have days that I 'm full of doubt . 
Have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us ? 
Einstein said that this was the definition of insanity -- to do the same things over and over again , hoping for a different outcome . 
So I guess the world is insane , because I see entirely too much of doing the same things over and over again , hoping that this time it 's not going to collapse upon us . 
I want to see more revolutionary thinking , and I remain hopeful . 
Like TED , I believe in people . 
And I know that consumers are becoming more conscious , and they are going to start voting with their wallets , and they are going to change the face of business and finance from the outside , if they do n't do it from the inside . 
But I 'm more of the revolutionary , and I should be ; I 'm from Iceland . 
We have a long history of strong , courageous , independent women , ever since the Viking age . 
And I want to tell you when I first realized that women matter to the economy and to the society , I was seven -- it happened to be my mother 's birthday -- October 24 , 1975 . 
Women in Iceland took the day off . 
From work or from home , they took the day off , and nothing worked in Iceland . 
They marched into the center of Reykjavik , and they put women 's issues onto the agenda . 
And some say this was the start of a global movement . 
For me it was the start of a long journey , but I decided that day to matter . 
Five years later , Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president -- first female to become head of state , single mom , a breast cancer survivor who had had one of her breasts removed . 
And at one of the campaign sessions , she had one of her male contenders allude to the fact that she could n't become president -- she was a woman , and even half a woman . 
That night she won the election , because she came back -- not just because of his crappy behavior -- but she came back and said , " Well , I 'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation ; I 'm going to lead it . " 
So I 've had incredibly many women role models that have influenced who I am and where I am today . 
But in spite of that , I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career mostly in denial of being a woman . 
Started in corporate America , and I was absolutely convinced that it was just about the individual , that women and men would have just the same opportunities . 
But I 've come to conclude lately that it is n't like that . 
We are not the same , and it 's great . Because of our differences , we create and sustain life . 
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge . 
The final thought I want to leave with you is that I 'm fed up with this tyranny of either / or choices in life -- either it 's men or it 's women . 
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance . 
So let 's move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there , and let 's start thinking about doing good business . 
That 's how we change the world . That 's the only sustainable future . 
Thank you .

Ngozi Okonjo - Iweala on aid versus trade 
It 's very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spoken . Everything has been said . 
So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here , and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away , and take forward and work on . 
That 's what I 'd like to try and do . 
We came here saying we want to talk about " Africa : the Next Chapter . " 
But we are talking about " Africa : the Next Chapter " because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we 're looking at , and saying it 's not such a good thing . 
The picture I showed you before , and this picture , of drought , death and disease is what we usually see . 
What we want to look at is " Africa : the Next Chapter , " and that 's this : a healthy , smiling , beautiful African . 
And I think it 's worth remembering what we 've heard through the conference right from the first day , where I heard that all the important statistics have been given -- about where we are now , about how the continent is doing much better . 
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on . 
So I 'm not going to spend too much time -- just to show you , refresh your memories that we are here for " Africa : the Next Chapter " because for the first time there really is a platform to build on . 
We really do have it going right that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen . 
After decades of 2 percent , we are now at 5 percent , and it 's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even . 
And inflation has come down . 
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically . 
You know , as you can see , from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion . 
Now this is a huge achievement . 
You know , we 've built up reserves . Why is that important ? 
It 's because it shows off our economies , shows off our currencies and gives a platform on which people can plan and build , including businesses . 
We 've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference because private investment flows have increased . 
I want to remind you again -- I know you saw these statistics before -- from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion . 
In 2005 , remittances -- I just took one country , Nigeria skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic , but increasing dramatically . 
And in many other countries this is happening . 
Why is this important ? Because it shows confidence . 
People are now confident to bring -- if your people in the diaspora bring their money back , it shows other people that , look , there is emerging confidence in your country . 
And instead of an outflow , you are now getting a net inflow . 
Now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ? 
It 's important that we build this platform , that we have the president , Kikwete , and others of our leaders who are saying , " Look , we must do something different . " 
Because we are confronted with a challenge . 
62 percent of our population is below the age of 24 . 
What does this mean ? 
This means that we have to focus on how our youth are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives . 
You have to focus on how to create jobs , make sure they do n't fall into disease , and that they get an education . 
But most of all that they are productively engaged in life , and that they are creating the kind of productive environment in our countries that will make things happen . 
And to support this , I just recently -- one of the things I 've done since leaving government is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria . 
Most of our countries do n't even have any opinion research . 
People do n't have voice . 
There is no way you can know what people want . 
One of the things we asked them recently was what 's their top issue . 
Like in every other country where this has been done , jobs is the top issue . 
I want to leave this up here and come back to it . 
But before I get to this slide , I just wanted to run you through this . 
And to say that for me , the next stage of building this platform that now enables us to move forward -- and we must n't make light of it . 
It was only 5 , 6 , 7 years ago we could n't even talk about the next chapter , because we were in the old chapter . 
We were going nowhere . 
The economies were not growing . 
We were having negative per capita growth . 
The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward was not even there . 
So let 's not forget that it 's taken a lot to build this , including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to . 
Creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabilizing the micro economy . 
So now we have this platform we can build on . 
And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here : aid versus private sector , aid versus trade , etc . 
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things is that it 's been a simplistic debate . 
And that 's not what the debate should be about . 
That 's engaging in the wrong debate . 
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors , the private sector and ordinary African people taking charge of their own lives ? 
How do we combine all this ? 
To move our continent forward , to do the things that need doing that I talked about -- getting young people employed . 
Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent , much of what you have seen here . 
So I 'm afraid we 've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate . 
We need to bring it back to say , what is the combination of all these factors that is going to yield what we want ? 
And I want to tell you something . 
For me , the issue about aid -- I do n't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid . 
Africa has been giving the other countries aid . 
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid . 
And I said , " Mo , you 're right . We have -- no , but we 've already been doing it ! 
The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa 's aid . " 
It is all the resources that were taken from Africa , including human , that built these countries today ! 
So when they try to give back , we should n't be on the defensive . 
The issue is not that . 
The issue is how are we using what has been given back . 
How are we using it ? 
Is it being directed effectively ? 
I want to tell you a little story . 
Why I do n't mind if we get aid , but we use it well . 
From 1967 to ' 70 , Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria - Biafra war . 
And in the middle of that war , I was 14 years old . 
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking . 
For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army . 
We were on the Biafran side . 
And we were down to eating one meal a day , running from place to place , but wherever we could help we did . 
At a certain point in time , in 1969 , things were really bad . 
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day . 
People , children were dying of kwashiorkor . 
I 'm sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures . 
Well , I was in the middle of it . 
In the midst of all this , my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days . 
We thought she was going to die . 
My father was not there . 
He was in the army . 
So I was the oldest person in the house . 
My sister fell very ill with malaria . 
She was three years old and I was 15 . 
And she had such a high fever . We tried everything . 
It did n't look like it was going to work . 
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor , who was looking at people and giving them meds . 
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning -- and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back . 
It was really hot . I was very hungry . 
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman . 
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people . 
I walked 10 kilometers , putting one foot in front of the other . 
I got there and I saw huge crowds . 
Almost a thousand people were there , trying to break down the door . 
She was doing this in a church . How was I going to get in ? 
I had to crawl in between the legs of these people with my sister strapped on my back , find a way to a window . 
And while they were trying to break down the door , I climbed in through the window , and jumped in . 
This woman told me it was in the nick of time . 
By the time we jumped into that hall , she was barely moving . 
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then -- gave her some -- it must have been a re - hydration -- and some other therapies , and put us in a corner . 
In about two to three hours , she started to move . 
And then they toweled her down because she started sweating , which was a good sign . 
And then my sister woke up . 
And about five or six hours later , she said we could go home . 
I strapped her on my back . 
I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had . 
I was so happy -- -- that my sister was alive ! 
Today she 's 41 years old , a mother of three , and she 's a physician saving other lives . 
Why am I telling that ? I 'm telling you that because -- when it is you or your person involved -- you do n't care where -- whether it 's aid . 
You do n't care what it is ! 
You just want the person to be alive ! 
And now let me become less sentimental , and say that saving lives -- which some of the aid we get does on this continent -- when you save the life of anyone , a farmer , a teacher , a mother , they are contributing productively into the economy . 
And as an economist , we can also look at that side of the story . 
These are people who are productive agents in the economy . 
So if we save people from HIV / AIDS , if we save them from malaria , it means they can form the base of production for our economy . 
And by the same token -- as someone said yesterday -- if we do n't and they die , their children will become a burden on the economy . 
So even from an economic standpoint , if we leave the social and the humanitarian , we need to save lives now . 
So that 's one of the reasons , from a personal experience , that I say let 's channel these resources we get into something productive . 
However , I will also tell you that I 'm one of those who does n't believe that this is the sole answer . 
That 's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated . 
You know , we have to use it well . 
What has happened in Europe ? 
Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU -- got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU ? 
Resources that were transferred to them -- and were the Spanish ashamed of this ? No ! 
The EU transferred 10 billion . Where did they use it ? 
Have you been to southern Spain lately ? There are roads everywhere . 
Infrastructure everywhere . 
It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain has developed into a services economy . 
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid ? 
Ireland is one of the fastest - growing economies in the European Union today . 
For which many people , even from other parts of the world , are going there to find jobs . 
What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid ? 
They used it to build an information superhighway , gain infrastructure that enables them to participate in the information technology revolution , and to create jobs in their economy . 
They did n't say , " No , you know , we 're not going to take this . " 
Today , the European Union is busy transferring aid . 
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain -- which is roads , highways , other things that they can build -- I say then , why do they refuse to use the same aid to build the same infrastructure in our countries ? 
When we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now . 
Now we talk about the World Bank , IMF , and accountability , all that and the EU . 
We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money -- some of them in this audience , with private foundations . 
And one day , these foundations have so much money , they will overtake the official aid that is being given . 
But I fear -- and I 'm very grateful to all of them for what they are trying to do on the continent -- but I 'm also worried . I wake up with a gnawing in my belly because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent . 
And they 're also going from country to country , and many times trying to find what to do . 
But I 'm not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way . 
And many of them are not really familiar with the continent . 
They are just discovering . 
And many times I do n't see Africans working with them . 
They are just going alone ! 
And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested in hearing from Africans who might know . 
They want to visit us , see what 's happening on the ground and make a decision . 
And now I 'm maybe being harsh . 
But I worry because this money is so important . 
Now , who are they accountable to ? 
Are we on their boards when they make decisions about where to channel money ? Are we there ? 
Will we make the same mistake that we made before ? 
Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about -- have they ever called these people together and said , " Look , your foundation and your foundation -- you have so much money , we are grateful . 
Let 's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled and where this aid should go . " 
Have we done that ? The answer is no . 
And each one is making their own individual effort . 
And then 10 years from now , billions will again have gone into Africa , and we would still have the same problems . 
This is what gives us the hopeless image . 
Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , " Sit down . " 
And we do n't do it because there are so many of us . We do n't coordinate . 
We 've not called the Bill Gates , and the Soros , and everybody else who is helping and say , " Sit down . Let 's have a conference with you . 
As a continent , here are our priorities . 
Here is where we want you to channel this money . " 
Each one should not be an entrepreneur going out and finding what is best . 
We 're not trying to stop them at all ! But to help them help us better . 
And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this . 
Ten years from now we will have the same story , and we will be repeating the same things . 
So our problem right now is , how can we leverage all this good will that is coming towards our way ? 
How can we get government to combine properly with these private foundations , with the international organizations , and with our private sector . 
I firmly believe in that private sector thing too . 
But it can not do it alone . 
So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work . 
They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas . 
So why do n't we think of using some of this aid ? 
Well , why do n't we first say to those helping us out , " Do n't be shy about infrastructure . 
That health that you 're working on can not be sustainable without infrastructure . 
That education will work better if we 've got electricity and railroads , and so on . 
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market . 
Do n't be shy of it . 
Invest some of your resources in that , too . " 
And then we can see that this is one combination of private , international , multilateral money , private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership , so that aid can be a facilitator . 
That is all aid can be . 
Aid can not solve our problems , I 'm firmly convinced about that . 
But it can be catalytic . And if we fail to use it as catalytic , we would have failed . 
One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now -- one of the reasons is not only just that , you know , these people are stupid and China is coming to take resources . 
It 's because there 's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese . 
If you tell them , " We need a road here , " they will help you build it . 
They do n't shy away from infrastructure . 
In fact , the Chinese minister of finance said to me , when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria . 
He said , " There are two things you need only . 
Infrastructure , infrastructure , infrastructure and discipline . 
You are undisciplined . " 
And I repeat it for the continent . 
It 's the same . We need infrastructure , infrastructure and discipline . 
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that . 
Now I realize -- I 'm not saying -- health and education -- no , you can also provide that as well . 
But I 'm saying it 's not either or . 
Let 's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership . 
One idea . 
Second thing , for the private sector , people are afraid to take risks on the continent . 
Why ca n't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms , to enable people to take risk ? 
And finally , because they are both standing at my -- I 'm out of time . 
Am I out of time ? 
OK , so let me not forget my punchline . 
One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is to support women , to create jobs . 
A lot has been said here about women , I do n't need to repeat it . 
But there are people -- women -- creating jobs . 
And we know , studies have shown that when you put resources in the hand of the woman -- in fact , there 's an econometric study , the World Bank Review , done in 2000 , showing that transfers into the hands of women result in healthier children , more for the household , more for the economy and all that . 
So I 'm saying that one of the takeaways from here -- I 'm not saying the men are not important -- obviously , if you leave the husbands out , what will they do ? 
They 'll come back home and get disgruntled , and it will result in difficulties we do n't want . 
We do n't want men beating their wives because they do n't have a job , and so on . 
But at the margin , we also -- I want to push this , because the reason is the men automatically -- they get -- not automatically , but they tend to get more support . 
But I want you to realize that resources in the hands of African women is a powerful tool . 
There are people creating jobs . 
Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda . 
We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria , with the chair company . 
She wants to expand . 
She needs another 20 million . 
She will create another 100 , 200 more jobs . 
So take away from here is how are you going to put together the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle who are ready -- business people who want to expand and create more jobs . 
And lastly , what are you going to do to be part of this partnership of aid , government , private sector and the African as an individual ? 
Thank you .

Musician and researcher Charles Limb wondered how the brain works during musical improvisation -- so he put jazz musicians and rappers in an fMRI to find out . What he and his team found has deep implications for our understanding of creativity of all kinds .

Charles Limb : Your brain on improv 
So I am a surgeon who studies creativity , and I have never had a patient tell me that " I really want you to be creative during surgery , " and so I guess there 's a little bit of irony to it . 
I will say though that , after having done surgery a lot , it 's somewhat similar to playing a musical instrument . 
And for me , this sort of deep and enduring fascination with sound is what led me to both be a surgeon and also to study the science of sound , particularly music . 
And so I 'm going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I 'm able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative . 
I 've done most of this work at Johns Hopkins University , but also at the National Institute of Health where I was previously . 
I 'm going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments . 
I 'm going to start off by playing a video for you . 
And this video is a video of Keith Jarrett , who 's a well - known jazz improviser and probably the most well - known , iconic example of someone who takes improvisation to a really higher level . 
And he 'll improvise entire concerts off the top of his head , and he 'll never play it exactly the same way again , and so , as a form of intense creativity , I think this is a great example . 
And so why do n't we go and click the video . 
It 's really a remarkable , awesome thing that happens there . 
I 've always -- just as a listener , as just a fan -- I listen to that , and I 'm just astounded . 
I think -- how can this possibly be ? 
How can the brain generate that much information , that much music , spontaneously ? 
And so I set out with this concept , scientifically , that artistic creativity , it 's magical , but it 's not magic , meaning that it 's a product of the brain . 
There 's not too many brain - dead people creating art . 
And so with this notion that artistic creativity is in fact a neurologic product , I took this thesis that we could study it just like we study any other complex neurologic process . 
And I think there 's some sub - questions there that I put there . 
Is it truly possible to study creativity scientifically ? 
And I think that 's a good question . 
And I 'll tell you that most scientific studies of music , they 're very dense , and when you actually go through them , it 's very hard to recognize the music in it . 
In fact , they seem to be very unmusical entirely and to miss the whole point of the music . 
And so it brings the second question : Why should scientists study creativity ? 
Maybe we 're not the right people to do it . 
Well it may be , but I will say that , from a scientific perspective -- we talked a lot about innovation today -- the science of innovation , how much we understand about how the brain is able to innovate is in its infancy , and truly , we know very little about how we are able to be creative . 
And so I think that we 're going to see over the next 10 , 20 , 30 years a real science of creativity that 's burgeoning and is going to flourish . 
Because we now have new methods that can enable us to take this process of something like this , complex jazz improvisation , and study it rigorously . 
And so it gets down to the brain . 
And so all of us have this remarkable brain , which is poorly understood to say the least . 
I think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers , and I myself , I 'm not going to give you many answers today , just ask a lot of questions . 
And fundamentally that 's what I do in my lab . 
I ask questions about what is this brain doing to enable us to do this . 
This is the main method that I use . This is called functional MRI . 
If you 've been in an MRI scanner , it 's very much the same , but this one is outfitted in a special way to not just take pictures of your brain , but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain . 
Now the way that 's done is by the following . 
There 's something called BOLD imaging , which is Blood Oxygen Level Dependent imaging . 
Now when you 're in an fMRI scanner , you 're in a big magnet that 's aligning your molecules in certain areas . 
When an area of the brain is active , meaning a neural area is active , it gets blood flow shunted to that area . 
That blood flow causes an increase in local blood to that area with a deoxyhemoglobin change in concentration . 
Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI , whereas oxyhemoglobin ca n't . 
So through this method of inference -- and we 're measuring blood flow , not neural activity -- we say that an area of the brain that 's getting more blood was active during a particular task , and that 's the crux of how fMRI works . 
And it 's been used since the ' 90s to study really complex processes . 
Now I 'm going to review a study that I did , which was jazz in an fMRI scanner . 
And this was done with a colleague of mine , Alan Braun , at the NIH . 
This is a short video of how we did this project . 
Charles Limb : This is a plastic MIDI piano keyboard that we use for the jazz experiments . 
And it 's a 35-key keyboard that is designed to fit both inside the scanner , be magnetically safe , have minimal interference that would contribute to any artifact and have this cushion so that it can rest on the players ' legs while they 're lying down in the scanner , playing on their back . 
And it works like this -- this does n't actually produce any sound . 
It sends out what 's called a MIDI signal -- or a Musical Instrument Digital Interface -- through these wires into the box and then the computer , which then trigger high - quality piano samples like this . 
CL : Okay , so it works . 
And so through this piano keyboard , we now have the means to take a musical process and study it . 
So what do you do now that you have this cool piano keyboard ? 
You ca n't just sort of -- " It 's great we 've got this keyboard . " 
We actually have to come up with a scientific experiment . 
And so the experiment really rests on the following : What happens in the brain during something that 's memorized and over - learned , and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated , or improvised , in a way that 's matched motorically and in terms of lower - level sensory motor features ? 
And so , I have here what we call the " paradigms . " 
There 's a scale paradigm , which is just playing a scale up and down , memorized . 
And then there 's improvising on a scale -- quarter notes , metronome , right hand -- scientifically very safe , but musically really boring . 
And then there 's the bottom one , which is called the jazz paradigm . 
And so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the NIH , and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left , the lower - left -- which is what you heard me playing -- and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes . 
And if you can hit that lower - right sound icon , that 's an example of what was recorded in the scanner . 
So in the end , it 's not the most natural environment , but they 're able to play real music . 
And I 've listened to that solo 200 times , and I still like it . 
And the musicians , they were comfortable in the end . 
And so we first measured the number of notes . 
Were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were improvising ? 
That was not what was going on . 
And then we looked at the brain activity . 
I 'm going to try to condense this for you . 
These are contrast maps that are showing subtractions between what changes when you 're improvising versus when you 're doing something memorized . 
In red is an area that active in the prefrontal cortex , the frontal lobe of the brain , and in blue is this area that was deactivated . 
And so we had this focal area called the medial prefrontal cortex that went way up in activity . 
We had this broad patch of area called the lateral prefrontal cortex that went way down in activity , and I 'll summarize that for you here . 
Now these are multifunctional areas of the brain . 
As I like to say , these are not the " jazz areas " of the brain . 
They do a whole host of things that have to do with self - reflection , introspection , working memory and so forth . 
Really , consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe . 
But we have this combination of an area that 's thought to be involved in self - monitoring , turning off , and this area that 's thought to be autobiographical , or self - expressive , turning on . 
And we think , at least in this preliminary -- it 's one study ; it 's probably wrong , but it 's one study -- we think that at least a reasonable hypothesis is that , to be creative , you have to have this weird dissociation in your frontal lobe . 
One area turns on , and a big area shuts off , so that you 're not inhibited , so that you 're willing to make mistakes , so that you 're not constantly shutting down all of these new generative impulses . 
Now a lot of people know that music is not always a solo activity -- sometimes it 's done communicatively . 
And so the next question was : What happens when musicians are trading back and forth , something called " trading fours , " which is something they do normally in a jazz experiment ? 
So this is a twelve - bar blues . 
And I 've broken it down into four - bar groups here , so you would know how you would trade . 
Now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner -- same way -- had them memorize this melody and then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively . 
So this is a musician , Mike Pope , one of the world 's best bassists and a fantastic piano player . 
So he 's now playing the piece that we just saw just a little better than I wrote it . 
CL : Mike , come on in . Mike Pope : May the force be with you . 
Nurse : Nothing 's in your pockets , right Mike ? 
MP : Nope . Nothing 's in my pockets . Nurse : Okay . 
CL : You have to have the right attitude to agree to it . 
It 's kind of fun actually . 
And so now we 're playing back and forth . 
He 's in there . You can see his legs up there . 
And then I 'm in the control room here , playing back and forth . 
Mike Pope : This is a pretty good representation of what it 's like . 
And it 's good that it 's not too quick . 
The fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings . 
So the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing , of looking at my hands through two mirrors , laying on my back and not able to move at all except for my hand . 
That was challenging . 
But again , there were moments , for sure , there were moments of real , honest - to - God musical interplay , for sure . 
CL : At this point , I 'll take a few moments . 
And so what you 're seeing here -- and I 'm doing a cardinal sin in science , which is to show you preliminary data . 
This is one subject 's data . 
This is , in fact , Mike Pope 's data . 
So what am I showing you here ? 
When he was trading fours with me , improvising versus memorized , his language areas lit up , his Broca 's area , which is inferior frontal gyrus on the left . 
He actually had it also homologous on the right . 
This is an area thought to be involved in expressive communication . 
This whole notion that music is a language -- well maybe there 's a neurologic basis to it in fact after all , and we can see it when two musicians are having a musical conversation . 
And so we 've done this actually on eight subjects now , and we 're just getting all the data together , so hopefully we 'll have something to say about it meaningfully . 
Now when I think about improvisation and the language , well what 's next ? 
Rap , of course , rap -- free - style . 
And so I 've always been fascinated by free - style . 
And let 's go ahead and play this video here . 
Mos Def : ♫ ... brown skin I be , standing five - ten I be ♫ ♫ Rockin ' it when I be , in your vicinity ♫ ♫ Whole - style synergy , recognize symmetry ♫ ♫ Go and try to injure me , broke 'em down chemically ♫ ♫ Styled it like Kennedy , late like a 10 to three ♫ ♫ When I say when I be , girls say bend that key cut ♫ CL : And so there 's a lot of analogy between what takes place in free - style rap and jazz . 
There are , in fact , a lot of correlations between the two forms of music I think in different time periods . 
In a lot a ways , rap serves the same social function that jazz used to serve . 
So how do you study rap scientifically ? 
And my colleagues kind of think I 'm crazy , but I think it 's very viable . 
And so this is what you do : you have a free - style artist come in and memorize a rap that you write for them , that they 've never heard before , and then you have them free - style . 
So I told my lab members that I would rap for TED , and they said , " No , you wo n't . " 
And then I thought -- But here 's the thing . 
With this big screen , you can all rap with me . Okay ? 
So what we had them do was memorize this lower - left sound icon , please . 
This is the control condition . This is what they memorized . 
Computer : ♫ Memory , thump . ♫ CL : ♫ Thump of the beat in a known repeat ♫ ♫ Rhythm and rhyme , they make me complete ♫ ♫ The climb is sublime when I 'm on the mic ♫ ♫ Spittin ' rhymes that hit you like a lightning strike ♫ ♫ I search for the truth in this eternal quest ♫ ♫ My passion 's not fashion , you can see how I 'm dressed ♫ ♫ Psychopathic words in my head appear ♫ ♫ Whisper these lyrics only I can hear ♫ ♫ The art of discovering and that which is hovering ♫ ♫ Inside the mind of those unconfined ♫ ♫ All of these words keep pouring out like rain ♫ ♫ I need a mad scientist to check my brain ♫ I guarantee you that will never happen again . 
So now , what 's great about these free - stylers , they will get cued different words . 
They do n't know what 's coming , but they 'll hear something off the cuff . 
Go ahead and hit that right sound icon . 
They are going to be cued these three square words : " like , " " not " and " head . " 
He does n't know what 's coming . 
Free - styler : ♫ I 'm like some kind of [ unclear ] ♫ ♫ [ unclear ] extraterrestrial , celestial scene ♫ ♫ Back in the days , I used to sit in pyramids and meditate ♫ ♫ With two microphones hovering over my head ♫ ♫ See if I could still listen , spittin ' off the sound ♫ ♫ See what you grinning ♫ ♫ I teach the children in the back of the classroom ♫ ♫ About the message of apocalyptical ♫ ♫ Not really though , 'cause I 've got to keep it simple ♫ ♫ [ unclear ] instrumental ♫ ♫ Detrimental playing Super Mario ♫ ♫ [ unclear ] boxes [ unclear ] hip hop ♫ CL : So again , it 's an incredible thing that 's taking place . 
It 's doing something that , neurologically , is remarkable . 
Whether or not you like the music is irrelevant . 
Creatively speaking , it 's just a phenomenal thing . 
This is a short video of how we actually do this in a scanner . 
CL : We 're here with Emmanuel . 
CL : That was recorded in the scanner , by the way . 
CL : That 's Emmanuel in the scanner . 
He 's just memorized a rhyme for us . 
Emmanuel : ♫ Top of the beat with no repeat ♫ ♫ Rhythm and rhyme make me complete ♫ ♫ Climb is sublime when I 'm on the mic ♫ ♫ Spittin ' rhymes that 'll hit you like a lightning strike ♫ ♫ I search for the truth in this eternal quest ♫ ♫ I 'm passing on fashion ; you can see how I 'm dressed ♫ CL : Okay . So I 'm going to stop that there . So what do we see in his brain ? 
Well , this is actually four rappers ' brains . 
And what we see , we do see language areas lighting up , but then -- eyes closed -- when you are free - styling versus memorizing , you 've got major visual areas lighting up . 
You 've got major cerebellar activity , which is involved in motor coordination . 
You have heightened brain activity when you 're doing a comparable task , when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized . 
It 's very preliminary , but I think it 's kind of cool . 
So just to conclude , we 've got a lot of questions to ask , and like I said , we 'll ask questions here , not answer them . 
But we want to get at the root of what is creative genius , neurologically , and I think , with these methods , we 're getting close to being there . 
And I think hopefully in the next 10 , 20 years you 'll actually see real , meaningful studies that say science has to catch up to art , and maybe we 're starting now to get there . 
And so I want to thank you for your time . I appreciate it . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_benjamin_s_formula_for_changing_math_education.html 
Someone always asks the math teacher , " Am I going to use calculus in real life ? " And for most of us , says Arthur Benjamin , the answer is no . He offers a bold proposal on how to make math education relevant in the digital age . 
economics , education , math , statistics

Arthur Benjamin 's formula for changing math education 
Now , if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics , then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country . 
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive . 
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra . 
And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject . 
And at top of that pyramid , it 's calculus . 
And I 'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... 
that the correct summit -- that all of our students , every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics : probability and statistics . 
I mean , do n't get me wrong . Calculus is an important subject . 
It 's one of the great products of the human mind . 
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus . 
And every student who studies math , science , engineering , economics , they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college . 
But I 'm here to say , as a professor of mathematics , that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious , meaningful way , in their day - to - day lives . 
On the other hand , statistics -- that 's a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . Right ? 
It 's risk . It 's reward . It 's randomness . 
It 's understanding data . 
I think if our students , if our high school students -- if all of the American citizens -- knew about probability and statistics , we would n't be in the economic mess that we 're in today . 
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ... 
but if it 's taught properly , it can be a lot of fun . 
I mean , probability and statistics , it 's the mathematics of games and gambling . 
It 's analyzing trends . It 's predicting the future . 
Look , the world has changed from analog to digital . 
And it 's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital , from the more classical , continuous mathematics , to the more modern , discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty , of randomness , of data -- that being probability and statistics . 
In summary , instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus , I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means . And I mean it . 
Thank you very much . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/tan_le_a_headset_that_reads_your_brainwaves.html 
Tan Le 's astonishing new computer interface reads its user 's brainwaves , making it possible to control virtual objects , and even physical electronics , with mere thoughts . She demos the headset , and talks about its far - reaching applications .

Tan Le : A headset that reads your brainwaves 
Up until now , our communication with machines has always been limited to conscious and direct forms . 
Whether it 's something simple like turning on the lights with a switch , or even as complex as programming robotics , we have always had to give a command to a machine , or even a series of commands , in order for it to do something for us . 
Communication between people , on the other hand , is far more complex and a lot more interesting because we take into account so much more than what is explicitly expressed . 
We observe facial expressions , body language , and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another . 
This actually forms a large part of our decision - making process . 
Our vision is to introduce this whole new realm of human interaction into human - computer interaction so that computers can understand not only what you direct it to do , but it can also respond to your facial expressions and emotional experiences . 
And what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain , our center for control and experience . 
Well , it sounds like a pretty good idea , but this task , as Bruno mentioned , is n't an easy one for two main reasons : First , the detection algorithms . 
Our brain is made up of billions of active neurons , around 170,000 km of combined axon length . 
When these neurons interact , the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse , which can be measured . 
The majority of our functional brain is distributed over the outer surface layer of the brain , and to increase the area that 's available for mental capacity , the brain surface is highly folded . 
Now this cortical folding presents a significant challenge for interpreting surface electrical impulses . 
Each individual 's cortex is folded differently , very much like a fingerprint . 
So even though a signal may come from the same functional part of the brain , by the time the structure has been folded , its physical location is very different between individuals , even identical twins . 
There is no longer any consistency in the surface signals . 
Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex , so that we can map the signals closer to its source , and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population . 
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves . 
EEG measurements typically involve a hairnet with an array of sensors , like the one that you can see here in the photo . 
A technician will put the electrodes onto the scalp using a conductive gel or paste and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp by light abrasion . 
Now this is quite time consuming and is n't the most comfortable process . 
And on top of that , these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars . 
So with that , I 'd like to invite onstage Evan Grant , who is one of last year 's speakers , who 's kindly agreed to help me to demonstrate what we 've been able to develop . 
So the device that you see is a 14-channel , high - fidelity EEG acquisition system . 
It does n't require any scalp preparation , no conductive gel or paste . 
It only takes a few minutes to put on and for the signals to settle . 
It 's also wireless , so it gives you the freedom to move around . 
And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars for a traditional EEG system , this headset only costs a few hundred dollars . 
Now on to the detection algorithms . 
So facial expressions -- as I mentioned before in emotional experiences -- are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization . 
But with the limited time we have available , I 'd like to show you the cognitive suite , which is the ability for you to basically move virtual objects with your mind . 
Now , Evan is new to this system , so what we have to do first is create a new profile for him . 
He 's obviously not Joanne -- so we 'll " add user . " 
Evan . Okay . 
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite is to start with training a neutral signal . 
With neutral , there 's nothing in particular that Evan needs to do . 
He just hangs out . He 's relaxed . 
And the idea is to establish a baseline or normal state for his brain , because every brain is different . 
It takes eight seconds to do this , and now that that 's done , we can choose a movement - based action . 
So Evan , choose something that you can visualize clearly in your mind . 
Evan Grant : Let 's do " pull . " 
Tan Le : Okay , so let 's choose " pull . " 
So the idea here now is that Evan needs to imagine the object coming forward into the screen , and there 's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen while he 's doing that . 
The first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he thinks about " pull . " 
But maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds . 
So : one , two , three , go . 
Okay . 
So once we accept this , the cube is live . 
So let 's see if Evan can actually try and imagine pulling . 
Ah , good job ! 
That 's really amazing . 
So we have a little bit of time available , so I 'm going to ask Evan to do a really difficult task . 
And this one is difficult because it 's all about being able to visualize something that does n't exist in our physical world . 
This is " disappear . " 
So what you want to do -- at least with movement - based actions , we do that all the time , so you can visualize it . 
But with " disappear , " there 's really no analogies -- so Evan , what you want to do here is to imagine the cube slowly fading out , okay . 
Same sort of drill . So : one , two , three , go . 
Okay . Let 's try that . 
Oh , my goodness . He 's just too good . 
Let 's try that again . 
EG : Losing concentration . 
TL : But we can see that it actually works , even though you can only hold it for a little bit of time . 
As I said , it 's a very difficult process to imagine this . 
And the great thing about it is that we 've only given the software one instance of how he thinks about " disappear . " 
As there is a machine learning algorithm in this -- Thank you . 
Good job . Good job . 
Thank you , Evan , you 're a wonderful , wonderful example of the technology . 
So , as you can see , before , there is a leveling system built into this software so that as Evan , or any user , becomes more familiar with the system , they can continue to add more and more detections , so that the system begins to differentiate between different distinct thoughts . 
And once you 've trained up the detections , these thoughts can be assigned or mapped to any computing platform , application or device . 
So I 'd like to show you a few examples , because there are many possible applications for this new interface . 
In games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can naturally and intuitively be used to control an avatar or virtual character . 
Obviously , you can experience the fantasy of magic and control the world with your mind . 
And also , colors , lighting , sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you 're having , in real time . 
And moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world , with robots and simple machines , for example -- in this case , flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking " lift " with your mind . 
The technology can also be applied to real world applications -- in this example , a smart home . 
You know , from the user interface of the control system to opening curtains or closing curtains . 
And of course , also to the lighting -- turning them on or off . 
And finally , to real life - changing applications , such as being able to control an electric wheelchair . 
In this example , facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands . 
Man : Now blink right to go right . 
Now blink left to turn back left . 
Now smile to go straight . 
TL : We really -- Thank you . 
We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today , and with the community 's input , and also with the involvement of developers and researchers from around the world , we hope that you can help us to shape where the technology goes from here . Thank you so much .

Nathan Myhrvold and team 's latest inventions -- as brilliant as they are bold -- remind us that the world needs wild creativity to tackle big problems like malaria . And just as that idea sinks in , he rolls out a live demo of a new , mosquito - zapping gizmo you have to see to believe .

Nathan Myhrvold : Could this laser zap malaria ? 
We invent . 
My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas . 
And we do that for a couple of reasons . 
We invent for fun -- invention is a lot of fun to do -- and we also invent for profit . 
The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it is n't fun , you would n't have the time to do it . 
So we do this fun and profit - oriented inventing for most of what we do , but we also have a program where we invent for humanity -- where we take some of our best inventors , and we say , " Are there problems where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has ? " -- and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems , which is with dramatic , crazy , out - of - the - box solutions . 
Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours that work on these problems and he also funds this work , so thank you . 
So I 'm going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we 've got some solutions underway . 
Vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health , a fantastic thing . 
But in the developing world a lot of vaccines spoil before they 're administered , and that 's because they need to be kept cold . 
Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures . 
They go bad very quickly if you do n't , and if you do n't have stable power grid , this does n't happen , so kids die . 
It 's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters ; it 's the fact that those kids do n't get vaccinated . 
This is one of the ways that vaccines are carried : These are Styrofoam chests . These are being carried by people , but they 're also put on the backs of pickup trucks . 
We 've got a different solution . 
Now , one of these Styrofoam chests will last for about four hours with ice in it . 
And we thought , well , that 's not really good enough . 
So we made this thing . 
This lasts six months with no power ; absolutely zero power , because it loses less than a half a watt . 
Now , this is our second generations prototype . 
The third generation prototype is , right now , in Uganda being tested . 
Now , the reason we were able to come up with this is two key ideas : One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar , something you 'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in . 
They have incredible insulation , so let 's put some incredible insulation here . 
The other idea is kind of interesting , which is , you ca n't reach inside anymore . 
Because if you open it up and reach inside , you 'd let the heat in , the game would be over . 
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine . 
It vends out little individual vials . 
So a simple idea , which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed in Africa and around the world . 
We 'll move on to malaria . 
Malaria is one of the great public health problems . 
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this . 
Two hundred million people a year . 
Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies ; 27 will die during my talk . 
And there 's no way for us here in this country to grasp really what that means to the people involved . 
Another comment of Esther 's was that we react when there 's a tragedy like Haiti , but that tragedy is ongoing . 
So what can we do about it ? 
Well , there are a lot of things people have tried for many years for solving malaria . 
You can spray ; the problem is there are environmental issues . 
You can try to treat people and create awareness . 
That 's great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they do n't have health care systems . 
A vaccine would be a terrific thing , only they do n't work yet . 
People have tried for a long time . There are a couple of interesting candidates . 
It 's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for . 
You can distribute bed nets , and bed nets are very effective if you use them . 
You do n't always use them for that . People fish with them . 
They do n't always get to everyone . 
And bed nets have an effect on the epidemic , but you 're never going to make it extinct with bed nets . 
Now , malaria is an incredibly complicated disease . 
We could spend hours going over this . 
It 's got this sort of soap opera - like lifestyle ; they have sex , they burrow into your liver , they tunnel into your blood cells ... 
it 's an incredibly complicated disease , but that 's actually one of the things we find interesting about it and why we work on malaria : There 's a lot of potential ways in . 
One of those ways might be better diagnosis . 
So we hope this year to prototype each of these devices . 
One does an automatic malaria diagnosis in the same way that a diabetic 's glucose meter works : You take a drop of blood , you put it in there and it automatically tells you . 
Today , you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure , create a bunch of microscope slides and have a trained person examine it . 
The other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you did n't have to draw the blood . 
And if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your nail beds . 
Because if you actually look through your fingernails , you can see blood vessels , and once you see blood vessels , we think we can see the malaria . 
We can see it because of this molecule called hemozoin . 
It 's produced by the malaria parasite and it 's a very interesting crystalline substance . 
Interesting , anyway , if you 're a solid - state physicist . 
There 's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it . 
This is our femtosecond laser lab . 
So this creates pulses of light that last a femtosecond . 
That 's really , really , really short . 
This is a pulse of light that 's only about one wavelength of light long , so it 's a whole bunch of photons all coming and hitting simultaneously . 
It creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ; in particular , it lets you find hemozoin . 
So here 's an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are inside those red blood cells . 
And using both this technique and other optical techniques , we think we can make those diagnostics . 
We also have another hemozoin - oriented therapy for malaria : a way , in acute cases , to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system . 
Sort of like doing dialysis , but for relieving the parasite load . 
This is our thousand - core supercomputer . 
We 're kind of software guys , and so nearly any problem that you pose , we like to try to solve with some software . 
One of the problems that you have if you 're trying to eradicate malaria or reduce it is you do n't know what 's the most effective thing to do . 
Okay , we heard about bed nets earlier . 
You spend a certain amount per bed net . 
Or you could spray . 
You can give drug administration . 
There 's all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness . 
How can you tell ? 
So we 've created , using our supercomputer , the world 's best computer model of malaria , which we 'll show you now . 
We picked Madagascar . 
We have every road , every village , every , almost , square inch of Madagascar . 
We have all of the precipitation data and the temperature data . 
That 's very important because the humidity and precipitation tell you whether you 've got standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed . 
So that sets the stage on which you do this . 
You then have to introduce the mosquitoes , and you have to model that and how they come and go . 
Ultimately , it gives you this . 
This is malaria spreading across Madagascar . 
And this is this latter part of the rainy season . 
We 're going to the dry season now . 
It nearly goes away in the dry season , because there 's no place for the mosquitoes to breed . 
And then , of course , the next year it comes roaring back . 
By doing these kinds of simulations , we want to eradicate or control malaria thousands of times in software before we actually have to do it in real life ; to be able to simulate both the economic trade - offs -- how many bed nets versus how much spraying ? -- or the social trade - offs -- what happens if unrest breaks out ? 
We also try to study our foe . 
This is a high - speed camera view of a mosquito . 
And , in a moment , we 're going to see a view of the airflow . 
Here , we 're trying to visualize the airflow around the wings of the mosquito with little particles we 're illuminating with a laser . 
By understanding how mosquitoes fly , we hope to understand how to make them not fly . 
Now , one of the ways you can make them not fly is with DDT . 
This is a real ad . 
This is one of those things you just ca n't make up . 
Once upon a time , this was the primary technique , and , in fact , many countries got rid of malaria through DDT . 
The United States did . 
In 1935 , there were 150,000 cases a year of malaria in the United States , but DDT and a massive public health effort managed to squelch it . 
So we thought , " Well , we 've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium , the parasite involved . 
What can we do to the mosquito ? 
Well , let 's try to kill it with consumer electronics . " 
Now , that sounds silly , but each of these devices has something interesting in it that maybe you could use . 
Your Blu - ray player has a very cheap blue laser . 
Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that 's used to steer a laser beam very accurately ; that 's what makes those little dots on the page . 
And , of course , there 's signal processing and digital cameras . 
So what if we could put all that together to shoot them out of the sky with lasers ? 
Now , in our company , this is what we call " the pinky - suck moment . " 
What if we could do that ? 
Now , just suspend disbelief for a moment , and let 's think of what could happen if we could do that . 
Well , we could protect very high - value targets like clinics . 
Clinics are full of people that have malaria . 
They 're sick , and so they 're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes . 
You really want to protect them . 
Of course , if you do that , you could also protect your backyard . 
And farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to Whole Foods because our photons are 100 percent organic . 
They 're completely natural . 
Now , it actually gets better than this . 
You could , if you 're really smart , you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug before you zap it , and you could listen to the wing beat frequency and you could measure the size . 
And then you could decide : " Is this an insect I want to kill , or an insect I do n't want to kill ? " 
Moore 's law made computing cheap ; so cheap we can weigh the life of an individual insect and decide thumbs up or thumbs down . 
Now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes . 
They 're the only ones that are dangerous . 
Mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs . 
Mosquitoes actually live ... their day - to - day nutrition comes from nectar , from flowers -- in fact , in the lab , we feed ours raisins -- but the female needs the blood meal . 
So , this sounds really crazy , right ? 
Would you like to see it ? 
Audience : Yeah ! 
Nathan Myhrvold : Okay , so our legal department prepared a disclaimer , and here it is . 
Now , after thinking about this a little bit we thought , you know , it probably would be simpler to do this with a nonlethal laser . 
So , Eric Johanson , who built the device , actually , with parts from eBay ; and Pablos Holman over here , he 's got mosquitoes in the tank . 
We have the device over here . 
And we 're going to show you , instead of the kill laser , which will be a very brief , instantaneous pulse , we 're going to have a green laser pointer that 's going to stay on the mosquito for , actually , quite a long period of time ; otherwise , you ca n't see it very well . 
Take it away Eric . 
Eric Johanson : What we have here is a tank on the other side of the stage . 
And we have ... this computer screen can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around . 
And Pablos , if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit we can see them flying around . 
Now , that 's a fairly straightforward image processing routine , and let me show you how it works . 
Here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they 're flying around , which is kind of fun . 
Next we can actually light them up with a laser . 
Now , this is a low powered laser , and we can actually pick up a wing - beat frequency . 
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around . 
NM : That 's a mosquito wing beat you 're hearing . 
EJ : Finally , let 's see what this looks like . 
There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around , being lit up . 
This is slowed way down so that you have an opportunity to see what 's happening . 
Here we have it running at high - speed mode . 
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this , and we 're looking very hard at how to make it highly cost - effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world . 
NM : So it would n't be any fun to show you that without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em . 
This is very satisfying . 
This is one of the first ones we did . 
The energy 's a little bit high here . 
We 'll loop around here in just a second , and you 'll see another one . 
Here 's another one . Bang . 
An interesting thing is , we kill them all the time ; we 've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair . 
The wing motor is very resilient . 
I mean , here we 're blowing wings off but the wing motor keeps all the way down . 
So , that 's what I have . Thanks very much .

If you 've been in a restaurant kitchen , you 've seen how much food , water and energy can be wasted there . Chef Arthur Potts - Dawson shares his very personal vision for drastically reducing restaurant , and supermarket , waste -- creating recycling , composting , sustainable engines for good . 
business , culture , entertainment , food , global issues , sustainability 
1020 
Arthur Potts Dawson : A vision for sustainable restaurants 
Restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wasteful industry in the world . 
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today , 10 calories are taken to produce it . 
That 's a lot . 
I want to take something rather humble to discuss . 
I found this in the farmers ' market today , and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later , you 're very welcome to . 
The humble potato -- and I 've spent a long time , 25 years , preparing these . 
And it pretty much goes through eight different forms in its lifetime . 
First of all , it 's planted , and that takes energy . 
It grows and is nurtured . 
It 's then harvested . 
It 's then distributed , and distribution is a massive issue . 
It 's then sold and bought , and it 's then delivered to me . 
I basically take it , prepare it , and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it . 
The last stage is basically waste , and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it . 
There are different types of waste . 
There 's a waste of time ; there 's a waste of space ; there 's a waste of energy ; and there 's a waste of waste . 
And every business I 've been working on over the past five years , I 'm trying to lower each one of these elements . 
Okay , so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like . 
Basically a restaurant just like any other . 
This is the restaurant , Acorn House . 
Front and back . 
So let me run you through a few ideas . 
Floor : sustainable , recyclable . 
Chairs : recycled and recyclable . 
Tables : Forestry Commission . 
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood . 
This bench , although it was uncomfortable for my mom -- she did n't like sitting on it , so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale -- reusing , a job that was pretty good . 
I hate waste , especially walls . 
If they 're not working , put a shelf on it , which I did , and that shows all the customers my products . 
The whole business is run on sustainable energy . 
This is powered by wind . All of the lights are daylight bulbs . 
Paint is all low - volume chemical , which is very important when you 're working in the room all the time . 
I was experimenting with these -- I do n't know if you can see it -- but there 's a work surface there . 
And that 's a plastic polymer . 
And I was thinking , well I 'm trying to think nature , nature , nature . 
But I thought , no , no , experiment with resins , experiment with polymers . 
Will they outlive me ? They probably might . 
Right , here 's a reconditioned coffee machine . 
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there . 
Now reusing is vital . 
And we filter our own water . 
We put them in bottles , refrigerate them , and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again . 
Here 's a great little example . 
If you can see this orange tree , it 's actually growing in a car tire , which has been turned inside out and sewn up . 
It 's got my compost in it , which is growing an orange tree , which is great . 
This is the kitchen , which is in the same room . 
I basically created a menu that allowed people to choose the amount and volume of food that they wanted to consume . 
Rather than me putting a dish down , they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted . 
Okay , it 's a small kitchen . It 's about five square meters . 
It serves 220 people a day . 
We generate quite a lot of waste . 
This is the waste room . 
You ca n't get rid of waste . 
But this story 's not about eliminating it , it 's about minimizing it . 
In here , I have produce and boxes that are unavoidable . 
I put my food waste into this dehydrating , desiccating macerator -- turns food into an inner material , which I can store and then compost later . 
I compost it in this garden . 
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food , which is generated by the restaurant , and it 's growing in these tubs , which I made out of storm - felled trees and wine casks and all kinds of things . 
Three compost bins -- go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good , makes fantastic compost . 
A couple of wormeries in there too . 
And actually one of the wormeries was a big wormery . I had a lot of worms in it . 
And I tried taking the dried food waste , putting it to the worms , going , " There you go , dinner . " 
It was like vegetable jerky , and killed all of them . 
I do n't know how many worms [ were ] in there , but I 've got some heavy karma coming , I tell you . 
What you 're seeing here is a water filtration system . 
This takes the water out of the restaurant , runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there -- and I sort of water the garden with it . 
And I ultimately want to recycle that , put it back into the loos , maybe wash hands with it , I do n't know . 
So , water is a very important aspect . 
I started meditating on that and created a restaurant called Waterhouse . 
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no - carbon restaurant that is consuming no gas to start with , that would be great . 
I managed to do it . 
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House -- same chairs , same tables . 
They 're all English and a little bit more sustainable . 
But this is an electrical restaurant . 
The whole thing is electric , the restaurant and the kitchen . 
And it 's run on hydroelectricity , so I 've gone from air to water . 
Now it 's important to understand that this room is cooled by water , heated by water , filters its own water , and it 's powered by water . 
It literally is Waterhouse . 
The air handling system inside it -- I got rid of air - conditioning because I thought there was too much consumption going on there . 
This is basically air - handling . 
I 'm taking the temperature of the canal outside , pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism , it 's turning through these amazing sails on the roof , and that , in turn , is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant , cooling them , or heating them , as the need may be . 
And this is an English willow air diffuser , and that 's softly moving that air current through the room . 
Very advanced , no air - conditioning -- I love it . 
In the canal , which is just outside the restaurant , there is hundreds of meters of coil piping . 
This takes the temperature of the canal and turns it into this four - degrees of heat exchange . 
I have no idea how it works , but I paid a lot of money for it . 
And what 's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant lives on this boat -- it 's off - grid ; it generates all its own power . 
He 's growing all his own fruit , and that 's fantastic . 
There 's no accident in names of these restaurants . 
Acorn House is the element of wood ; Waterhouse is the element of water ; and I 'm thinking , well , I 'm going to be making five restaurants based on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities . 
I 've got water and wood . I 'm just about to do fire . 
I 've got metal and earth to come . 
So you 've got to watch your space for that . 
Okay . So this is my next project . 
Five weeks old , it 's my baby , and it 's hurting real bad . 
The People 's Supermarket . 
So basically , the restaurants only really hit people who believed in what I was doing anyway . 
What I needed to do was get food out to a broader spectrum of people . 
So people -- i.e. , perhaps , more working - class -- or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative . 
This is a social enterprise , not - for - profit cooperative supermarket . 
It really is about the social disconnect between food , communities in urban settings and their relationship to rural growers -- connecting communities in London to rural growers . 
Really important . 
So I 'm committing to potatoes ; I 'm committing to milk ; I 'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff . 
I 've kept the tiles ; I 've kept the floors ; I 've kept the trunking ; I 've got in some recycled fridges ; I 've got some recycled tills ; I 've got some recycled trolleys . 
I mean , the whole thing is is super - sustainable . 
In fact , I 'm trying and I 'm going to make this the most sustainable supermarket in the world . 
That 's zero food waste . 
And no one 's doing that just yet . 
In fact , Sainsbury 's , if you 're watching , let 's have a go . Try it on . 
I 'm going to get there before you . 
So nature does n't create waste does n't create waste as such . 
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle with waste being the end of the beginning , and that 's been something that 's been nurturing me for some time , and it 's an important statement to understand . 
If we do n't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food , think about the sustainable nature of it , then we may fail . 
But , I wanted to get up and show you that we can do it if we 're more responsible . 
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable . 
They 're here . You can see I 've done three so far ; I 've got a few more to go . 
The idea is embryonic . 
I think it 's important . 
I think that if we reduce , reuse , refuse and recycle -- right at the end there -- recycling is the last point I want to make ; but it 's the four R 's , rather than the three R 's -- then I think we 're going to be on our way . 
So these three are not perfect -- they 're ideas . 
I think that there are many problems to come , but with help , I 'm sure I 'm going to find solutions . 
And I hope you all take part . 
Thank you very much .

There are so many tiny , beautiful , funny , tragic moments in your life -- how are you going to remember them all ? Director Cesar Kuriyama shoots one second of video every day as part of an ongoing project to collect all the special bits of his life . 
art , film , life , memory , video 
1663 
Cesar Kuriyama : One second every day 
So , I 'm an artist . 
I live in New York , and I 've been working in advertising for -- ever since I left school , so about seven , eight years now , and it was draining . 
I worked a lot of late nights . I worked a lot of weekends , and I found myself never having time for all the projects that I wanted to work on on my own . 
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk by Stefan Sagmeister on TED , and it was called " The power of time off , " and he spoke about how every seven years , he takes a year off from work so he could do his own creative projects , and I was instantly inspired , and I just said , " I have to do that . I have to take a year off . 
I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family and start my own creative ideas . " 
So the first of those projects ended up being something I called " One Second Every Day . " 
Basically I 'm recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chronologically compiling these one - second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until , you know , I ca n't record them anymore . 
The purpose of this project is , one : I hate not remembering things that I 've done in the past . 
There 's all these things that I 've done with my life that I have no recollection of unless someone brings it up , and sometimes I think , " Oh yeah , that 's something that I did . " 
And something that I realized early on in the project was that if I was n't doing anything interesting , I would probably forget to record the video . 
So the day -- the first time that I forgot , it really hurt me , because it 's something that I really wanted to -- from the moment that I turned 30 , I wanted to keep this project going until forever , and having missed that one second , I realized , it just kind of created this thing in my head where I never forgot ever again . 
So if I live to see 80 years of age , I 'm going to have a five - hour video that encapsulates 50 years of my life . 
When I turn 40 , I 'll have a one - hour video that includes just my 30s . 
This has really invigorated me day - to - day , when I wake up , to try and do something interesting with my day . 
Now , one of the things that I have issues with is that , as the days and weeks and months go by , time just seems to start blurring and blending into each other and , you know , I hated that , and visualization is the way to trigger memory . 
You know , this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that I 've done . 
Even just this one second allows me to remember everything else I did that one day . 
It 's difficult , sometimes , to pick that one second . 
On a good day , I 'll have maybe three or four seconds that I really want to choose , but I 'll just have to narrow it down to one , but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway . 
It 's also kind of a protest , a personal protest , against the culture we have now where people just are at concerts with their cell phones out recording the whole concert , and they 're disturbing you . 
They 're not even enjoying the show . 
They 're watching the concert through their cell phone . 
I hate that . I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit , back in the day , and I 've decided that the best way for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life and not be that person , is to just record that one second that will allow me to trigger that memory of , " Yeah , that concert was amazing . I really loved that concert . " 
And it just takes a quick , quick second . 
I was on a three - month road trip this summer . 
It was something that I 've been dreaming about doing my whole life , just driving around the U.S. and Canada and just figuring out where to go the next day , and it was kind of outstanding . 
I actually ran out , I spent too much money on my road trip for the savings that I had to take my year off , so I had to , I went to Seattle and I spent some time with friends working on a really neat project . 
One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family , and this really tragic thing happened where my sister - in - law , her intestine suddenly strangled one day , and we took her to the emergency room , and she was , she was in really bad shape . 
We almost lost her a couple of times , and I was there with my brother every day . 
It helped me realize something else during this project , is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult . 
It 's not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we 're doing awesome things . 
Or we 're , " Oh , yeah , this party , let me take a picture . " 
But we rarely do that when we 're having a bad day , and something horrible is happening . 
And I found that it 's actually been very , very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment . 
It really helps you appreciate the good times . 
It 's not always a good day , so when you have a bad one , I think it 's important to remember it , just as much as it is important to remember the [ good ] days . 
Now one of the things that I do is I do n't use any filters , I do n't use anything to -- I try to capture the moment as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes . 
I started a rule of first person perspective . 
Early on , I think I had a couple of videos where you would see me in it , but I realized that was n't the way to go . 
The way to really remember what I saw was to record it as I actually saw it . 
Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are , would n't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this ? 
I turned 31 last week , which is there . 
I think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this . 
I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it . 
I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day . 
Personally , I 'm tired of forgetting , and this is a really easy thing to do . 
I mean , we all have HD - capable cameras in our pockets right now -- most people in this room , I bet -- and it 's something that 's -- I never want to forget another day that I 've ever lived , and this is my way of doing that , and it 'd be really interesting also to see , if you could just type in on a website , " June 18 , 2018 , " and you would just see a stream of people 's lives on that particular day from all over the world . 
And I do n't know , I think this project has a lot of possibilities , and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day , so you can never forget that that day , you lived . 
Thank you .

Theo Jansen creates new creatures 
I would like to tell you about a project which I started about 16 years ago , and it 's about making new forms of life . 
And these are made of this kind of tube -- electricity tube , we call it in Holland . 
And we can start a film about that , and we can see a little bit backwards in time . 
Narrator : Eventually , these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches . 
Theo Jansen is working hard on this evolution . 
Theo Jansen : I want to put these forms of life on the beaches . 
And they should survive over there , on their own , in the future . 
Learning to live on their own -- and it 'll take couple of more years to let them walk on their own . 
Narrator : The mechanical beasts will not get their energy from food , but from the wind . 
The wind will move feathers on their back , which will drive their feet . 
The beast walks sideways on the wet sand of the beach , with its nose pointed into the wind . 
As soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand , it stops , and walks in the opposite direction . 
Evolution has generated many species . 
This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa . 
TJ : This is a herd , and it is built according to genetical codes . 
And it is a sort of race , and each and every animal is different , and the winning codes will multiply . 
This is the wave , going from left to right . You can see this one . 
And now it goes from -- yes , now it goes from left to right . 
This is a new generation , a new family , which is able to store the winds . 
So , the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles , which are on top of that . 
And they can use that energy in case the wind falls away , and the tide is coming up , and there is still a little bit of energy to reach the dunes and save their lives , because they are drowned very easily . 
I could show you this animal . 
Thank you . 
So , the proportion of the tubes in this animal is very important for the walking . 
There are 11 numbers , which I call the 11 holy numbers . 
These are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way . 
In fact , it 's a new invention of the wheel . 
It works the same as a wheel . 
The axis of a wheel is staying on the same level , and this hip is staying on the same level as well . 
In fact , this is better than a wheel , because when you try to drive with your bicycle on the beach , you will notice it 's very hard to do . 
And the feet just step over the sand , and the wheel has to touch every piece of the ground in between . 
So , 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel , we have a new wheel . And I will show you , in the next video -- can you start it , please ? -- that very heavy loads can be moved . 
There 's a guy pushing there , behind , but can also walk on the wind very well . 
It 's 3.2 tons . 
And this is working on the stored winds in the bottles . 
It has a feeler , where it can feel obstacles and turn around . 
And that stuff , you see , is going to it the other way . 
Can I have the feeler here ? 
OK . Good . 
So , they have to survive all the dangers of the beach , and one of the big dangers is the sea . This is the sea . 
And it must feel the water of the sea . 
And this is the water feeler . 
And what 's very important is this tube . It sucks in air normally , but when it swallows water , it feels the resistance of it . 
So imagine that the animal is walking towards the sea . 
As soon as it touches the water , you should hear a sort of sound of running air . 
Yes ! So if it does n't feel , it will be drowned , OK ? 
Here , we have the brain of the animal . 
In fact , it is a step counter , and it counts the steps . 
It 's a binary step counter . 
So as soon it has been to the sea , it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here , and it knows always where it is on the beach . So it 's very simple brain . 
It says , well , there 's the sea , there are dunes , and I 'm here . 
So it 's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal . 
Thank you . 
One of the biggest enemies are the storms . 
This is a part of the nose of the Animaris Percipiere , and when the nose is fixed -- of the animal -- the whole animal is fixed . 
So when the storm is coming up , it drives a pin into the ground . 
And the nose is fixed , the whole animal is fixed . 
The wind may turn , but the animal will turn always its nose into the wind . 
Now , another couple of years , and these animals will survive on their own . 
I still have to help them a lot . 
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .

Craig Venter unveils " synthetic life " 
We 're here today to announce the first synthetic cell , a cell made by starting with the digital code in the computer , building the chromosome from four bottles of chemicals , assembling that chromosome in yeast , transplanting it into a recipient bacterial cell and transforming that cell into a new bacterial species . 
So this is the first self - replicating species that we 've had on the planet whose parent is a computer . 
It also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code . 
But we 'll talk more about the watermarks in a minute . 
This is a project that had its inception 15 years ago when our team then -- we called the institute TIGR -- was involved in sequencing the first two genomes in history . 
We did Haemophilus influenzae and then the smallest genome of a self - replicating organism , that of Mycoplasma genitalium . 
And as soon as we had these two sequences we thought , if this is supposed to be the smallest genome of a self - replicating species , could there be even a smaller genome ? 
Could we understand the basis of cellular life at the genetic level ? 
It 's been a 15-year quest just to get to the starting point now to be able to answer those questions , because it 's very difficult to eliminate multiple genes from a cell . 
You can only do them one at a time . 
We decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route , even though nobody had been there before , to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life . 
That started our 15-year quest to get here . 
But before we did the first experiments , we actually asked Art Caplan 's team at the University of Pennsylvania to undertake a review of what the risks , the challenges , the ethics around creating new species in the laboratory were because it had n't been done before . 
They spent about two years reviewing that independently and published their results in Science in 1999 . 
Ham and I took two years off as a side project to sequence the human genome , but as soon as that was done we got back to the task at hand . 
In 2002 , we started a new institute , the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives , where we set out two goals : One , to understand the impact of our technology on the environment , and how to understand the environment better , and two , to start down this process of making synthetic life to understand basic life . 
In 2003 , we published our first success . 
So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison developed some new methods for making error - free DNA at a small level . 
Our first task was a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage , a virus that attacks only E. coli . 
So that was the phage phi X 174 , which was chosen for historical reasons . 
It was the first DNA phage , DNA virus , DNA genome that was actually sequenced . 
So once we realized that we could make 5,000-base pair viral - sized pieces , we thought , we at least have the means then to try and make serially lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assemble them together to make this mega base chromosome . 
So , substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially . 
There were several steps to this . There were two sides : We had to solve the chemistry for making large DNA molecules , and we had to solve the biological side of how , if we had this new chemical entity , how would we boot it up , activate it in a recipient cell . 
We had two teams working in parallel : one team on the chemistry , and the other on trying to be able to transplant entire chromosomes to get new cells . 
When we started this out , we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem , which is why we chose the smallest genome . 
And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome to a much larger one . 
And we can walk through the reasons for that , but basically the small cell took on the order of one to two months to get results from , whereas the larger , faster - growing cell takes only two days . 
So there 's only so many cycles we could go through in a year at six weeks per cycle . 
And you should know that basically 99 , probably 99 percent plus of our experiments failed . 
So this was a debugging , problem - solving scenario from the beginning because there was no recipe of how to get there . 
So , one of the most important publications we had was in 2007 . 
Carole Lartigue led the effort to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome from one bacteria to another . 
I think philosophically , that was one of the most important papers that we 've ever done because it showed how dynamic life was . 
And we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those . 
We did n't know that it was going to take us several years more to get there . 
In 2008 , we reported the complete synthesis of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome , a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code , but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome . 
We think in part , because of its slow growth and , in part , cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms to keep these events from happening . 
It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into had a nuclease , an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface , and was happy to eat the synthetic DNA that we gave it and never got transplantations . 
But at the time , that was the largest molecule of a defined structure that had been made . 
And so both sides were progressing , but part of the synthesis had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished using yeast , putting the fragments in yeast and yeast would assemble these for us . 
It 's an amazing step forward , but we had a problem because now we had the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast . 
So in addition to doing the transplant , we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome out of the eukaryotic yeast into a form where we could transplant it into a recipient cell . 
So our team developed new techniques for actually growing , cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast . 
So we took the same mycoides genome that Carole had initially transplanted , and we grew that in yeast as an artificial chromosome . 
And we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them . 
When we did these experiments , though , we could get the chromosome out of yeast but it would n't transplant and boot up a cell . 
That little issue took the team two years to solve . 
It turns out , the DNA in the bacterial cell was actually methylated , and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme , from digesting the DNA . 
So what we found is if we took the chromosome out of yeast and methylated it , we could then transplant it . 
Further advances came when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes from the recipient capricolum cell . 
And once we had done that , now we can take naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it . 
So last fall when we published the results of that work in Science , we all became overconfident and were sure we were only a few weeks away from being able to now boot up a chromosome out of yeast . 
Because of the problems with Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth about a year and a half ago , we decided to synthesize the much larger chromosome , the mycoides chromosome , knowing that we had the biology worked out on that for transplantation . 
And Dan led the team for the synthesis of this over one - million - base pair chromosome . 
But it turned out it was n't going to be as simple in the end , and it set us back three months because we had one error out of over a million base pairs in that sequence . 
So the team developed new debugging software , where we could test each synthetic fragment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type DNA . 
And we found that 10 out of the 11 100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life - forming sequence . 
We narrowed it down to one fragment ; we sequenced it and found just one base pair had been deleted in an essential gene . 
So accuracy is essential . 
There 's parts of the genome where it can not tolerate even a single error , and then there 's parts of the genome where we can put in large blocks of DNA , as we did with the watermarks , and it can tolerate all kinds of errors . 
So it took about three months to find that error and repair it . 
And then early one morning , at 6 a.m. 
we got a text from Dan saying that , now , the first blue colonies existed . 
So , it 's been a long route to get here : 15 years from the beginning . 
We felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic DNA from natural DNA . 
Early on , when you 're working in a new area of science , you have to think about all the pitfalls and things that could lead you to believe that you had done something when you had n't , and , even worse , leading others to believe it . 
So , we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome , leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell , when it would have been just a contaminant . 
So early on , we developed the notion of putting in watermarks in the DNA to absolutely make clear that the DNA was synthetic . 
And the first chromosome we built in 2008 -- the 500,000-base pair one -- we simply assigned the names of the authors of the chromosome into the genetic code , but it was using just amino acid single letter translations , which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet . 
So the team actually developed a new code within the code within the code . 
So it 's a new code for interpreting and writing messages in DNA . 
Now , mathematicians have been hiding and writing messages in the genetic code for a long time , but it 's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists because , if you write long messages with the code that the mathematicians developed , it would more than likely lead to new proteins being synthesized with unknown functions . 
So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed actually puts frequent stop codons , so it 's a different alphabet but allows us to use the entire English alphabet with punctuation and numbers . 
So , there are four major watermarks all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code . 
The first one actually contains within it this code for interpreting the rest of the genetic code . 
So in the remaining information , in the watermarks , contain the names of , I think it 's 46 different authors and key contributors to getting the project to this stage . 
And we also built in a website address so that if somebody decodes the code within the code within the code , they can send an email to that address . 
So it 's clearly distinguishable from any other species , having 46 names in it , its own web address . 
And we added three quotations , because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work . 
So we wo n't give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quotations . 
The first is , " To live , to err , to fall , to triumph and to recreate life out of life . " 
It 's a James Joyce quote . 
The second quotation is , " See things not as they are , but as they might be . " 
It 's a quote from the " American Prometheus " book on Robert Oppenheimer . 
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote : " What I can not build , I can not understand . " 
So , because this is as much a philosophical advance as a technical advance in science , we tried to deal with both the philosophical and the technical side . 
The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we 've done -- asking for ethical review , pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side -- this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community , in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government . 
Even with this announcement , as we did in 2003 -- that work was funded by the Department of Energy , so the work was reviewed at the level of the White House , trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it . 
And they came down on the side of open publication , which is the right approach -- we 've briefed the White House , we 've briefed members of Congress , we 've tried to take and push the policy issues in parallel with the scientific advances . 
So with that , I would like to open it first to the floor for questions . 
Yes , in the back . 
Reporter : Could you explain , in layman 's terms , how significant a breakthrough this is please ? 
Craig Venter : Can we explain how significant this is ? 
I 'm not sure we 're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is . 
It 's significant to us . 
Perhaps it 's a giant philosophical change in how we view life . 
We actually view it as a baby step in terms of , it 's taken us 15 years to be able to do the experiment we wanted to do 15 years ago on understanding life at its basic level . 
But we actually believe this is going to be a very powerful set of tools and we 're already starting in numerous avenues to use this tool . 
We have , at the Institute , ongoing funding now from NIH in a program with Novartis to try and use these new synthetic DNA tools to perhaps make the flu vaccine that you might get next year . 
Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these , Dan 's team can now make these in less than 24 hours . 
So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out , we think we can shorten that process quite substantially . 
In the vaccine area , Synthetic Genomics and the Institute are forming a new vaccine company because we think these tools can affect vaccines to diseases that have n't been possible to date , things where the viruses rapidly evolve , such with rhinovirus . 
Would n't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds ? 
Or , more importantly , HIV , where the virus evolves so quickly the vaccines that are made today ca n't keep up with those evolutionary changes . 
Also , at Synthetic Genomics , we 've been working on major environmental issues . 
I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf is a reminder . 
We ca n't see CO2 -- we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it -- but we can see pre - CO2 now floating on the waters and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf . 
We need some alternatives for oil . 
We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources , make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries to make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of CO2 . 
Those are just a couple of the approaches and directions that we 're taking .

Lesley Hazleton : On reading the Koran 
You may have heard about the Koran 's idea of paradise being 72 virgins , and I promise I will come back to those virgins . 
But in fact , here in the northwest , we 're living very close to the real Koranic idea of paradise , defined 36 times as " gardens watered by running streams . " 
Since I live on a houseboat on the running stream of Lake Union , this makes perfect sense to me . 
But the thing is , how come it 's news to most people ? 
I know many well - intentioned non - Muslims who 've begun reading the Koran , but given up , disconcerted by its " otherness . " 
The historian Thomas Carlyle considered Muhammad one of the world 's greatest heroes , yet even he called the Koran " as toilsome reading as I ever undertook , a wearisome , confused jumble . " 
Part of the problem , I think , is that we imagine that the Koran can be read as we usually read a book -- as though we can curl up with it on a rainy afternoon with a bowl of popcorn within reach , as though God -- and the Koran is entirely in the voice of God speaking to Muhammad -- were just another author on the bestseller list . 
Yet the fact that so few people do actually read the Koran is precisely why it 's so easy to quote -- that is , to misquote . 
Phrases and snippets taken out of context in what I call the " highlighter version , " which is the one favored by both Muslim fundamentalists and anti - Muslim Islamophobes . 
So this past spring , as I was gearing up to begin writing a biography of Muhammad , I realized I needed to read the Koran properly -- as properly as I could , that is . 
My Arabic 's reduced by now to wielding a dictionary , so I took four well - known translations and decided to read them side - by - side , verse - by - verse along with a transliteration and the original seventh - century Arabic . 
Now I did have an advantage . 
My last book was about the story behind the Shi'a - Sunni split , and for that I 'd worked closely with the earliest Islamic histories , so I knew the events to which the Koran constantly refers , its frame of reference . 
I knew enough , that is , to know that I 'd be a tourist in the Koran -- an informed one , an experienced one even , but still an outsider , an agnostic Jew reading some else 's holy book . 
So I read slowly . 
I 'd set aside three weeks for this project , and that , I think , is what is meant by " hubris " -- -- because it turned out to be three months . 
I did resist the temptation to skip to the back where the shorter and more clearly mystical chapters are . 
But every time I thought I was beginning to get a handle on the Koran -- that feeling of " I get it now " -- it would slip away overnight , and I 'd come back in the morning wondering if I was n't lost in a strange land , and yet the terrain was very familiar . 
The Koran declares that it comes to renew the message of the Torah and the Gospels . 
So one - third of it reprises the stories of Biblical figures like Abraham , Moses , Joseph , Mary , Jesus . 
God himself was utterly familiar from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh -- jealously insisting on no other gods . 
The presence of camels , mountains , desert wells and springs took me back to the year I spent wandering the Sinai Desert . 
And then there was the language , the rhythmic cadence of it , reminding me of evenings spent listening to Bedouin elders recite hours - long narrative poems entirely from memory . 
And I began to grasp why it 's said that the Koran is really the Koran only in Arabic . 
Take the Fatihah , the seven - verse opening chapter that is the Lord 's Prayer and the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined . 
It 's just 29 words in Arabic , but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation . 
And yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing . 
The Arabic has an incantatory , almost hypnotic , quality that begs to be heard rather than read , felt more than analyzed . 
It wants to be chanted out loud , to sound its music in the ear and on the tongue . 
So the Koran in English is a kind of shadow of itself , or as Arthur Arberry called his version , " an interpretation . " 
But all is not lost in translation . 
As the Koran promises , patience is rewarded , and there are many surprises -- a degree of environmental awareness , for instance , and of humans as mere stewards of God 's creation , unmatched in the Bible . 
And where the Bible is addressed exclusively to men , using the second and third person masculine , the Koran includes women -- talking , for instance , of believing men and believing women , honorable men and honorable women . 
Or take the infamous verse about killing the unbelievers . 
Yes , it does say that , but in a very specific context : the anticipated conquest of the sanctuary city of Mecca where fighting was usually forbidden , and the permission comes hedged about with qualifiers . 
Not " You must kill unbelievers in Mecca , " but you can , you are allowed to , but only after a grace period is over and only if there 's no other pact in place and only if they try to stop you getting to the Kaaba , and only if they attack you first . 
And even then -- God is merciful ; forgiveness is supreme -- and so , essentially , better if you do n't . 
This was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexible the Koran is , at least in minds that are not fundamentally inflexible . 
" Some of these verses are definite in meaning , " it says , " and others are ambiguous . " 
The perverse at heart will seek out the ambiguities , trying to create discord by pinning down meanings of their own . 
Only God knows the true meaning . 
The phrase " God is subtle " appears again and again , and indeed , the whole of the Koran is far more subtle than most of us have been led to believe . 
As in , for instance , that little matter of virgins and paradise . 
Old - fashioned Orientalism comes into play here . 
The word used four times is Houris , rendered as dark - eyed maidens with swelling breasts , or as fair , high - bosomed virgins . 
Yet all there is in the original Arabic is that one word : Houris . 
Not a swelling breast nor a high bosom in sight . 
Now this may be a way of saying " pure beings " -- like in angels -- or it may be like the Greek Kouros or Kórē , an eternal youth . 
But the truth is nobody really knows , and that 's the point . 
Because the Koran is quite clear when it says that you 'll be " a new creation in paradise " and that you will be " recreated in a form unknown to you , " which seems to me a far more appealing prospect than a virgin . 
And that number 72 never appears . 
There are no 72 virgins in the Koran . 
That idea only came into being 300 years later , and most Islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps . 
Paradise is quite the opposite . 
It 's not virginity ; it 's fecundity . 
It 's plenty . 
It 's gardens watered by running streams . 
Thank you .

With a dusty backhoe , a handful of Japanese paint markers and a few students in tow , Deborah Gordon digs up ant colonies in the Arizona desert in search of keys to understanding complex systems .

Deborah Gordon digs ants 
I study ants , and that 's because I like to think about how organizations work . 
And in particular , how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization . 
So , ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that , and there are many others . The web is one . 
There are many biological systems like that -- brains , cells , developing embryos . 
There are about 10,000 species of ants . 
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens , and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers . 
And all ant colonies have in common that there 's no central control . 
Nobody tells anybody what to do . 
The queen just lays the eggs . There 's no management . 
No ant directs the behavior of any other ant . 
And I try to figure out how that works . 
And I 've been working for the past 20 years on a population of seed - eating ants in southeastern Arizona . 
Here 's my study site . This is really a picture of ants , and the rabbit just happens to be there . 
And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds . 
This is the nest of the mature colony , and there 's the nest entrance . 
And they forage maybe for about 20 meters away , gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest , and store them . 
And every year I go there and make a map of my study site . 
This is just a road . And it 's not very big : it 's about 250 meters on one side , 400 on the other . 
And every colony has a name , which is a number , which is painted on a rock . And I go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before , and figure out which ones have died , and put all the new ones on the map . 
And by doing this I know how old they all are . 
And because of that , I 've been able to study how their behavior changes as the colony gets older and larger . 
So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony . 
Ants never make more ants ; colonies make more colonies . 
And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives -- those are the ones with wings -- on a mating flight . 
So every year , on the same day -- and it 's a mystery exactly how that happens -- each colony sends out its virgin , unmated queens with wings , and the males , and they all fly to a common place . And they mate . 
And this shows a recently virgin queen . Here 's her wings . 
And she 's in the process of mating with this male , and there 's another male on top waiting his turn . 
Often the queens mate more than once . 
And after that , the males all die . That 's it for them . 
And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere , drop their wings , dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs . 
And they will live for 15 or 20 years , continuing to lay eggs using the sperm from that original mating . 
So the queen goes down in there . 
She lays eggs , she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg , then it 's a larva . 
She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves . 
Then , as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emerge , they 're larvae . Then they 're pupae . Then they come out as adult ants . 
They go out , they get the food , they dig the nest , and the queen never comes out again . 
So this is a one - year - old colony -- this happens to be 536 . 
There 's the nest entrance , there 's a pencil for scale . 
So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer . 
This is a three - year - old colony . 
There 's the nest entrance , there 's a pencil for scale . 
They make a midden , a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat . 
This is a five - year - old colony . This is the nest entrance , here 's a pencil for scale . 
This is about as big as they get , about a meter across . 
And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes -- so this is about 10,000 worker ants -- changes as a function of colony age , in years . 
So it starts out with zero ants , just the founding queen , and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five . 
And it stays that size until the queen dies and there 's nobody to make more ants , when she 's about 15 or 20 years old . 
And it 's when they reach this stable size , in numbers of ants , that they start to reproduce . 
That is , to send more winged queens and males to that year 's mating flight . 
And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age because I 've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants . 
So that 's not the most fun part of this research , although it 's interesting . 
Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation . 
That 's not just how is the colony organized , but how does it change what it 's doing ? 
How is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change ? 
So , things happen to an ant colony . 
When it rains in the summer , it floods in the desert . 
There 's a lot of damage to the nest , and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess . 
When extra food becomes available -- and this is what everybody knows about picnics -- then extra ants are allocated to collect the food . 
So , with nobody telling anybody what to do , how is it that the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task ? 
And that 's the process that I call task allocation . 
And in harvester ants , I divide the tasks of the ants I see just outside the nest into these four categories : where an ant is foraging , when it 's out along the foraging trail , searching for food or bringing food back . 
The patrollers -- that 's supposed to be a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group that go out early in the morning before the foragers are active . 
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go , and by coming back -- just by making it back -- they tell the foragers that it 's safe to go out . 
Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest , and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman 's house . 
That is , that there are chambers inside , they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe - like surface in it . 
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings of the Hopi people that are in that area . 
And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest , and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles . 
So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand , put it down , turn around , and go back in . 
And finally , the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage . 
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse . 
On one day , it 'll all be here , and then the next day they 'll move it over there , and then they 'll move it back . 
So that 's what the midden workers do . 
And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest . 
So that 's only about 25 percent of the colony , and they 're the oldest ants . 
So , an ant starts out somewhere near the queen . 
And when we dig up nests we find they 're about as deep as the colony is wide , so about a meter deep for the big old nests . 
And then there 's another long tunnel and a chamber , where we often find the queen , after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes . 
I do n't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe and my crew of students with pickaxes , but instead because when there 's flooding , occasionally the colony has to go down deep . 
So there 's this whole network of chambers . 
The queen 's in there somewhere ; she just lays eggs . 
There 's the larvae , and they consume most of the food . 
And this is true of most ants -- that the ants you see walking around do n't do much eating . 
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae . 
When the foragers come in with food , they just drop it into the upper chamber , and other ants come up from below , get the food , bring it back , husk the seeds , and pile them up . 
There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest . 
And curiously , and interestingly , it looks as though at any time about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing . 
So , despite what it says in the Bible , about , you know , " Look to the ant , thou sluggard , " in fact , you could think of those ants as reserves . 
That is to say , if something happened -- and I 've never seen anything like this happen , but I 've only been looking for 20 years -- if something happened , they might all come out if they were needed . 
But in fact , mostly they 're just hanging around in there . 
And I think it 's a very interesting question -- what is there about the way the colony is organized that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing ? 
And they sort of stand as a buffer in between the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside . 
And if you mark ants that are working outside , and dig up a colony , you never see them deep down . 
So what 's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they 're younger . 
They somehow get into this reserve . 
And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce . 
And once they belong to the ants that work outside , they never go back down . 
Now ants -- most ants , including these , do n't see very well . 
They have eyes , they can distinguish between light and dark , but they mostly work by smell . 
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought about ant queens is n't true -- you know , even if the queen did have the intelligence to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers to tell the ants outside what to do , there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest . 
So that 's one way that we know the queen is n't directing the behavior of the colony . 
So when I first set out to work on task allocation , my first question was , " What 's the relationship between the ants doing different tasks ? 
Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing ? 
Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing ? " 
And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant was somehow dedicated to its task from birth and sort of performed independently of the others , knowing its place on the assembly line . 
And instead I wanted to ask , " How are the different task groups interdependent ? " 
So I did experiments where I changed one thing . 
So for example , I created more work for the nest maintenance workers by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance , early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active . 
This is what it looks like about 20 minutes later . 
Here it is about 40 minutes later . 
And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there . 
And what I wanted to know was , " OK , here 's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited -- is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks ? " 
Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked . 
So here 's some blue nest maintenance workers . 
And lately we 've gotten more sophisticated and we have this three - color system . 
And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which . 
We started out with model airplane paint and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers , and they work really well . 
And so just to summarize the result , well it turns out that yes , the different tasks are interdependent . 
So , if I change the numbers performing one task , it changes the numbers performing another . 
So for example , if I make a mess that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up , then I see fewer ants out foraging . 
And this was true for all the pair - wise combinations of tasks . 
And the second result , which was surprising to a lot of people , was that ants actually switch tasks . 
The same ant does n't do the same task over and over its whole life . 
So for example , if I put out extra food , everybody else -- the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food , they become foragers . 
The nest maintenance workers become foragers . 
The patrollers become foragers . 
But not every transition is possible . And this shows how it works . 
Like I just said , if there is more food to collect , the patrollers , the midden workers , the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage . 
If there 's more patrolling to do -- so I created a disturbance , so extra patrollers were needed -- the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol . 
But if more nest maintenance work is needed -- for example , if I put out a bunch of toothpicks -- then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance , they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest . 
So foraging acts as a sink , and the ants inside the nest act as a source . 
And finally , it looks like each ant is deciding moment to moment whether to be active or not . 
So , for example , when there 's extra nest maintenance work to do , it 's not that the foragers switch over . I know that they do n't do that . 
But the foragers somehow decide not to come out . 
And here was the most intriguing result : the task allocation . 
This process changes with colony age , and it changes like this . 
When I do these experiments with older colonies -- so ones that are five years or older -- they 're much more consistent from one time to another and much more homeostatic . The worse things get , the more I hassle them , the more they act like undisturbed colonies . 
Whereas the young , small colonies -- the two - year - old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable . 
And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year . 
It could be this year , or this year . 
So , the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the younger colony . 
It 's not due to the experience of older , wiser ants . 
Instead , something about the organization must be changing as the colony gets older . 
And the obvious thing that 's changing is its size . 
So since I 've had this result , I 've spent a lot of time trying to figure out what kinds of decision rules -- very simple , local , probably olfactory , chemical rules could an ant could be using , since no ant can assess the global situation -- that would have the outcome that I see , these predictable dynamics , in who does what task . 
And it would change as the colony gets larger . 
And what I 've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact . 
So anybody who 's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae . 
They smell with their antennae . 
When one ant touches another , it 's smelling it , and it can tell , for example , whether the other ant is a nest mate because ants cover themselves and each other , through grooming , with a layer of grease , which carries a colony - specific odor . 
And what we 're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts , the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks , in deciding what to do . 
And so what the message is , is not any message that they transmit from one ant to another , but the pattern . 
The pattern itself is the message . 
And I 'll tell you a little bit more about that . 
But first you might be wondering : how is it that an ant can tell , for example , I 'm a forager . 
I expect to meet another forager every so often . 
But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers , I 'm less likely to forage . 
So it has to know the difference between a forager and a nest maintenance worker . 
And we 've learned that , in this species -- and I suspect in others as well -- these hydrocarbons , this layer of grease on the outside of ants , is different as ants perform different tasks . 
And we 've done experiments that show that that 's because the longer an ant stays outside , the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change , and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks . 
And they can use that task - specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons -- they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow keep track of the rate at which they 're meeting ants of certain tasks . 
And we 've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads , and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate . 
And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it , as they would to contact with real ants . 
So I want now to show you a bit of film -- and this will start out , first of all , showing you the nest entrance . 
So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance . 
They 've gone out to do different tasks , and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines , or influences , each ant 's decision about whether to go out , and which task to perform . 
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope . It 's down inside the nest . 
In the beginning you see the ants just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope . 
But the idea is that the ants are in there , and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it -- a stream of contacts with other ants . 
And the pattern of these interactions determines whether the ant comes back out , and what it does when it comes back out . 
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these . 
Each ant , then , as it comes back in , is contacting other ants . 
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance to decide whether to go out on their next trip , are contacting the ants coming in . 
So , what 's interesting about this system is that it 's messy . 
It 's variable . It 's noisy . And , in particular , in two ways . 
The first is that the experience of the ant -- of each ant -- ca n't be very predictable . 
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside . 
And the second thing is that an ant 's ability to assess this pattern must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting . 
So , we do a lot of simulation and modeling , and also experimental work , to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to , in the aggregate , produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies . 
Again , I do n't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork . 
In fact , if you watch ants at all , you end up trying to help them because they never seem to be doing anything exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it . 
So it 's not really that out of these haphazard contacts , perfection arises . 
But it works pretty well . 
Ants have been around for several hundred million years . 
They cover the earth , except for Antarctica . 
Something that they 're doing is clearly successful enough that this pattern of haphazard contacts , in the aggregate , produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants . 
And one of the things that we 're studying is how natural selection might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns -- this network of interaction patterns -- to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies . 
So the one thing , though , that I want you to remember about this is that these patterns of interactions are something that you 'd expect to be closely connected to colony size . 
The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony -- and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule , like " I expect to meet another forager every three seconds . " 
But in a small colony , it 's likely to meet fewer foragers , just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet . 
So this is the kind of rule that , as the colony develops and gets older and larger , will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one . 
Thank you .

MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld talks about his Fab Lab -- a low - cost lab that lets people build things they need using digital and analog tools . It 's a simple idea with powerful results .

Neil Gershenfeld on Fab Labs 
This meeting has really been about a digital revolution , but I 'd like to argue that it 's done ; we won . 
We 've had a digital revolution but we do n't need to keep having it . 
And I 'd like to look after that , to look what comes after the digital revolution . 
So , let me start projecting forward . 
These are some projects I 'm involved in today at MIT , looking what comes after computers . 
This first one , Internet Zero , up here -- this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag -- about a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob , and this is getting commercialized very quickly . 
And what 's interesting about it is n't the cost ; it 's the way it encodes the Internet . 
It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet so you could send it optically ; you can communicate acoustically through a power line , through RF . 
It takes the original principle of the Internet , which is inter - networking computers , and now lets devices inter - network . 
That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero , this internet of devices . 
So this is the next step from there to here , and this is getting commercialized today . 
A step after that is a project on fungible computers . 
Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded . 
So , half as much grain is half as much useful , but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer , and we 've been trying to make computers that work that way . 
So , what you see in the background is a prototype . 
This was from a thesis of a student , Bill Butow , now at Intel , who wondered why , instead of making bigger and bigger chips , you do n't make small chips , put them in a viscous medium , and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch . 
And that 's what you see here . 
On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer ; on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made , but there 's no frame buffer , IO processor , any of that stuff -- it 's just this material . 
Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully , this is a raw material . 
If you add twice as much of it , you have twice as much display . 
If you shoot a gun through the middle , nothing happens . 
If you need more resource , you just apply more computer . 
So , that 's the step after this -- of computing as a raw material . 
That 's still conventional bits , the step after that is -- this is an earlier prototype in the lab ; this is high - speed video slowed down . 
Now , integrating chemistry in computation , where the bits are bubbles . 
This is showing making bits , this is showing -- once again , slowed down so you can see it , bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de - multiplexing . 
So , now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information . And , ultimately , these are some slides from an early project I did , computing where the bits are stored quantum - mechanically in the nuclei of atoms , so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules . 
All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further , not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms , and they lead to the following recognition . 
We all know we 've had a digital revolution , but what is that ? 
Well , Shannon took us , in the ' 40s , from here to here : from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the Internet . And he proved the first threshold theorem , that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal , you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device . 
And that 's when we got the Internet . 
Von Neumann , in the ' 50s , did the same thing for computing ; he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect . This was the last great analog computer at MIT : a differential analyzer , and the more you ran it , the worse the answer got . 
After Von Neumann , we have the Pentium , where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one . 
But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner . 
A state - of - the - art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal , or you maybe melt some plastic . A 10-billion - dollar chip fab uses a process a village artisan would recognize -- you spread stuff around and bake it . 
All the intelligence is external to the system ; the materials do n't have information . 
Yesterday you heard about molecular biology , which fundamentally computes to build . 
It 's an information processing system . 
We 've had digital revolutions in communication and computation , but precisely the same idea , precisely the same math Shannon and Von Neuman did , has n't yet come out to the physical world . So , inspired by that , colleagues in this program -- the Center for Bits and Atoms at MIT -- which is a group of people , like me , who never understood the boundary between physical science and computer science . I would even go further and say computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science -- -- because the canon -- computer science -- many of them are great but the canon of computer science prematurely froze a model of computation based on technology that was available in 1950 , and nature 's a much more powerful computer than that . 
So , you 'll hear , tomorrow , from Saul Griffith . He was one of the first students to emerge from this program . 
We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate . 
This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically , where you write a code , much like protein folding , that specifies their structure . 
So , there 's no feedback to a tool metrology ; the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated . So , you can , for example , do that . 
You can do other things . That 's in 2D. It works in 3D. 
The video on the upper right -- I wo n't show for time -- shows self - replication , templating so something can make something that can make something , and we 're doing that now over , maybe , nine orders of magnitude . Those ideas have been used to show the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism , in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails that code for their assembly -- so , much like the magnets , but now on nanometer scales . 
Laser micro - machining : essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate functional systems , all the way up to building buildings , not by having blueprints , but having the parts code for the structure of the building . 
So , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication . Computers that do n't control tools but computers that are tools , where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits . 
Now , to do that -- with your tax dollars , thank you -- I bought all these machines . We made a modest proposal to the NSF . We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale , all in one place , because you ca n't segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale . 
So we put together focused nano beam writers and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro - machining systems . 
But I had a problem . Once I had all these machines , I was spending too much time teaching students to use them . 
So I started teaching a class , modestly called , " How To Make Almost Anything . " And that was n't meant to be provocative ; it was just for a few research students . 
But the first day of class looked like this . 
You know , hundreds of people came in begging , all my life I 've been waiting for this class ; I 'll do anything to do it . 
Then they 'd ask , can you teach it at MIT ? It seems too useful ? 
And then the next -- -- surprising thing was they were n't there to do research . 
They were there because they wanted to make stuff . 
They had no conventional technical background . 
At the end of a semester they integrated their skills . 
I 'll show an old video . Kelly was a sculptor , and this is what she did with her semester project . 
: Kelly : Hi , I 'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy . 
Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream , but you ca n't because you 're at work , or you 're in a classroom , or you 're watching your children , or you 're in any number of situations where it 's just not permitted ? 
Well , scream buddy is a portable space for screaming . 
When a user screams into scream buddy , their scream is silenced . 
It is also recorded for later release where , when and how the user chooses . 
So , Einstein would like this . 
This student made a web browser for parrots -- lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots . 
This student 's made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you 're awake ; this is one that defends -- a dress that defends your personal space . 
This is n't technology for communication ; it 's technology to prevent it . 
This is a device that lets you see your music . 
This is a student who made a machine that makes machines , and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing . 
Just year after year -- and I finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication is products for a market of one person . 
You do n't need this for what you can get in Wal - Mart ; you need this for what makes you unique . 
Ken Olsen famously said , nobody needs a computer in the home . 
But you do n't use it for inventory and payroll ; DEC is now twice bankrupt . You do n't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it . 
You need it for what makes you unique , just like personalization . 
So , with that , in turn , 20 million dollars today does this ; 20 years from now we 'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything . 
The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication . 
Today , when you spend that much of your money , there 's a government requirement to do outreach , which often means classes at a local school , a website -- stuff that 's just not that exciting . 
So , I made a deal with my NSF program managers that instead of talking about it , I 'd give people the tools . 
This was n't meant to be provocative or important , but we put together these Fab Labs . It 's about 20,000 dollars in equipment that approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it 's going . 
A laser cutter to do press - fit assembly with 3D from 2D , a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics , a micron scale , numerically - controlled milling machine for precise structures , programming tools for less than a dollar , 100-nanosecond microcontrollers . It lets you work from microns and microseconds on up , and they exploded around the world . 
This was n't scheduled , but they went from inner - city Boston to Pobal in India , to Secondi - Takoradi on Ghana 's coast to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa , to the far north of Norway , uncovering , or helping uncover , for all the attention to the digital divide , we would find unused computers in all these places . 
A farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify the world , not just get information about it on a screen . 
That there 's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide bigger than the digital divide . 
And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses . 
So , in place after place we saw this same progression : that we 'd open one of these Fab Labs , where we did n't -- this is too crazy to think of . 
We did n't think this up , that we would get pulled to these places ; we 'd open it . The first step was just empowerment . 
You can see it in their face , just this joy of , I can do it . 
This is a girl in inner - city Boston who had just done a high - tech on - demand craft sale in the inner city community center . 
It goes on from there to serious hands - on technical education informally , out of schools . In Ghana we had set up one of these labs . 
We designed a network sensor , and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab . 
There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night -- : Kids : I love the Fab Lab . 
-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor . 
So she insisted on fabbing the board , learning how to stuff it , learning how to program it . She did n't really know what she was doing or why she was doing it , but she knew she just had to do it . There was something electric about it . 
This is late at , you know , 11 o'clock at night and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time . 
And I 've shown this to engineers at big companies , and they say they ca n't do this . Any one thing she 's doing , they can do better , but it 's distributed over many people and many sites and they ca n't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing . 
: Girl : My name is Valentina Kofi ; I am eight years old . 
I made a stacking board . 
And , again , that was just for the joy of it . 
Then these labs started doing serious problem solving -- instrumentation for agriculture in India , steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana , high - gain antennas in thin client computers . 
And then , in turn , businesses started to grow , like making these antennas . 
And finally , the lab started doing invention . 
We 're learning more from them than we 're giving them . 
I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it . 
They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box -- which , as you see up there , that 's becoming a business -- but their design was better than Saul 's design at MIT , so there 's now three students at MIT doing their theses on scaling the work of eight - year - old children because they had better designs . 
Real invention is happening in these labs . 
And I still kept -- so , in the last year I 've been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this , and I keep saying , but this is n't the real thing . 
Wait , like , 20 years and then we 'll be done . 
And I finally got what 's been going on . This is Kernigan and Ritchie inventing UNIX on a PDP . 
PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers . 
They were tens of thousands of dollars , hard to use , but they brought computing down to work groups , and everything we do today happened there . 
These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP . 
The projection of digital fabrication is n't a projection for the future ; we are now in the PDP era . 
We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then . 
It was very chaotic , it was n't , sort of , clear what was going on . 
In the same sense we are now , today , in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication . 
The only problem with that is it breaks everybody 's boundaries . 
In DC , I go to every agency that wants to talk , you know ; in the Bay Area , I go to every organization you can think of -- they all want to talk about it , but it breaks their organizational boundaries . In fact , it 's illegal for them , in many cases , to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology . 
And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention coming from this community surprised me : it 's the social engineering . That the lab in far north of Norway -- this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground rather than the sky because that 's where the satellites are -- the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in . 
It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it , so they built this extraordinary village for the lab . 
This is n't a university ; it 's not a company . It 's essentially a village for invention ; it 's a village for the outliers in society , and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs all around the world . 
So this program has split into an NGO foundation , a Fab Foundation to support the scaling , a micro VC fund . 
The person who runs it nicely describes it as " machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses : " it 's a cross between micro - finance and VC to do fan - out , and then the research partnerships back at MIT for what 's making it possible . 
So I 'd like to leave you with two thoughts . 
There 's been a sea change in aid , from top - down mega - projects to bottom - up , grassroots , micro - finance investing in the roots , so that everybody 's got that that 's what works . 
But we still look at technology as top - down mega - projects . 
Computing , communication , energy for the rest of the planet are these top - down mega - projects . 
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough , you can solve the problems . 
The message coming from the Fab Labs is that the other five billion people on the planet are n't just technical sinks ; they 're sources . 
The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems . 
I thought that 's the projection 20 years hence into the future , but it 's where we are today . 
It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of . 
The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering , but it 's here today . 
And , finally , any talk like this on the future of computing is required to show Moore 's law , but my favorite version -- this is Gordon Moore 's original one from his original paper -- and what 's happened is , year after year after year , we 've scaled and we 've scaled and we 've scaled and we 've scaled , and we 've scaled and we 've scaled , and we 've scaled and we 've scaled , and there 's this looming bug of what 's going to happen at the end of Moore 's law ; this ultimate bug is coming . 
But we 're coming to appreciate , is the transition from 2D to 3D , from programming bits to programming atoms , turns the ends of Moore 's law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature . 
So , we 're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication , where the output of computation programs the physical world . 
So , together , these two projects answer questions I had n't asked carefully . The class at MIT shows the killer app for personal fabrication in the developed world is technology for a market of one : personal expression in technology that touches a passion unlike anything I 've seen in technology for a very long time . 
And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide : people locally developing solutions to local problems . Thank you .

The US consumes 25 % of the world 's oil -- but as energy tycoon T. Boone Pickens points out onstage , the country has no energy policy to prepare for the inevitable . Is alternative energy our bridge to an oil - free future ? After losing $ 150 million investing in wind energy , Pickens suggests it is n't , not yet . What might get us there ? Natural gas . After the talk , watch for a lively Q&A with TED Curator Chris Anderson .

T. Boone Pickens : Let 's transform energy -- with natural gas 
I 'm a believer . 
I 'm a believer in global warming , and my record is good on the subject . 
But my subject is national security . 
We have to get off of oil purchased from the enemy . 
I 'm talking about OPEC oil . 
And let me take you back 100 years to 1912 . 
You 're probably thinking that was my birth year . 
It was n't . It was 1928 . 
But go back to 1912 , 100 years ago , and look at that point what we , our country , was faced with . 
It 's the same energy question that you 're looking at today , but it 's different sources of fuel . 
A hundred years ago we were looking at coal , of course , and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil . 
At that point , we were looking for a fuel that was cleaner , it was cheaper , and it was n't ours though , it was theirs . 
So at that point , 1912 , we selected crude oil over whale oil and some more coal . 
But as we moved on to the period now , 100 years later , we 're back really at another decision point . 
What is the decision point ? 
It 's what we 're going to use in the future . 
So from here , it 's pretty clear to me , we would prefer to have cleaner , cheaper , domestic , ours -- and we have that , we have that -- which is natural gas . 
So here you are , that the cost of all this to the world is 89 million barrels of oil , give or take a few barrels , every day . 
And the cost annually is three trillion dollars . 
And one trillion of that goes to OPEC . 
That has got to be stopped . 
Now if you look at the cost of OPEC , it cost seven trillion dollars -- on the Milken Institute study last year -- seven trillion dollars since 1976 , is what we paid for oil from OPEC . 
Now that includes the cost of military and the cost of the fuel both . 
But it 's the greatest transfer of wealth , from one group to another in the history of mankind . 
And it continues . 
Now when you look at where is the transfer of wealth , you can see here that we have the arrows going into the Mid - East and away from us . 
And with that , we have found ourselves to be the world 's policemen . 
We are policing the world , and how are we doing that ? 
I know the response to this . 
I would bet there are n't 10 percent of you in the room that know how many aircraft carriers there are in the world . 
Raise your hand if you think you know . 
There are 12 . 
One is under construction by the Chinese and the other 11 belong to us . 
Why do we have 11 aircraft carriers ? 
Do we have a corner on the market ? 
Are we smarter than anybody else ? I 'm not sure . 
If you look at where they 're located -- and on this slide it 's the red blobs on there -- there are five that are operating in the Mid - East , and the rest of them are in the United States . 
They just move back to the Mid - East and those come back . 
So actually most of the 11 we have are tied up in the Mid - East . 
Why ? Why are they in the Mid - East ? 
They 're there to control , keep the shipping lanes open and make oil available . 
And the United States uses about 20 million barrels a day , which is about 25 percent of all the oil used everyday in the world . 
And we 're doing it with four percent of the population . 
Somehow that does n't seem right . 
That 's not sustainable . 
So where do we go from here ? 
Does that continue ? 
Yes , it 's going to continue . 
The slide you 're looking at here is 1990 to 2040 . 
Over that period you are going to double your demand . 
And when you look at what we 're using the oil for , 70 percent of it is used for transportation fuel . 
So when somebody says , " Let 's go more nuclear , let 's go wind , let 's go solar , " fine ; I 'm for anything American , anything American . 
But if you 're going to do anything about the dependency on foreign oil , you have to address transportation . 
So here we are using 20 million barrels a day -- producing eight , importing 12 , and from the 12 , five comes from OPEC . 
When you look at the biggest user and the second largest user , we use 20 million barrels and the Chinese use 10 . 
The Chinese have a little bit better plan -- or they have a plan ; we have no plan . 
In the history of America , we 've never had an energy plan . 
We do n't even realize the resources that we have available to us . 
If you take the last 10 years and bring forward , you 've transferred to OPEC a trillion dollars . 
If you go forward the next 10 years and cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a barrel , you will pay 2.2 trillion . 
That 's not sustainable either . 
But the days of cheap oil are over . 
They 're over . 
They make it very clear to you , the Saudis do , they have to have 94 dollars a barrel to make their social commitments . 
Now I had people in Washington last week told me , he said , " The Saudis can produce the oil for five dollars a barrel . 
That has nothing to do with it . 
It 's what they have to pay for is what we are going to pay for oil . " 
There is no free market for oil . 
The oil is priced off the margin . 
And the OPEC nations are the ones that price the oil . 
So where are we headed from here ? 
We 're headed to natural gas . 
Natural gas will do everything we want it to do . 
It 's 130 octane fuel . 
It 's 25 percent cleaner than oil . 
It 's ours , we have an abundance of it . 
And it does not require a refinery . 
It comes out of the ground at 130 octane . 
Run it through the separator and you 're ready to use it . 
It 's going to be very simple for us to use . 
It 's going to be simple to accomplish this . 
You 're going to find , and I 'll tell you in just a minute , what you 're looking for to make it happen . 
But here you can look at the list . 
Natural gas will fit all of those . 
It will replace or be able to be used for that . 
It 's for power generation , transportation , it 's peaking fuel , it 's all those . 
Do we have enough natural gas ? 
Look at the bar on the left . It 's 24 trillion . 
It 's what we use a year . 
Go forward and the estimates that you have from the EIA and onto the industry estimates -- the industry knows what they 're talking about -- we 've got 4,000 trillion cubic feet of natural gas that 's available to us . 
How does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent ? 
It would be three times what the Saudis claim they have . 
And they claim they have 250 billion barrels of oil , which I do not believe . 
I think it 's probably 175 billion barrels . 
But anyway , whether they say they 're right or whatever , we have plenty of natural gas . 
So I have tried to target on where we use the natural gas . 
And where I 've targeted is on the heavy - duty trucks . 
There are eight million of them . 
You take eight million trucks -- these are 18-wheelers -- and take them to natural gas , reduce carbon by 30 percent , it is cheaper and it will cut our imports three million barrels . 
So you will cut 60 percent off of OPEC with eight million trucks . 
There are 250 million vehicles in America . 
So what you have is natural gas is the bridge fuel , is the way I see it . 
I do n't have to worry about the bridge to where at my age . 
That 's your concern . 
But when you look at the natural gas we have it could very well be the bridge to natural gas , because you have plenty of natural gas . 
But as I said , I 'm for anything American . 
Now let me take you -- I 've been a realist -- I went from theorist early to realist . 
I 'm back to theorist again . 
If you look at the world , you have methane hydrates in the ocean around every continent . 
And here you can see methane , if that 's the way you 're going to go , that there 's plenty of methane -- natural gas is methane , methane and natural gas are interchangeable -- but if you decide that you 're going to use some methane -- and I 'm gone , so it 's up to you -- but we do have plenty of methane hydrates . 
So I think I 've made my point that we have to get on our own resources in America . 
If we do -- it 's costing us a billion dollars a day for oil . 
And yet , we have no energy plan . 
So there 's nothing going on that impresses me in Washington on that plan , other than I 'm trying to focus on that eight million 18-wheelers . 
If we could do that , I think we would take our first step to an energy plan . 
If we did , we could see that our own resources are easier to use than anybody can imagine . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Thanks for that . 
So from your point of view , you had this great Pickens Plan that was based on wind energy , and you abandoned it basically because the economics changed . 
What happened ? 
TBP : I lost 150 million dollars . 
That 'll make you abandon something . 
No , what happened to us , Chris , is that power , it 's priced off the margin . 
And so the margin is natural gas . 
And at the time I went into the wind business , natural gas was nine dollars . 
Today it 's two dollars and forty cents . 
You can not do a wind deal under six dollars an MCF . 
CA : So what happened was that , through increased ability to use fracking technology , the calculated reserves of natural gas kind of exploded and the price plummeted , which made wind uncompetitive . 
In a nutshell that 's what happened ? 
TBP : That 's what happened . 
We found out that we could go to the source rock , which were the carboniferous shales in the basins . 
The first one was Barnett Shale in Texas and then the Marcellus up in the Northeast across New York , Pennsylvania , West Virginia ; and Haynesville in Louisiana . 
This stuff is everywhere . 
We are overwhelmed with natural gas . 
CA : And now you 're a big investor in that and bringing that to market ? 
TBP : Well you say a big investor . 
It 's my life . 
I 'm a geologist , got out of school in ' 51 , and I 've been in the industry my entire life . 
Now I do own stocks . 
I 'm not a big natural gas producer . 
Somebody the other day said I was the second largest natural gas producer in the United States . 
Do n't I wish . 
But no , I 'm not . I own stocks . 
But I also am in the fueling business . 
CA : But natural gas is a fossil fuel . 
You burn it , you release CO2 . 
So you believe in the threat of climate change . 
Why does n't that prospect concern you ? 
TBP : Well you 're going to have to use something . 
What do you have to replace it ? 
CA : No , no . The argument that it 's a bridge fuel makes sense , because the amount of CO2 per unit of energy is lower than oil and coal , correct ? 
And so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas . 
But if that 's it and that becomes the reason that renewables do n't get invested in , then , long - term , we 're screwed anyway , right ? 
TBP : Well I 'm not ready to give up , but Jim and I talked there as he left , and I said , " How do you feel about natural gas ? " 
And he said , " Well it 's a bridge fuel , is what it is . " 
And I said , " Bridge to what ? 
Where are we headed ? " 
See but again , I told you , I do n't have to worry with that . 
You all do . 
CA : But I do n't think that 's right , Boone . 
I think you 're a person who believes in your legacy . 
You 've made the money you need . 
You 're one of the few people in a position to really swing the debate . 
Do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon ? 
Does that make sense ? 
TBP : I do n't like that because it ends up the government is going to run the program . 
I can tell you it will be a failure . 
The government is not successful on these things . 
They just are n't , it 's a bad deal . 
Look at Solyndra , or whatever it was . 
I mean , that was told to be a bad idea 10 times , they went ahead and did it anyway . 
But that only blew out 500 million . 
I think it 's closer to a billion . 
But Chris , I think where we 're headed , the long - term , I do n't mind going back to nuclear . 
And I can tell you what the last page of the report that will take them five years to write will be . 
One , do n't build a reformer on a fault . 
And number two , do not build a reformer on the ocean . 
And now I think reformers are safe . 
Move them inland and on very stable ground and build the reformers . 
There is n't anything wrong with nuke . 
You 're going to have to have energy . There is no question . 
You ca n't -- okay . 
CA : One of the questions from the audience is , with fracking and the natural gas process , what about the problem of methane leaking from that , methane being a worse global warming gas than CO2 ? 
Is that a concern ? 
TBP : Fracking ? What is fracking ? 
CA : Fracking . 
TBP : I 'm teasing . 
CA : We 've got a little bit of accent incompatibility here , you know . 
TBP : No , let me tell you , I 've told you what my age was . 
I got out of school in ' 51 . 
I witnessed my first frack job at border Texas in 1953 . 
Fracking came out in ' 47 , and do n't believe for a minute when our president gets up there and says the Department of Energy 30 years ago developed fracking . 
I do n't know what in the hell he 's talking about . 
I mean seriously , the Department of Energy did not have anything to do with fracking . 
The first frack job was in ' 47 . 
I saw my first one in ' 53 . 
I 've fracked over 3,000 wells in my life . 
Never had a problem with messing up an aquifer or anything else . 
Now the largest aquifer in North America is from Midland , Texas to the South Dakota border , across eight states -- big aquifer : Ogallala , Triassic age . 
There had to have been 800,000 wells fracked in Oklahoma , Texas , Kansas in that aquifer . 
There 's no problems . 
I do n't understand why the media is focused on Eastern Pennsylvania . 
CA : All right , so you do n't support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon . 
Your picture then I guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately , that we 'll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive ? 
TBP : Solar and wind , Jim and I agreed on that in 13 seconds . 
That is , it 's going to be a small part , because you ca n't rely on it . 
CA : So how does the world get off fossil fuels ? 
TBP : How do we get there ? 
We have so much natural gas , a day will not come where you say , " Well let 's do n't use that anymore . " 
You 'll keep using it . It is the cleanest of all . 
And if you look at California , they use 2,500 buses . 
LAMTA have been on natural gas for 25 years . 
The Ft . Worth T has been on it for 25 years . 
Why ? Air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from diesel . 
Why are all the trash trucks today in Southern California on natural gas ? 
It 's because of air quality . 
I know what you 're telling me , and I 'm not disagreeing with you . 
How in the hell can we get off the natural gas at some point ? 
And I say , that is your problem . 
CA : All right , so it 's the bridge fuel . 
What is at the other end of that bridge is for this audience to figure out . 
If someone comes to you with a plan that really looks like it might be part of this solution , are you ready to invest in those technologies , even if they are n't maximized for profits , they might be maximized for the future health of the planet ? 
TBP : I lost 150 million on the wind , okay . 
Yeah , sure , I 'm game for it . 
Because , again , I 'm trying to get energy solved for America . 
And anything American will work for me . 
CA : Boone , I really , really appreciate you coming here , engaging in this conversation . 
I think there 's a lot of people who will want to engage with you . 
And that was a real gift you gave this audience . 
Thank you so much .

The dot - com boom and bust is often compared to the Gold Rush . But Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos says it ’s more like the early days of the electric industry .

Jeff Bezos on the next web innovation 
When you think about resilience and technology it 's actually much easier . 
You 're going to see some other speakers today , I already know , who are going to talk about breaking - bones stuff , and , of course , with technology it never is . 
So it 's very easy , comparatively speaking , to be resilient . 
I think that , if we look at what happened on the Internet , with such an incredible last half a dozen years , that it 's hard to even get the right analogy for it . 
A lot of how we decide , how we 're supposed to react to things and what we 're supposed to expect about the future depends on how we bucket things and how we categorize them . 
And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom - bust that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush . 
It 's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick . 
For one thing , both were very real . 
In 1849 , in that Gold Rush , they took over $ 700 million worth of gold out of California . It was very real . 
The Internet was also very real . This is a real way for humans to communicate with each other . It 's a big deal . 
Huge boom . Huge boom . Huge bust . Huge bust . 
You keep going , and both things are lots of hype . 
I do n't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the Internet -- like GetRich.com . 
But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush . " Gold . Gold . Gold . " 
Sixty - eight rich men on the Steamer Portland . Stacks of yellow metal . 
Some have 5,000 . Many have more . 
A few bring out 100,000 dollars each . 
People would get very excited about this when they read these articles . 
" The Eldorado of the United States of America : the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California . " 
And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly . 
So many people left what they were doing . 
And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years . 
People on the East Coast in 1849 , when they first started to get the news , they thought , " Ah , this is n't real . " 
But they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 1850 they still hear that . And they think it 's not real . 
By about 1852 , they 're thinking , " Am I the stupidest person on Earth by not rushing to California ? " And they start to decide they are . 
These are community affairs , by the way . 
Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams of 10 , 20 people would caravan across the United States , and they would form companies . 
These were typically not solitary efforts . But no matter what , if you were a lawyer or a banker , people dropped what they were doing , no matter what skill set they had , to go pan for gold . 
This guy on the left , Dr. Richard Beverley Cole , he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route . 
They would take a ship down to Panama , across the isthmus , and then take another ship north . 
This guy , Dr. Toland , went by covered wagon to California . 
This has its parallels , too . Doctors leaving their practices . 
These are both very successful -- a physician in one case , a surgeon in the other . 
Same thing happened on the Internet . You get DrKoop.com . 
In the Gold Rush , people literally jumped ship . 
The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold . 
So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships . 
They turned the ships into hotels , because they could n't sail them anywhere . 
You had dotcom fever . And you had gold fever . 
And you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened . 
The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers . 
Half of them deserted to go look for gold . 
And they would n't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they would n't come back . 
And one of the soldiers wrote home , and this is the sentence that he put : " The struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one . " 
They had bad burn rate in the Gold Rush . A very bad burn rate . 
This is actually from the Klondike Gold Rush . This is the White Pass Trail . 
They loaded up their mules and their horses . 
And they did n't plan right . 
And they did n't know how far they would really have to go , and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff . 
In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going . 
It got renamed the " Dead Horse Trail . " 
And the Canadian Minister of the Interior wrote this at the time : " Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way , sometimes in bunches under the cliffs , with pack saddles and packs where they 've fallen from the rock above , sometimes in tangled masses , filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march , often , I regret to say , exhausted , but still alive , a fact we were unaware of , until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade . 
The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road . 
The inhumanity which this trail has been witness to , the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone , can not be imagined . They certainly can not be described . " 
And you know , without the smell that would have accompanied that , we had the same thing on the Internet : very bad burn rate calculations . 
I 'll just play one of these and you 'll remember it . 
This is a commercial that was played on the Super Bowl in the year 2000 . 
: Bride # 1 : You said you had a large selection of invitations . Clerk : But we do . 
Bride # 2 : Then why does she have my invitation ? 
Announcer : What may be a little thing to some ... Bride # 3 : You are mine , little man . 
Announcer : Could be a really big deal to you . Husband # 1 : Is that your wife ? 
Husband # 2 : Not for another 15 minutes . Announcer : After all , it 's your special day . 
OurBeginning.com . Life 's an event . Announce it to the world . 
Jeff Bezos : It 's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for . 
But they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad , even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in annual revenue . 
Now , here 's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge , and I think rather severely . 
And that is , in a gold rush , when it 's over , it 's over . 
Here 's this guy : " There are many men in Dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed . 
They 've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip , risked life , health and property , spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them . " 
And that was , of course , the very common story . 
Because when you take out that last piece of gold -- and they did incredibly quickly . I mean , if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush -- the entire American river region , within two years -- every stone had been turned . And after that , only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there . 
So there 's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry . 
And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry . 
With the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they 're both sort of thin , horizontal , enabling layers that go across lots of different industries . 
It 's not a specific thing . 
But electricity is also very , very broad , so you have to sort of narrow it down . 
You know , it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power . 
It 's an incredible means of coordinating , in a very fine - grained way , information flows . 
There 's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity . 
And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances . 
The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb . 
So the light bulb is what wired the world . 
And they were n't thinking about appliances when they wired the world . 
They were really thinking about -- they were n't putting electricity into the home ; they were putting lighting into the home . 
And , but it really -- it got the electricity . It took a long time . 
This was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out . 
All the streets had to be torn up . 
This is work going on down in lower Manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations . 
And they 're tearing up all the streets . 
The Edison Electric Company , which became Edison General Electric , which became General Electric , paid for all of this digging up of the streets . It was incredibly expensive . 
But that is not the -- and that 's not the part that 's really most similar to the Web . 
Because , remember , the Web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long - distance phone network . 
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- I 'm going back now to , sort of , the explosive part of the Web in 1994 , when it was growing 2,300 percent a year . 
How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994 when people were n't really investing in the Web ? 
Well , it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down . 
So the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure , and then home appliances started coming into being . 
And this was huge . The first one was the electric fan -- this was the 1890 electric fan . 
And the appliances , the golden age of appliances really lasted -- it depends how you want to measure it -- but it 's anywhere from 40 to 60 years . It goes on a long time . 
It starts about 1890 . And the electric fan was a big success . 
The electric iron , also very big . 
By the way , this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit . 
There 's asbestos under that handle there . 
This is the first vacuum cleaner , the 1905 Skinner Vacuum , from the Hoover Company . And this one weighed 92 pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car . 
So it was n't a big seller . 
This was truly , truly an early - adopter product -- the 1905 Skinner Vacuum . 
But three years later , by 1908 , it weighed 40 pounds . 
Now , not all these things were highly successful . 
This is the electric tie press , which never really did catch on . 
People , I guess , decided that they would not wrinkle their ties . 
These never really caught on either : the electric shoe warmer and drier . Never a big seller . 
This came in , like , six different colors . 
I do n't know why . But I thought , you know , sometimes it 's just not the right time for an invention ; maybe it 's time to give this one another shot . 
So I thought we could build a Super Bowl ad for this . 
We 'd need the right partner . And I thought that really -- I thought that would really work , to give that another shot . 
Now , the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires , and it took a lot of time and attention . 
I want to point out one thing . This is -- you guys know what this is . 
They had n't invented the electric socket yet . 
So this was -- remember , they did n't wire the houses for electricity . 
They wired them for lighting . So your -- your appliances would plug in . 
They would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top . 
And you 'd plug it in there . 
In fact , if you 've seen the Carousel of Progress at Disney World , you 've seen this . Here are the cables coming up into this light fixture . 
All the appliances plug in there . And you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance . 
The next thing that really was a big , big deal was the washing machine . 
Now , this was an object of much envy and lust . 
Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines . 
On the left - hand side , this was the soapy water . 
And there 's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning . 
And it would clean your clothes . 
This is the clean rinse - water . So you 'd take the clothes out of here , put them in here , and then you 'd run the clothes through this electric ringer . 
And this was a big deal . 
You 'd keep this on your porch . It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain . 
And you 'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket . 
And that 's actually kind of an important point in my presentation , because they had n't invented the off switch . 
That was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances -- because it did n't make any sense . 
I mean , you did n't want this thing clogging up a light socket . 
So you know , when you were done with it , you unscrewed it . 
That 's what you did . You did n't turn it off . 
And as I said before , they had n't invented the electric outlet either , so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device . 
And there are -- when you research this , there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices . 
And they could n't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house . 
And there was no off switch , so it was n't very good . 
And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this . 
But , you know , before I get too far into condemning our ancestors , I thought I 'd show you : this is my conference room . 
This is a total kludge , if you ask me . 
First of all , this got installed upside down . This light socket -- and so the cord keeps falling out , so I taped it in . 
This is supposed -- do n't even get me started . But that 's not the worst one . 
This is what it looks like under my desk . 
I took this picture just two days ago . 
So we really have n't progressed that much since 1908 . 
It 's a total , total mess . 
And , you know , we think it 's getting better , but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself ? 
I challenge you to try . It 's very hard . 
I know Ph . D.s in Computer Science -- this process has brought them to tears , absolute tears . 
And that 's assuming you already have DSL in your house . 
Try to get DSL installed in your house . 
The engineers who do it everyday ca n't do it . 
They have to -- typically , they come three times . 
And one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody . 
And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there . 
So we 're not -- we 're pretty kludge - y ourselves . 
By the way , DSL is a kludge . 
I mean , this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it 's being put to -- you know it 's the whole thing -- we 're very , very primitive . And that 's kind of the point . 
Because , you know , resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush , then you 'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone . 
But the good thing is , with innovation , there is n't a last nugget . 
Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities . 
And if you believe that , then you believe that where we are -- this is what I think -- I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge -- and I have n't even talked about user interfaces on the Web -- but there 's so much kludge , so much terrible stuff -- we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet . 
That 's where we are . We do n't get our hair caught in it , but that 's the level of primitiveness of where we are . 
We 're in 1908 . 
And if you believe that , then stuff like this does n't bother you . This is 1996 : " All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble . " 
1998 : " Amazon.toast . " In 1999 : " Amazon.bomb . " 
My mom hates this picture . 
She -- but you know , if you really do believe that it 's the very , very beginning , if you believe it 's the 1908 Hurley washing machine , then you 're incredibly optimistic . And I do think that that 's where we are . 
And I do think there 's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us . 
And in 1917 , Sears -- I want to get this exactly right . 
This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917 . 
It says : " Use your electricity for more than light . " 
And I think that 's where we are . 
We 're very , very early . Thank you very much .

Robert Wright uses evolutionary biology and game theory to explain why we appreciate the Golden Rule , why we sometimes ignore it and why there ’s hope that , in the near future , we might all have the compassion to follow it .

Robert Wright : The evolution of compassion 
I 'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective . 
I 'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule . 
So , I 'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language , and so it 's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk . 
I want to warn you about that . 
So , I do want to say , at the outset , that I think compassion 's great . 
The golden rule is great . I 'm a big supporter of both . 
And I think it 's great that the leaders of the religions of the world are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles that are integral to their faiths . 
At the same time , I think religions do n't deserve all the credit . 
I think nature gave them a helping hand here . 
I 'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule are , in a certain sense , built into human nature . 
But I 'm also going to argue that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature , you realize that just affirming compassion , and affirming the golden rule , is really not enough . 
There 's a lot of work to be done after that . 
OK so , a quick natural history , first of compassion . 
In the beginning , there was compassion , and I mean not just when human beings first showed up , but actually even before that . 
I think it 's probably the case that , in the human evolutionary lineage , even before there were homo sapiens , feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way into the gene pool , and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened . 
It happened through a principle known as kin selection . 
And the basic idea of kin selection is that , if an animal feels compassion for a close relative , and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative , then , in the end , the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself . 
So , from a biologist 's point of view , compassion is actually a gene 's way of helping itself . OK . 
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy . 
I 'll get there -- I hope to get a little fuzzier . 
This does n't bother me so much , that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion is kind of self - serving at the genetic level . 
Actually , I think the bad news about kin selection is just that it means that this kind of compassion is naturally deployed only within the family . 
That 's the bad news . The good news is compassion is natural . 
The bad news is that this kin selected compassion is naturally confined to the family . 
Now , there 's more good news that came along later in evolution , a second kind of evolutionary logic . 
Biologists call that " reciprocal altruism . " OK . 
And there , the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor . 
Again , I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past , but from a biologist 's point of view , this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self - serving too . 
It 's not that people think that , when they feel the compassion . 
It 's not consciously self - serving , but to a biologist , that 's the logic . 
And so , you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies . 
I 'm sure a lot of you , if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them , you feel really bad . 
But if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you 've never heard of , you can probably live with that . 
That 's just human nature . 
So , it 's another good news / bad news story . 
It 's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic . 
The bad news is this does n't bring us universal compassion by itself . 
So , there 's still work to be done . 
Now , there 's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism , which I think is kind of good news , which is that the way that this is played out in the human species , it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule . 
I do n't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions , no exposure to ethical philosophy , and you 'll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deserves another , and that bad deeds should be punished . 
And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes . 
So , they do understand that if you want to be treated well , you treat other people well . 
And it 's good to treat other people well . 
That 's close to being a kind of built - in intuition . 
So , that 's good news . Now , if you 've been paying attention , you 're probably anticipating that there 's bad news here ; we still are n't to universal love , and it 's true because , although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural , it 's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule . 
I mean , for example , none of us , probably , want to go to prison , but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison . Right ? 
So , we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated . 
Now , we have a rationale for that . 
We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison . 
None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion . 
We have the capacity to carve out exceptions , put people in a special category . 
And the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison , you have this impartial judiciary determining who gets excluded from the golden rule -- that in everyday life , the way we all make these decisions about who we 're not going to extend the golden rule to , is we use a much rougher and readier formula . 
Basically it 's just like , if you 're my enemy , if you 're my rival -- if you 're not my friend , if you 're not in my family -- I 'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you . 
We all do that , and you see it all over the world . 
You see it in the Middle East : people who , from Gaza , are firing missiles at Israel . 
They would n't want to have missiles fired at them , but they say , " Well , but the Israelis , or some of them have done things that put them in a special category . " 
The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them , but they impose one on Gaza , and they say , " Well , the Palestinians , or some of them , have brought this on themselves . " 
So , it 's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world 's trouble . 
And it 's natural to do that . 
So , the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us is not , by itself , going to bring us universal love . 
It 's not going to save the world . 
Now , there 's one piece of good news I have that may save the world . Okay . 
Are you on the edges of your seats here ? 
Good , because before I tell you about that good news , I 'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain . 
So , I hope I 've got your attention with this promise of good news that may save the world . 
It 's this non - zero - sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about . 
It 's just a quick introduction to game theory . 
This wo n't hurt . Okay . 
It 's about zero - sum and non - zero - sum games . 
If you ask what kind of a situation is conducive to people becoming friends and allies , the technical answer is a non - zero - sum situation . 
And if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies , it 's a zero - sum situation . 
So , what do those terms mean ? 
Basically , a zero - sum game is the kind you 're used to in sports , where there 's a winner and a loser . 
So , their fortunes add up to zero . 
So , in tennis , every point is either good for you and bad for the other person , or good for them , bad for you . 
Either way , your fortunes add up to zero . That 's a zero - sum game . 
Now , if you 're playing doubles , then the person on your side of the net is in a non - zero - sum relationship with you , because every point is either good for both of you -- positive , win - win -- or bad for both of you , it 's lose - lose . 
That 's a non - zero - sum game . 
And in real life , there are lots of non - zero - sum games . 
In the realm of economics , say , if you buy something : that means you 'd rather have the merchandise than the money , but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise . 
You both feel you 've won . 
In a war , two allies are playing a non - zero - sum game . 
It 's going to either be win - win or lose - lose for them . 
So , there are lots of non - zero - sum games in real life . 
And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier , about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed , by just saying , well , compassion most naturally flows along non - zero - sum channels where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win - win situation with some of their friends or allies . 
The deployment of the golden rule most naturally happens along these non - zero - sum channels . 
So , kind of webs of non - zero - sumness are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule to kind of work their magic . 
With zero - sum channels you would expect something else . 
Okay . So , now you 're ready for the good news that I said might save the world . 
And now I can admit that it might not too , now that I 've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff . 
But it may . And the good news is that history has naturally expanded these webs of non - zero - sumness , these webs that can be these channels for compassion . 
You can go back all the way to the stone age : technological evolution -- roads , the wheel , writing , a lot of transportation and communication technologies -- has just inexorably made it so that more people can be in more non - zero - sum relationships with more and more people at greater and greater distances . 
That 's the story of civilization . 
It 's why social organization has grown from the hunter - gatherer village to the ancient state , the empire , and now here we are in a globalized world . 
And the story of globalization is largely a story of non - zero - sumness . 
You 've probably heard the term " interdependence " applied to the modern world . Well , that 's just another term for non - zero - sum . 
If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody , then you live in a non - zero - sum relationship with them . 
And you see this all the time in the modern world . 
You saw it with the recent economic crash , where bad things happen in the economy -- bad for everybody , for much of the world . 
Good things happen , and it 's good for much of the world . 
And , you know , I 'm happy to say , I think there 's really evidence that this non - zero - sum kind of connection can expand the moral compass . 
I mean , if you look at the American attitudes toward Japanese during World War II -- look at the depictions of Japanese in the American media as just about subhuman , and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs , really without giving it much of a thought -- and you compare that to the attitude now , I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence . 
Any form of interdependence , or non - zero - sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people . 
So , I think that 's good . 
And the world is full of non - zero - sum dynamics . 
Environmental problems , in many ways , put us all in the same boat . 
And there are non - zero - sum relationships that maybe people are n't aware of . 
For example , probably a lot of American Christians do n't think of themselves as being in a non - zero - sum relationship with Muslims halfway around the world , but they really are , because if these Muslims become happier and happier with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it , that 's good for Americans , because there will be fewer terrorists to threaten American security . 
If they get less and less happy , that will be bad for Americans . 
So , there 's plenty of non - zero - sumness . 
And so , the question is : If there 's so much non - zero - sumness , why has the world not yet been suffused in love , peace , and understanding ? 
The answer 's complicated . It 's the occasion for a whole other talk . 
Certainly , a couple of things are that , first of all , there are a lot of zero - sum situations in the world . 
And also , sometimes people do n't recognize the non - zero - sum dynamics in the world . 
In both of these areas , I think politicians can play a role . 
This is n't only about religion . 
I think politicians can help foster non - zero - sum relationships , Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on , in this regard . 
And politicians can be aware , and should be aware that , when people around the world are looking at them , are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a zero - sum or a non - zero - sum relationship with a nation -- like , say , America , or any other nation -- human psychology is such that they use cues like : Do we feel we 're being respected ? 
Because , you know , historically , if you 're not being respected , you 're probably not going to wind up in a non - zero - sum , mutually profitable relationship with people . 
So , we need to be aware of what kind of signals we 're sending out . 
And some of this , again , is in the realm of political work . 
If there 's one thing I can encourage everyone to do , politicians , religious leaders , and us , it would be what I call " expanding the moral imagination " -- that is to say , your ability to put yourself in the shoes of people in very different circumstances . 
This is not the same as compassion , but it 's conducive to compassion . It opens the channels for compassion . 
And I 'm afraid we have another good news / bad news story , which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature . 
That 's good , but again we tend to deploy it selectively . 
Once we define somebody as an enemy , we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes , just naturally . 
So , if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American : somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag , and you see them on TV . 
Well , the average American is going to resist the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person 's head and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person . 
And if you tell them , " Well , they think America disrespects them and even wants to dominate them , and they hate America . 
Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much that you kind of hated them briefly " ? 
You know , they 'll resist that comparison and that 's natural , that 's human . 
And , similarly , the person in Iran : when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil , they 'll have trouble with that . 
So , it 's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination to a place it does n't naturally go . 
I think it 's worth the trouble because , again , it just helps us to understand . 
If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags , it helps to understand what makes them do it . 
And I think it 's good moral exercise . 
I would say here is where religious leaders come in , because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people , at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think . 
I mean , religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business . 
It 's their great calling right now , to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations , appreciating that in so many ways they 're in the same boat . 
I would just sum up the way things look , at least from this secular perspective , as far as compassion and the golden rule go , by saying that it 's good news that compassion and the golden rule are in some sense built into human nature . 
It 's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed . 
And it 's going to take real work to change that . 
But , nobody ever said that doing God 's work was going to be easy . Thanks .

Most people instinctively avoid conflict , but as Margaret Heffernan shows us , good disagreement is central to progress . She illustrates how the best partners are n’t echo chambers -- and how great research teams , relationships and businesses allow people to deeply disagree .

Margaret Heffernan : Dare to disagree 
In Oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named Alice Stewart . 
And Alice was unusual partly because , of course , she was a woman , which was pretty rare in the 1950s . 
And she was brilliant , she was one of the , at the time , the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians . 
She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married , after she had kids , and even after she got divorced and was a single parent , she continued her medical work . 
And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science , the emerging field of epidemiology , the study of patterns in disease . 
But like every scientist , she appreciated that to make her mark , what she needed to do was find a hard problem and solve it . 
The hard problem that Alice chose was the rising incidence of childhood cancers . 
Most disease is correlated with poverty , but in the case of childhood cancers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from affluent families . 
So , what , she wanted to know , could explain this anomaly ? 
Now , Alice had trouble getting funding for her research . 
In the end , she got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady Tata Memorial prize . 
And that meant she knew she only had one shot at collecting her data . 
Now , she had no idea what to look for . 
This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search , so she asked everything she could think of . 
Had the children eaten boiled sweets ? 
Had they consumed colored drinks ? 
Did they eat fish and chips ? 
Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing ? 
What time of life had they started school ? 
And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of . 
By a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been X - rayed when pregnant . 
Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom . 
Conventional wisdom held that everything was safe up to a point , a threshold . 
It flew in the face of conventional wisdom , which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology of that age , which was the X - ray machine . 
And it flew in the face of doctors ' idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they did n't harm them . 
Nevertheless , Alice Stewart rushed to publish her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956 . 
People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize , and Alice really was in a big hurry to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find before they disappeared . 
In fact , she need not have hurried . 
It was fully 25 years before the British and medical -- British and American medical establishments abandoned the practice of X - raying pregnant women . 
The data was out there , it was open , it was freely available , but nobody wanted to know . 
A child a week was dying , but nothing changed . 
Openness alone ca n't drive change . 
So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands . 
So , how did she know that she was right ? 
Well , she had a fantastic model for thinking . 
She worked with a statistician named George Kneale , and George was pretty much everything that Alice was n't . 
So , Alice was very outgoing and sociable , and George was a recluse . 
Alice was very warm , very empathetic with her patients . 
George frankly preferred numbers to people . 
But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship . 
He said , " My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong . " 
He actively sought disconfirmation . 
Different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her . 
He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories . 
Because it was only by not being able to prove that she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she needed to know that she was right . 
It 's a fantastic model of collaboration -- thinking partners who are n't echo chambers . 
I wonder how many of us have , or dare to have , such collaborators . 
Alice and George were very good at conflict . 
They saw it as thinking . 
So what does that kind of constructive conflict require ? 
Well , first of all , it requires that we find people who are very different from ourselves . 
That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them . 
That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy . 
And the more I 've thought about this , the more I think , really , that that 's a kind of love . 
Because you simply wo n't commit that kind of energy and time if you do n't really care . 
And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds . 
Alice 's daughter told me that every time Alice went head - to - head with a fellow scientist , they made her think and think and think again . 
" My mother , " she said , " My mother did n't enjoy a fight , but she was really good at them . " 
So it 's one thing to do that in a one - to - one relationship . 
But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face , many of the biggest disasters that we 've experienced , mostly have n't come from individuals , they 've come from organizations , some of them bigger than countries , many of them capable of affecting hundreds , thousands , even millions of lives . 
So how do organizations think ? 
Well , for the most part , they do n't . 
And that is n't because they do n't want to , it 's really because they ca n't . 
And they ca n't because the people inside of them are too afraid of conflict . 
In surveys of European and American executives , fully 85 percent of them acknowledged that they had issues or concerns at work that they were afraid to raise . 
Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose . 
Eighty - five percent is a really big number . 
It means that organizations mostly ca n't do what George and Alice so triumphantly did . 
They ca n't think together . 
And it means that people like many of us , who have run organizations , and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can , mostly fail to get the best out of them . 
So how do we develop the skills that we need ? 
Because it does take skill and practice , too . 
If we are n't going to be afraid of conflict , we have to see it as thinking , and then we have to get really good at it . 
So , recently , I worked with an executive named Joe , and Joe worked for a medical device company . 
And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on . 
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that its complexity created margins of error that could really hurt people . 
He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help . 
But when he looked around his organization , nobody else seemed to be at all worried . 
So , he did n't really want to say anything . 
After all , maybe they knew something he did n't . 
Maybe he 'd look stupid . 
But he kept worrying about it , and he worried about it so much that he got to the point where he thought the only thing he could do was leave a job he loved . 
In the end , Joe and I found a way for him to raise his concerns . 
And what happened then is what almost always happens in this situation . 
It turned out everybody had exactly the same questions and doubts . 
So now Joe had allies . They could think together . 
And yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate and argument , but that allowed everyone around the table to be creative , to solve the problem , and to change the device . 
Joe was what a lot of people might think of as a whistle - blower , except that like almost all whistle - blowers , he was n't a crank at all , he was passionately devoted to the organization and the higher purposes that that organization served . 
But he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the silence . 
And when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined . 
And his colleagues do n't think of him as a crank . 
They think of him as a leader . 
So , how do we have these conversations more easily and more often ? 
Well , the University of Delft requires that its PhD students have to submit five statements that they 're prepared to defend . 
It does n't really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority . 
I think it 's a fantastic system , but I think leaving it to PhD candidates is far too few people , and way too late in life . 
I think we need to be teaching these skills to kids and adults at every stage of their development , if we want to have thinking organizations and a thinking society . 
The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we 've witnessed rarely come from information that is secret or hidden . 
It comes from information that is freely available and out there , but that we are willfully blind to , because we ca n't handle , do n't want to handle , the conflict that it provokes . 
But when we dare to break that silence , or when we dare to see , and we create conflict , we enable ourselves and the people around us to do our very best thinking . 
Open information is fantastic , open networks are essential . 
But the truth wo n't set us free until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent and the moral courage to use it . 
Openness is n't the end . 
It 's the beginning .

Stewart Brand works on the Clock of the Long Now , a timepiece that counts down the next 10,000 years . It 's a beautiful project that asks us to think about the far , far future . Here , he discusses a tricky side problem with the Clock : Where can we put it ?

Stewart Brand on the Long Now 
Welcome to 10,000 feet . 
Let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you . 
Once upon a time , I did a book called " How Buildings Learn . " 
Today 's event you might call " How Mountains Teach . " 
A little background : For 10 years I 've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long - term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare -- or in some cases , non - existent . 
It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter , but you know , next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years -- basically civilization 's story so far . 
So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco . 
It 's an incubator for about a dozen projects , all having to do with continuity over the long term . 
Our core project is a rather ambitious folly -- I suppose , a mythic undertaking : to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period . 
And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious . 
Go to the clock . And what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago . 
It 's the first working prototype of the clock . 
It 's about nine feet high . 
Designed by Danny Hillis and Alexander Rose . It 's presently in London , and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there . 
So the design problem for today is going to be , how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick , save time beautifully for 100 centuries ? 
Well , this was the first solution . 
Alexander Rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps . 
And it looked like a way to go , until you start thinking about , what does deep time do to a building ? 
Well , this is what deep time does to a building . 
This is the Parthenon . It 's only 2,450 years old , and look what happened to it . 
Here 's a beautiful project . They really knew it 'd last forever , because they 'd build it out of absolutely huge stones . 
And now it 's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for . 
That 's what happens to buildings . They 're vulnerable . 
Even the most durable and intactable buildings , like the pyramids of Giza , are in bad shape when you look up close . 
They 've been looted inside and out . 
And they 're built to protect things but they do n't protect things . 
So we got to thinking , if you ca n't put things safely in a building , where can you safely put them ? We thought , OK , underground . 
How about underground with a view ? 
Underground in a place that 's really solid . 
So the obvious answer was , we need a mountain . 
You do n't want just any mountain . 
You need absolutely the right mountain if you 're going to have a clock for 10,000 years . 
So here 's an image of the long view of the search problem . 
And we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain , so we got looking in the dry areas of the Southwest . 
We looked at mesas in New Mexico . 
We were looking at dead volcanoes in Arizona . 
Then Roger Kennedy , who was the director of the National Parks Service , led us to Eastern Nevada , to America 's newest and oldest national park , which is called Great Basin National Park . 
It 's right on the eastern border of Nevada . 
It 's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet . 
And you 'll notice that on the left , on the left , on the west , it 's very steep , and on the right it 's gentle . 
This place is remote . It 's over 200 miles from any major city . 
It 's nowhere near any Interstate or railroad . 
And it 's -- the only thing that goes by is what 's called America 's loneliest highway , U.S. 50 . 
Now , inside the yellow line here , on the right is -- that 's all national park . 
Inside the green line is national forest . 
And then over to the left is Bureau of Land Management land and some private land . 
Now , as it happened , that two - mile - long strip right in the middle , this vertical , was available because it was private land . 
And thanks to Jay Walker who was here and Mitch Kapor who was here , who started the process , Long Now was able to get that two - mile - long strip of land . 
And now let 's look at the grand truth of what 's there . 
We 're in Pole Canyon , looking west up the western escarpment of Mount Washington , which is 11,600 feet on top . 
Those white cliffs are a dense Cambrian limestone . 
That 's a 2,000-foot thick formation , and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock . 
It would be a pilgrimage to get to it ; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is . 
So last June , the Long Now board , some staff and some donors and advisors , made a two - week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate , one , if it 's the right mountain , and two , if it 's the right mountain , how it might actually work for us . 
Now Danny Hillis sort of framed the problem . 
He has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work . 
It 's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure . 
It starts with the image . The image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey . 
In this case it might well be an image of the clock . 
Then there 's the point of embarkation , that is , the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest . 
Then -- this is a nice image of it , there 's the labyrinth . 
The labyrinth is a concept , it 's like a twilight zone , it 's a place where it 's difficult , where you get disoriented , maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it if you 're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration . 
Then there should always be in sight the draw -- a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there . 
Now Brian Eno , who 's been in the thick of the Long Now process , spent two years making a C.D. called " January 7003 , " and it 's " Bell Studies for the Clock of the Long Now . " 
Based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that Danny Hillis developed , so that a peal of 10 bells makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years . 
The Hillis algorithm . 10 factorial gives you that number . 
And in fact , pretty soon we 'll hear the sound . 
January 7003 . There it is . 
OK , back to Danny 's list . 
Number five of the seven is the payoff . This is it . The climax . 
The goal . The main thing that you 're trying to get to . 
And then Danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff . 
Something you did n't expect that caps what you did expect . 
Then there 's the return . 
You 've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world , so you have time to assimilate what you 've learned . 
And then , how about a memento ? Number seven . 
At the end of it there 's something physical , a kind of reward that you take away . 
It might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain . 
Something that 's just yours . 
How do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we 're talking about ? 
This is not a normal building project . 
What do you look for ? 
What are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions ? 
Start with borders . If you look on the left side of the cliffs here , that 's national park . That 's sacrosanct -- you ca n't do anything with that . To the right of it is national forest . 
There 's possibilities . The borders are important . 
Other elements were mines , weather , approaches and elevation . 
And especially trees . Look at those things up on top there . 
It turns out that Mount Washington is covered with bristlecone pines . 
They 're the world 's oldest living thing . 
People think they 're just the size of shrubs , but that 's not actually true . 
There are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living . 
The wood is so solid it 's like stone , and it lasts for a long time . 
So when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain , some of them go back 10,000 years . 
The stone itself is absolutely beautiful , sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there . 
We had tree ring analysts from the University of Arizona join us on the expedition . 
Now , if you guys have a pine cone handy , now 's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it , especially on the end . 
That 's interesting . 
You 'll find out why it 's called a bristlecone pine . A little sensory experience . 
Here 's Danny Hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on Long Now land . I should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered , led by a theory . 
Edmund Schulman in the 1950s had been studying trees under great stress at Timberline , and came to the realization that he put in an article in Science magazine called , " Longevity under Adversity in Conifers . " 
And then , based on that principle , he started looking around at the various trees at Timberline , and realized that the bristlecone pines -- he found some in the White Mountains that were over 4,000 years old . 
Longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right . 
OK , onto the mines . The first asking price for the property when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines . 
Because the owner said , " There 's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain . " 
And we said , " Wow , that 's great . Listen , we 'll counter . How about zero ? 
And we 're a non - profit foundation , you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction . 
All you have to do is prove to the government it 's worth a billion dollars . " 
Well , a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth , and by and by , thanks to Mitch and Jay , we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars . 
This is one of the mines . It does n't have any beryllium in it . 
It 's called the Pole Adit . And it does have tungsten , a little bit of tungsten , left over , that 's the kind of mine it was . 
But it goes a mile - and - a - half in a straight line , due east into the range , into very interesting territory -- except that , as you 'll see when we go inside in a minute , we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale . 
And shale is not quite completely competent rock . 
Competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring . 
The shale would like some shoring , and so parts of it are caved in in there . 
That 's Ben Roberts from -- he 's the bat specialist from the National Park . 
But there are many wonders back in there , like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers . 
OK , here 's another mine that 's up on top of the property , and it dates back to 1870 . 
That 's what the property was originally built around -- it was a set of mining claims . It was a very productive silver mine . 
In fact , it was the highest - operating mine in Nevada , and it ran year round . 
You can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet . 
You may recognize a couple of the miners there . 
There 's Jeff Bezos on the right and Paul Saville on the left looking for galena , which is the lead - silver thing . They did n't find any . 
They both kept their day jobs . Here 's the last mine . 
It 's called the Bonanza Adit . It 's down in a canyon . 
And Alexander Rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the National Park to survey the whole mine . It 's a mile deep . 
And they also found four species of bats in there . 
Now , almost all those mines , by the way , meet underneath the mountain . 
They do n't quite , but it 's something to think about . 
They do n't quite meet . 
Let 's go to weather . Mountains specialize in interesting weather . 
Way more interesting than Monterey even today . 
And so one Tuesday morning last June , there we were . 
Woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow . 
That was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again , thanks to Mitch Kapor , we 're building up there . 
And it 's a pretty interesting scene . 
This is , on the left there , the joyful lady is Pat Irwin , who 's the regional head of the National Forest Service , and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there . 
We want a temporary use permit for the clock , eventually -- 10,000-year temporary use permit . 
The weather station 's pretty interesting . 
Kurt Bollacker and Alexander Rose designed a radically wireless station . 
It runs on solar , and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in Bozeman , Montana , where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to San Francisco , where we put the data in real time up on our website . 
And there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on Mount Washington . 
Let 's go to approaches . 
As it happens , there are no trails anywhere on Mount Washington , just a few old mining roads like this , so you have to bushwhack everywhere . 
But there 's no bears , and there 's no poison oak , and there 's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time . 
You can hike for days and not encounter anybody . 
Well , here 's a potential approach . 
You need to come up the Lincoln Canyon . 
It 's this beautiful world all of its own , surrounded by cliffs , and it 's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom , until you get to this barrier , and it actually presents a problem . 
So you can scratch Lincoln Canyon as an approach . 
Another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain . 
You can see why we sometimes call it Long Mountain . 
And from where you 're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley , it 's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet . 
And you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet , where there 's a bit of a problem . 
Now , Jeff Bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition , " Make the clock inaccessible . 
The harder it is to get to , the more people will value it . " 
And check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there . 
So Alexander Rose wanted to explore this route , and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck at 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain . 
Now , as you gain elevation your IQ goes down -- but your emotional affect goes up , which is great for having a mythic experience , whether you want to or not . 
In fact , Danny Hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he ca n't do in his head . 
Now , I happened to be on the radio with Alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs , and he said , quote , " There 's a hidden notch . I think I can get up a ways . " 
Now , he 's a rock climber , but you know , he 's our executive director . 
I do n't want him killed . I know he 's going to love cliffs . 
I 'm saying , " Be careful , be careful , be careful . " 
Then he starts going up , and the next thing I hear is , " I 'm half - way up . It 's like climbing stairs . I 'm going up 60 degrees . 
It 's a secret passage . It 's like something from Tolkien . " 
And I 'm going , " Careful , careful . Please be careful . " 
And then , of course , the next thing I hear is , " I 've made it to the top . You can see all of creation from up here . " 
And he dashed across the top of the mountains . 
In fact , there he is . That 's Alexander Rose . 
First ascent of the western face to Mount Washington , and a solo ascent at that . 
This discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them . 
We realized that we had to name this thing that Alexander discovered . 
How about Zander 's Crevice ? No . 
So we finally decided on Alexander 's Siq . 
Zander 's Siq is named after -- some of you have been to Petra , there 's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into Petra called the Siq , and so this is the Siq . 
And it really is hidden . I ca n't find it in this image , and I 'm not sure you can . 
Only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there , and that brings it out . 
Now , Danny and I were up at this same area one day , and Danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs , which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it , and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view . 
And the people toiling up the mountain could see them , these tiny little people up there , incredibly halfway up the cliff . 
How did they get there ? Do I have to do that ? 
And so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth . 
You can get another angle on Danny 's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there . 
And you need to know that Danny 's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine , that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day , and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate . 
So even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on , the clock will keep perfectly good time . 
So here we 're looking from the south , look north . 
This is all Forest Service land . If you go up on top of those cliffs , that 's some of the Long Now land in those trees . 
And if you go up there and look back , then you 'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain . 
That 's the long view . That 's 80 miles to the horizon . 
And that 's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs . 
That 's a different place to be . It 's 11,400 feet and it 's exquisite . 
Now , if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs , it 's 600 foot , just about a yard to the left of Kurt Bollacker 's foot , there is a 600-foot drop . He 's ambling on over to Zander 's Siq . 
That 's what it looks like looking down it . 
We should probably put in a rail or something . 
Over on the eastern side it 's gentle , as you can see . 
And that 's not snow -- that 's what the white limestone looks like . 
You also see there a bighorn sheep . 
Their herd was reintroduced from Wyoming . 
And they 're doing pretty well , but they 've got a bit of trouble . 
This is Danny Hillis , and he 's figuring out a design problem . 
he 's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of Long Now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain . 
because the real peak is hidden around the corner . 
This is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest . 
And as it turned out the answer is , yes , that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak , and that might be conjured with . 
We gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this . 
One is the experience of the mountain . 
Another is the experience in the mountain . 
And the third is the experience from the mountain , which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind Danny , and if you look off to the right , out there , 15 miles across to the Schell Creek range . 
In the front , there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains . 
In fact , there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air . 
One of the ranches is called the Kirkeby Ranch , and I 'll take you there for a minute . 
It 's a very nice ranch . 
Alfalfa and cattle , run by Paul and Ronnie Brenham , and it 's pretty idyllic . It 's also hard work . 
And most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going . 
This is their view to the west of the Schell Creek range . 
And if you go out to that line of trees at the far end , you 'll see what the valley used to look like . 
This is Rocky Mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years . 
And a scheme emerged that Long Now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley , because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on , and there 's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition , and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the National Park , and it would double the size of Great Basin National Park . That would be swell . 
OK , let 's take one more look at the mountain itself . 
The clock experience should be profound , but from the outside it should be invisible . 
Now , at the base of the high cliffs there 's this natural cave . 
It 's only about 12 feet deep , but what if it were deepened from inside ? 
You excavated from somewhere , came up from inside and deepened it . 
And then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in , that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite . 
And this stone takes a perfect polish . 
You 'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock . 
And it 's not a mine . This would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain , and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside . 
This is architecture not made by building , but by what you very carefully take away . 
So that 's what the mountain taught us . 
Most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain . 
All we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them . 
It 's not a clock in a mountain -- it 's a mountain clock . 
Now , the Tewa Indians in the Southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything . 
They say , " pin peya obe " -- welcome to the mountain . 
Thank you .

Isaac Mizrahi on fashion and creativity 
I have , like , a thing about sleeping . 
I do n't sleep that much , and I 've come to this thing about , like , not sleeping much as being a great virtue , after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment , or something . 
And now I really like sort of sitting up , you know . 
But for years I 've been sitting up and I think that , like , my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia . 
I lie awake . I think thoughts . I walk aimlessly . 
Sometimes I used to walk more at night . 
I walk during the day and I follow people who I think look interesting . 
And sometimes -- actually , once it was on Page Six in the Post , that I was cruising this guy , like , sort of , whatever , but I was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on . 
And so I was following this guy . 
And I took a picture of his shoes , and we thanked each other and just went on our way . 
But I do that all the time . 
As a matter of fact , I think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye . 
Because I feel like , you know , there are so many images out there , so many clothes out there . 
And the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken , of course , or very , very surprising . 
And often , I 'm driving in a taxi and I see a hole in a shirt , or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that I 'd never seen happen before . 
And so I 'd make the car stop , and I 'd get out of the car and walk , and see that in fact there was n't a hole , but it was a trick of my eye , it was a shadow , you know . 
Or if there was a hole I 'd think like , oh damn , there was actually someone thought of that thought already . 
Someone made that mistake already so I ca n't do it anymore . 
I do n't know where inspiration comes from . 
It does not come for me from research . 
I do n't get necessarily inspired by research . 
As a matter of fact , one of the most fun things I 've ever , ever done in my whole life , was this Christmas season at the Guggenheim in New York . 
I read " Peter and the Wolf " with this beautiful band from Juilliard . 
And I did like , you know , the narrator , and I read it . 
And I saw this really smart critic who I love . 
This woman , Joan Acocella , who 's a friend of mine , and she came backstage and she said , oh , you know , Isaac , did you know that , talking about Stalinism and talking about , you know , like the ' 30s in Russia . 
And I said , how do I know about Stalinism ? 
I know about a wolf and a bird and , you know , he ate the bird , and then in the end you hear , you know , you hear the bird squeaking , or something , you know ? 
So I do n't really know that . I do n't really -- actually I do my own kind of research , you know . 
If I 'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th - century opera , or something like that , I will do a lot of research , because it 's interesting , not because it 's what I 'm supposed to do . 
I 'm very , very , very inspired by movies . 
The color of movies and the way light makes the colors , light from behind the projection , or light from the projection , makes the colors look so impossible . 
And anyway , roll this little clip , I 'll just show you . 
I sit up at night and I watch movies and I watch women in movies a lot . 
And I think about , you know , their roles , and about how you have to , like , watch what your daughters look at . 
Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time . 
Whether they 're kind of glorified in this way , or whether they 're kind of , you know , ironically glorified , or whether they 're , you know , sort of denigrated , or ironically denigrated . 
I go back to color all the time . 
Color is something that motivates me a lot . 
It 's rarely color that I find in nature , although , you know , juxtaposed next to artificial color , natural color is so beautiful . 
So that 's what I do . I study color a lot . 
But for the most part , I think , like , how can I ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood ? 
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo ? 
I mean , that 's just not possible , you know . 
And so that 's what makes me lie awake at night , I guess , you know . 
I want to show you -- I 'm also like a big -- I go to astrologers and tarot card readers often , and that 's another thing that motivates me a lot . 
People say , oh , do that . An astrologer tells me to do something . 
So I do it . 
When I was about 21 , an astrologer told me that I was going to meet the man of my dreams , and that his name was going to be Eric , right ? 
So , you know , for years I would go to bars and , sort of , anyone I met whose name was Eric I was humping immediately , or something . 
And there were times when I was actually so desperate I would just , you know , walk into a room and just go like , " Eric ! " 
And anybody who would turn around I would , sort of , make a beeline for . 
And I had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago . 
The last card he pulled , which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know , sort of spats and this , you know , a minstrel singer , right ? 
I want to show you this clip because I do this kind of crazy thing where I do a cabaret act . 
So actually , check this out . 
Very embarrassing . 
: Thank you . We can do anything you ask . 
The name of the show is based on this story that I have to tell you about my mother . 
It 's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers . 
I was dating this guy , right ? 
And this has to do with being happy , I swear . 
I was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year , right . 
And we were getting serious , so we decided to invite them all to dinner , our parents . 
And we , you know , sort of introduced them to each other . 
My mother was , sort of , very sensitive to his mother , who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing . 
You know , homosexuality , right ? 
So my mother was a little offended . She turned to her and she said , " Are you kidding ? They have the greatest life together . 
They eat out , they see shows . " 
They eat out , they see shows . 
That 's the name of the show , they eat out , they -- that 's on my tombstone when I die . 
" He ate out , he saw shows , " right ? 
So in editing these clips , I did n't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at Joe 's Pub . 
So you 'll have to , like , go check it out and come see me or something . 
Because it 's mortifying , and yet it feels ... 
I do n't know how to put this . 
I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing , you know . 
And at least , you know , in my case , because if I just do one thing all the time , I do n't know , I get very , very bored . I bore very easily . 
And you know , I do n't say that I do everything well , I just say that I do a lot of things , that 's all . 
And I kind of try not to look back , you know . 
Except , I guess , that 's what staying up every night is about . 
Like , looking back and thinking , what a fool you made of yourself , you know . 
But I guess that 's okay . Right ? 
Because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything , and not just one , you know . 
You do n't master feeling lousy about one thing . 
Yeah , exactly . 
I will show you this next thing , speaking of costumes for operas . 
I do work with different choreographers . 
I work with Twyla Tharp a lot , and I work with Mark Morris a lot , who is one of my best friends . 
And I designed three operas with him , and the most recent one , " King Arthur . " 
I 'd been very ingrained in the dance world since I was a teenager . 
I went to performing arts high school , where I was an actor . 
And many of my friends were ballet dancers . 
Again , I do n't know where inspiration comes from . 
I do n't know where it comes from . 
I started making puppets when I was a kid . 
Maybe that 's where the whole inspiration thing started from , puppets , right . 
And then performing arts high school . 
There I was in high school , meeting dancers and acting . 
And somehow , from there , I got interested in design . 
I went to Parsons School of Design and then I began my career as a designer . 
I do n't really think of myself as a designer , I do n't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer . 
And frankly , I do n't really know what to call myself . 
I think of myself as a ... I do n't know what I think of myself as . 
It 's just that . 
But I must say , this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time , that is what -- I think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer . 
You always have to be slightly bored with everything . 
And if you 're not , you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything . 
But I am really a little bored with everything . 
I always say to my partner , Marisa Gardini , who books everything -- she books everything and she makes everything happen . 
And she makes all the deals . 
And I always tell her that I find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program . 
Too much time on computer bridge , which is , you know , like that 's so ... somehow , like , about ten years ago I thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a T.V. studio , like for a day show . Some kind of day talk show . 
Because it 's all of these things that I love all kind of in one place . 
And if you ever get bored you can look at another thing , and do another thing and talk about it , right ? 
And so I had this T.V. show . 
And that was a very , very , very big part of my process . 
Actually , could you roll the clip , please ? 
This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie . 
Isaac Mizrahi : We 're back on the set . 
Hi there . 
Rosie O'Donnell : Hello , Ben . 
IM : Look how cute she looks with this , just a slick back . 
Man : Her grandmother says , " Delish ! " 
IM : Ah , wow , delish . All right . So now where should I position myself ? 
I want to stay out of the way . 
I do n't want to be -- okay . Here we go . 
Do you get nervous , Ashleigh ? 
Ashleigh : Doing what ? 
ROD : Cutting hair . 
A : Cutting hair ? Never , never . 
I do n't think there was ever a day where I cut hair I was nervous . 
IM : You look so cute already , by the way . 
ROD : You like it ? All right . 
IM : Do you have a problem with looking cute ? You want to look cute . 
ROD : Of course I want to look cute . 
IM : Just checking , because some people want to look , you know , aggressively ugly . 
ROD : No , not me , no . 
IM : You read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow , like , really messed up , you know what I mean ? 
And there 's got to be some way to do that , Rosie . 
Because just because if you 're fabulously rich , and fabulously famous , does that mean you should n't have kids , because you know they 're going to end up getting messed up ? 
ROD : No , but it means that your priority has to be their well - being first , I think . 
But you have to make the decision for yourself . 
My kids are seven , who the hell knows . 
They 're going to be like 14 and in rehab . 
And they 're going to be playing this clip : " I 'm such a good mother . " 
My God , this is the shortest I 've ever had . 
IM : It looks good , yeah ? 
A : I was going to ask you , has your hair ever been -- ROD : No ! It 's all right -- go crazy . 
IM : I feel like it needs to be a little closer down here . 
A : Oh no , we 're just staging , ROD : We 're just staging it . 
IM : Are you freaking out ? You look so cute . 
ROD : No , I love it . It 's the new me . 
IM : Oh , it 's so fabulous ! 
ROD : Flock of Rosie . Wooo ! 
IM : So by the way . Of all the most unboring things in the world , right . 
I mean , like making someone who 's already cute look terrible like that . 
That is not boring . That is nothing if it 's not boring . 
Actually , I read this great quote the other day , which was , " Style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you 're going to die . " 
Right ? And then I realized , that was on my website , and then it said , like , you know , the quote was attributed to me and I thought , oh , I said something , you know , in an interview . 
I forgot that I said that . But it 's really true . 
I want to show you this last clip because it 's going to be my last goodbye . 
I 'll tell you that I cook a lot also . I love to cook . 
And I often look at things as though they 're food . 
Like I say , oh , you know , would you serve a rotten chicken ? 
Then how could you serve , you know , a beat up old dress or something . 
How could you show a beat up old dress ? 
I always relate things to kitchen - ry . 
And so I think that 's what it all boils down to . 
Everything boils down to that . 
So check this out . 
This is what I 've been doing because I think it 's the most fun thing in the world . 
It 's , like , this website . 
It 's got a lot of different things on it . 
It 's a polymathematical website . 
We actually shoot segments like T.V. show segments . 
And it 's kind of my favorite thing in the world . 
And it just began like in the beginning of February . So who knows ? 
And again , I do n't say it 's good , I just think it 's not boring , right ? 
And here is the last bit . 
IM : I have to tell you , I make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time . 
Chef : Do you ? 
IM : Yeah , but I can never find buttermilk , ever . 
Chef : Oh . 
IM : You ca n't find buttermilk at Citarella ; you ca n't find buttermilk . 
Chef : You ca n't ? 
IM : It 's always low - fat buttermilk . 
Chef : No , but that 's all it is . 
IM : Is that all it is ? 
Chef : Oh , you do n't know ? Let me tell you something . 
Let me tell you something interesting . 
IM : You know what ? Stop laughing . It 's not funny . 
Just because I do n't know that whole -- that there 's no such thing as whole buttermilk . 
Sorry , what ? 
Chef : Well , here 's the deal . Let me tell you the deal . 
In the old days when they used to make butter , you know how you make butter ? 
IM : Churns ? 
Chef : For cream ? 
IM : Yeah , exactly . 
Chef : So you take heavy , high - fat milk , which is cream , and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water . 
The liquid is actually that clear liquid . 
If you 've ever overbeaten your whipped cream , it 's actually buttermilk . 
And that 's what it was in the early days . 
And that 's what people used for baking and all sorts of things . 
Now , the buttermilk that you get is actually low - fat or skim milk . 
IM : Excuse me , I did n't know . All right ? 
Chef : The reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious . 
IM : Yeah , it is , exactly . 
So who would think that it was low - fat ? 
Well , that 's it . Thank you very much . 
Happy TED . It 's so wonderful here . I love it . I love it . I love it . 
Thanks . Bye .

Why do transnational extremist organizations succeed where democratic movements have a harder time taking hold ? Maajid Nawaz , a former Islamist extremist , asks for new grassroots stories and global social activism to spread democracy in the face of nationalism and xenophobia .

Maajid Nawaz : A global culture to fight extremism 
Have you ever wondered why extremism seems to have been on the rise in Muslim - majority countries over the course of the last decade ? 
Have you ever wondered how such a situation can be turned around ? 
Have you ever looked at the Arab uprisings and thought , " How could we have predicted that ? " 
or " How could we have better prepared for that ? " 
Well my personal story , my personal journey , what brings me to the TED stage here today , is a demonstration of exactly what 's been happening in Muslim - majority countries over the course of the last decades , at least , and beyond . 
I want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in Muslim - majority societies . 
So let me begin by first of all giving a very , very brief history of time , if I may indulge . 
In medieval societies there were defined allegiances . 
An identity was defined primarily by religion . 
And then we moved on into an era in the 19th century with the rise of a European nation - state where identities and allegiances were defined by ethnicity . 
So identity was primarily defined by ethnicity , and the nation - state reflected that . 
In the age of globalization , we moved on . 
I call it the era of citizenship -- where people could be from multi - racial , multi - ethnic backgrounds , but all be equal as citizens in a state . 
You could be American - Italian ; you could be American - Irish ; you could be British - Pakistani . 
But I believe now that we 're moving into a new age , and that age The New York Times dubbed recently as " the age of behavior . " 
How I define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances , where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives . 
And these ideas and narratives that bump people across borders are increasingly beginning to affect the way in which people behave . 
Now this is not all necessarily good news , because it 's also my belief that hatred has gone global just as much as love . 
But actually it 's my belief that the people who 've been truly capitalizing on this age of behavior , up until now , up until recent times , up until the last six months , the people who have been capitalizing most on the age of behavior and the transnational allegiances , using digital activism and other sorts of borderless technologies , those who 've been benefiting from this have been extremists . 
And that 's something which I 'd like to elaborate on . 
If we look at Islamists , if we look at the phenomenon of far - right fascists , one thing they 've been very good at , one thing that they 've actually been exceeding in , is communicating across borders , using technologies to organize themselves , to propagate their message and to create truly global phenomena . 
Now I should know , because for 13 years of my life , I was involved in an extreme Islamist organization . 
And I was actually a potent force in spreading ideas across borders , and I witnessed the rise of Islamist extremism as distinct from Islam the faith , and the way in which it influenced my co - religionists across the world . 
And my story , my personal story , is truly evidence for the age of behavior that I 'm attempting to elaborate upon here . 
I was , by the way -- I 'm an Essex lad , born and raised in Essex in the U.K. 
Anyone who 's from England knows the reputation we have from Essex . 
But having been born in Essex , at the age of 16 , I joined an organization . 
At the age of 17 , I was recruiting people from Cambridge University to this organization . 
At the age of 19 , I was on the national leadership of this organization in the U.K. 
At the age of 21 , I was co - founding this organization in Pakistan . 
At the age of 22 , I was co - founding this organization in Denmark . 
By the age of 24 , I found myself convicted in prison in Egypt , being blacklisted from three countries in the world for attempting to overthrow their governments , being subjected to torture in Egyptian jails and sentenced to five years as a prisoner of conscience . 
Now that journey , and what took me from Essex all the way across the world -- by the way , we were laughing at democratic activists . 
We felt they were from the age of yesteryear . 
We felt that they were out of date . 
I learned how to use email from the extremist organization that I used . 
I learned how to effectively communicate across borders without being detected . 
Eventually I was detected , of course , in Egypt . 
But the way in which I learned to use technology to my advantage was because I was within an extremist organization that was forced to think beyond the confines of the nation - state . 
The age of behavior : where ideas and narratives were increasingly defining behavior and identity and allegiances . 
So as I said , we looked to the status quo and ridiculed it . 
And it 's not just Islamist extremists that did this . 
But even if you look across the mood music in Europe of late , far - right fascism is also on the rise . 
A form of anti - Islam rhetoric is also on the rise and it 's transnational . 
And the consequences that this is having is that it 's affecting the political climate across Europe . 
What 's actually happening is that what were previously localized parochialisms , individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another , have become interconnected in a globalized way and have thus become , or are becoming , mainstream . 
Because the Internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world . 
If you look at the rise of far - right fascism across Europe of late , you will see some things that are happening that are influencing domestic politics , yet the phenomenon is transnational . 
In certain countries , mosque minarets are being banned . 
In others , headscarves are being banned . 
In others , kosher and halal meat are being banned , as we speak . 
And on the flip side , we have transnational Islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies . 
And so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream . 
Now that never would have been possible before . 
They would have felt isolated , until these sorts of technologies came around and connected them in a way that made them feel part of a larger phenomenon . 
Where does that leave democracy aspirants ? 
Well I believe they 're getting left far behind . 
And I 'll give you an example here at this stage . 
If any of you remembers the Christmas Day bomb plot : there 's a man called Anwar al - Awlaki . 
As an American citizen , ethnically a Yemeni , in hiding currently in Yemen , who inspired a Nigerian , son of the head of Nigeria 's national bank . 
This Nigerian student studied in London , trained in Yemen , boarded a flight in Amsterdam to attack America . 
In the meanwhile , the Old mentality with a capital O , was represented by his father , the head of the Nigerian bank , warning the CIA that his own son was about to attack , and this warning fell on deaf ears . 
The Old mentality with a capital O , as represented by the nation - state , not yet fully into the age of behavior , not recognizing the power of transnational social movements , got left behind . 
And the Christmas Day bomber almost succeeded in attacking the United States of America . 
Again with the example of the far right : that we find , ironically , xenophobic nationalists are utilizing the benefits of globalization . 
So why are they succeeding ? 
And why are democracy aspirants falling behind ? 
Well we need to understand the power of the social movements who understand this . 
And a social movement is comprised , in my view , it 's comprised of four main characteristics . 
It 's comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders . 
I 'll talk you through one example , and that 's the example that everyone here will be aware of , and that 's the example of Al - Qaeda . 
If I asked you to think of the ideas of Al - Qaeda , that 's something that comes to your mind immediately . 
If I ask you to think of their narratives -- the West being at war with Islam , the need to defend Islam against the West -- these narratives , they come to your mind immediately . 
Incidentally , the difference between ideas and narratives : the idea is the cause that one believes in ; and the narrative is the way to sell that cause -- the propaganda , if you like , of the cause . 
So the ideas and the narratives of Al - Qaeda come to your mind immediately . 
If I ask you to think of their symbols and their leaders , they come to your mind immediately . 
One of their leaders was killed in Pakistan recently . 
So these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately . 
And that 's the power of social movements . 
They 're transnational , and they bond around these ideas and narratives and these symbols and these leaders . 
However , if I ask your minds to focus currently on Pakistan , and I ask you to think of the symbols and the leaders for democracy in Pakistan today , you 'll be hard pressed to think beyond perhaps the assassination of Benazir Bhutto . 
Which means , by definition , that particular leader no longer exists . 
One of the problems we 're facing is , in my view , that there are no globalized , youth - led , grassroots social movements advocating for democratic culture across Muslim - majority societies . 
There is no equivalent of the Al - Qaeda , without the terrorism , for democracy across Muslim - majority societies . 
There are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols advocating the democratic culture on the ground . 
So that begs the next question . 
Why is it that extremist organizations , whether of the far - right or of the Islamist extremism -- Islamism meaning those who wish to impose one version of Islam over the rest of society -- why is it that they are succeeding in organizing in a globalized way , whereas those who aspire to democratic culture are falling behind ? 
And I believe that 's for four reasons . 
I believe , number one , it 's complacency . 
Because those who aspire to democratic culture are in power , or have societies that are leading globalized , powerful societies , powerful countries . 
And that level of complacency means they do n't feel the need to advocate for that culture . 
The second , I believe , is political correctness . 
That we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that -- we associate believing in the universality of our values -- with extremists . 
Yet actually , whenever we talk about human rights , we do say that human rights are universal . 
But actually going out to propagate that view is associated with either neoconservativism or with Islamist extremism . 
To go around saying that I believe democratic culture is the best that we 've arrived at as a form of political organizing is associated with extremism . 
And the third , democratic choice in Muslim - majority societies has been relegated to a political choice , meaning political parties in many of these societies ask people to vote for them as the democratic party , but then the other parties ask them to vote for them as the military party -- wanting to rule by military dictatorship . 
And then you have a third party saying , " Vote for us ; we 'll establish a theocracy . " 
So democracy has become merely one political choice among many other forms of political choices available in those societies . 
And what happens as a result of this is , when those parties are elected , and inevitably they fail , or inevitably they make political mistakes , democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes . 
And then people say , " We 've tried democracy . It does n't really work . 
Let 's bring the military back again . " 
And the fourth reason , I believe , is what I 've labeled here on the slide as the ideology of resistance . 
What I mean by that is , if the world superpower today was a communist , it would be much easier for democracy activists to use democracy activism as a form of resistance against colonialism , than it is today with the world superpower being America , occupying certain lands and also espousing democratic ideals . 
So roughly these four reasons make it a lot more difficult for democratic culture to spread as a civilizational choice , not merely as a political choice . 
When talking about those reasons , let 's break down certain preconceptions . 
Is it just about grievances ? 
Is it just about a lack of education ? 
Well statistically , the majority of those who join extremist organizations are highly educated . 
Statistically , they are educated , on average , above the education levels of Western society . 
Anecdotally , we can demonstrate that if poverty was the only factor , well Bin Laden is from one of the richest families in Saudi Arabia . 
His deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri , was a pediatrician -- not an ill - educated man . 
International aid and development has been going on for years , but extremism in those societies , in many of those societies , has been on the rise . 
And what I believe is missing is genuine grassroots activism on the ground , in addition to international aid , in addition to education , in addition to health . 
Not exclusive to these things , but in addition to them , is propagating a genuine demand for democracy on the ground . 
And this is where I believe neoconservatism had it upside - down . 
Neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply - led approach to impose democratic values from the top down . 
Whereas Islamists and far - right organizations , for decades , have been building demand for their ideology on the grassroots . 
They 've been building civilizational demand for their values on the grassroots , and we 've been seeing those societies slowly transition to societies that are increasingly asking for a form of Islamism . 
Mass movements in Pakistan have been represented after the Arab uprisings mainly by organizations claiming for some form of theocracy , rather than for a democratic uprising . 
Because since pre - partition , they 've been building demand for their ideology on the ground . 
And what 's needed is a genuine transnational youth - led movement that works to actively advocate for the democratic culture -- which is necessarily more than just elections . 
But without freedom of speech , you ca n't have free and fair elections . 
Without human rights , you do n't have the protection granted to you to campaign . 
Without freedom of belief , you do n't have the right to join organizations . 
So what 's needed is those organizations on the ground advocating for the democratic culture itself to create the demand on the ground for this culture . 
What that will do is avoid the problem I was talking about earlier , where currently we have political parties presenting democracy as merely a political choice in those societies alongside other choices such as military rule and theocracy . 
Whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civilizational level , rather than merely on a political level , a level above politics -- movements that are not political parties , but are rather creating this civilizational demand for this democratic culture . 
What we 'll have in the end is this ideal that you see on the slide here -- the ideal that people should vote in an existing democracy , not for a democracy . 
But to get to that stage , where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric , but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship -- i.e. you 're voting in a democracy , in an existing democracy , and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box . 
To get to that stage , we genuinely need to start building demand in those societies on the ground . 
Now to conclude , how does that happen ? 
Well , Egypt is a good starting point . 
The Arab uprisings have demonstrated that this is already beginning . 
But what happened in the Arab uprisings and what happened in Egypt was particularly cathartic for me . 
What happened there was a political coalition gathered together for a political goal , and that was to remove the leader . 
We need to move one step beyond that now . 
We need to see how we can help those societies move from political coalitions , loosely based political coalitions , to civilizational coalitions that are working for the ideals and narratives of the democratic culture on the ground . 
Because it 's not enough to remove a leader or ruler or dictator . 
That does n't guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values . 
But generally , the trends that start in Egypt have historically spread across the MENA region , the Middle East and North Africa region . 
So when Arab socialism started in Egypt , it spread across the region . 
In the ' 80s and ' 90s when Islamism started in the region , it spread across the MENA region as a whole . 
And the aspiration that we have at the moment -- as young Arabs are proving today and instantly rebranding themselves as being prepared to die for more than just terrorism -- is that there is a chance that democratic culture can start in the region and spread across to the rest of the countries that are surrounding that . 
But that will require helping these societies transition from having merely political coalitions to building genuinely grassroots - based social movements that advocate for the democratic culture . 
And we 've made a start for that in Pakistan with a movement called Khudi , where we are working on the ground to encourage the youth to create genuine buy - in for the democratic culture . 
And it 's with that thought that I 'll end . 
And my time is up , and thank you for your time .

Clay Shirky : How social media can make history 
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape , and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world . 
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation . 
I 'll start here . Last November there was a presidential election . 
You probably read something about it in the papers . 
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression . 
And so a plan came up to video the vote . 
And the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video would document their polling places , on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques , and would upload this to a central place . 
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation -- that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes , but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall . 
So this is a pattern that assumes we 're all in this together . 
What matters here is n't technical capital , it 's social capital . 
These tools do n't get socially interesting until they get technologically boring . 
It is n't when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society . 
It 's when everybody is able to take them for granted . 
Because now that media is increasingly social , innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we 're all in this together . 
And so we 're starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere , and moving from one spot to another . 
That is a huge transformation . 
Not to put too fine a point on it , the moment we 're living through -- the moment our historical generation is living through -- is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history . 
Now that 's a big claim . I 'm going to try to back it up . 
There are only four periods in the last 500 years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label " revolution . " 
The first one is the famous one , the printing press : movable type , oil - based inks , that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned Europe upside - down , starting in the middle of the 1400s . 
Then , a couple of hundred years ago , there was innovation in two - way communication , conversational media : first the telegraph , then the telephone . 
Slow , text - based conversations , then real - time voice based conversations . 
Then , about 150 years ago , there was a revolution in recorded media other than print : first photos , then recorded sound , then movies , all encoded onto physical objects . 
And finally , about 100 years ago , the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television . 
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century . 
This is what those of us of a certain age grew up with , and are used to . 
But there is a curious asymmetry here . 
The media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups . 
And the media that 's good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations . 
If you want to have a conversation in this world , you have it with one other person . 
If you want to address a group , you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group , whether you 're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press . 
That was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century . 
And this is what changed . 
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is Bill Cheswick 's map of the Internet . 
He traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them . 
The Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time . 
Whereas the phone gave us the one - to - one pattern , and television , radio , magazines , books , gave us the one - to - many pattern , the Internet gives us the many - to - many pattern . 
For the first time , media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations . 
That 's one of the big changes . 
The second big change is that , as all media gets digitized , the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media , meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet , magazines migrate to the Internet , movies migrate to the Internet . 
And that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium . 
Put another way , media is increasingly less just a source of information , and it is increasingly more a site of coordination , because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well . 
And the third big change is that members of the former audience , as Dan Gilmore calls them , can now also be producers and not consumers . 
Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well , because the same equipment -- phones , computers -- let you consume and produce . 
It 's as if , when you bought a book , they threw in the printing press for free ; it 's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons . 
That is a huge change in the media landscape we 're used to . 
And it 's not just Internet or no Internet . 
We 've had the Internet in its public form for almost 20 years now , and it 's still changing as the media becomes more social . 
It 's still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well . 
Second story . 
Last May , China in the Sichuan province had a terrible earthquake , 7.9 magnitude , massive destruction in a wide area , as the Richter Scale has it . 
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening . 
People were texting from their phones . They were taking photos of buildings . 
They were taking videos of buildings shaking . 
They were uploading it to QQ , China 's largest Internet service . 
They were Twittering it . 
And so as the quake was happening the news was reported . 
And because of the social connections , Chinese students coming elsewhere , and going to school , or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China -- there were people listening all over the world , hearing this news . 
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter . 
Twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody to read . 
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened . 
Now they might have liked to have done that here , rather than seeing these pictures go up online . 
But they were n't given that choice , because their own citizens beat them to the punch . 
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens , rather than from the Xinhua News Agency . 
And this stuff rippled like wildfire . 
For a while there the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter , the global short messaging service -- nine of the top 10 links were about the quake . 
People collating information , pointing people to news sources , pointing people to the US geological survey . 
The 10th one was kittens on a treadmill , but that 's the Internet for you . 
But nine of the 10 in those first hours . 
And within half a day donation sites were up , and donations were pouring in from all around the world . 
This was an incredible , coordinated global response . 
And the Chinese then , in one of their periods of media openness , decided that they were going to let it go , that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly . 
And then this happened . 
People began to figure out , in the Sichuan Provence , that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed -- because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day -- the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code . 
And so they started , the citizen journalists started reporting that as well . And there was an incredible picture . 
You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times . 
A local official literally prostrated himself in the street , in front of these protesters , in order to get them to go away . 
Essentially to say , " We will do anything to placate you , just please stop protesting in public . " 
But these are people who have been radicalized , because , thanks to the one child policy , they have lost everyone in their next generation . 
Someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose . 
And so the protest kept going . 
And finally the Chinese cracked down . 
That was enough of citizen media . 
And so they began to arrest the protesters . 
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on . 
China is probably the most successful manager of Internet censorship in the world , using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China . 
And the Great Firewall of China is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals , it mostly comes in from the outside world , it comes in relatively sparse chunks , and it comes in relatively slowly . 
And because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the country . 
But like the Maginot Line , the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge , because not one of those four things was true in this environment . 
The media was produced locally . It was produced by amateurs . 
It was produced quickly . And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared . 
And so now the Chinese government , who for a dozen years , has quite successfully filtered the web , is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services , because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they ca n't deal with it any other way . 
And in fact that is happening this week . 
On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen they just , two days ago , announced that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter , because there was no way to filter it other than that . 
They had to turn the spigot entirely off . 
Now these changes do n't just affect people who want to censor messages . 
They also affect people who want to send messages , because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole , not just a particular strategy . 
The classic media problem , from the 20th century is , how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network . 
And here is the twentieth century answer . 
Bundle up the message . Send the same message to everybody . 
National message . Targeted individuals . 
Relatively sparse number of producers . 
Very expensive to do , so there is not a lot of competition . 
This is how you reach people . 
All of that is over . 
We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap . 
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world , to the distributed collection of the audience , are now used to this change . 
The audience can talk back . 
And that 's a little freaky . But you can get used to it after a while , as people do . 
But that 's not the really crazy change that we 're living in the middle of . 
The really crazy change is here : it 's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other , the fact that former consumers are now producers , the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another ; because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals , and because the size of the network , the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants , meaning that the network , when it grows large , grows very , very large . 
As recently at last decade , most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals . 
Those days are over , never to return . 
It is the green lines now , that are the source of the free content , which brings me to my last story . 
We saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the Obama campaign . 
And I do n't mean most imaginative use in politics -- I mean most imaginative use ever . 
And one of the things Obama did , was they famously , the Obama campaign did , was they famously put up And millions of citizens rushed in to participate , and to try and figure out how to help . 
An incredible conversation sprung up there . 
And then , this time last year , Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA , The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act . 
He had said , in January , that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons . 
By the summer , in the middle of the general campaign , He said , " I 've thought about the issue more . I 've changed my mind . 
I 'm going to vote for this bill . " 
And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk . 
It was Senator Obama when they created it . They changed the name later . 
" Please get FISA right . " 
Within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com ; within weeks of its being created it was the largest group . 
Obama had to issue a press release . 
He had to issue a reply . 
And he said essentially , " I have considered the issue . 
I understand where you are coming from . 
But having considered it all , I 'm still going to vote the way I 'm going to vote . 
But I wanted to reach out to you and say , I understand that you disagree with me , and I 'm going to take my lumps on this one . " 
This did n't please anybody . But then a funny thing happened in the conversation . 
People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down . 
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join , to deny its existence , to delete it , to take to off the site . 
They had understood that their role with myBO.com was to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters . 
And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media . 
Media , the media landscape that we knew , as familiar as it was , as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs , is increasingly slipping away . 
In a world where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap , in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants , in that world , media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals . 
It is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups . 
And the choice we face , I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world , is n't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in . 
That 's the media environment we 've got . 
The question we all face now is , " How can we make best use of this media ? 
Even though it means changing the way we 've always done it . " 
Thank you very much .

Ken Kamler : Medical miracle on Everest 
OK . We 've heard a lot of people speak at this conference about the power of the human mind . 
And what I 'd like to do today is give you a vivid example of how that power can be unleashed when someone is in a survival situation , how the will to survive can bring that out in people . 
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest ; it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest . 
And when it occurred , I was the only doctor on the mountain . 
So I 'll take you through that and we 'll see what it 's like when someone really summons the will to survive . 
OK , this is Mount Everest . 
It 's 29,035 feet high . 
I 've been there six times : Four times I did work with National Geographic , making tectonic plate measurements ; twice , I went with NASA doing remote sensing devices . 
It was on my fourth trip to Everest that a comet passed over the mountain . Hyakutake . 
And the Sherpas told us then that was a very bad omen , and we should have listened to them . 
Everest is an extreme environment . 
There 's only one - third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level . 
Near the summit , temperatures can be 40 degrees below zero . 
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour . 
It 's actually a wind - chill factor which is lower than a summer day on Mars . 
I remember one time being up near the summit , I reached into my down jacket for a drink from my water bottle , inside my down jacket , only to discover that the water was already frozen solid . 
That gives you an idea of just how severe things are near the summit . 
OK , this is the route up Everest . 
It starts at base camp , at 17,500 feet . 
Camp One , 2,000 feet higher . 
Camp Two , another 2,000 feet higher up , what 's called the Western Cwm . 
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse , which is the fourth highest mountain in the world , but it 's dwarfed by Everest . 
And then Camp Four is the highest camp ; that 's 3,000 feet short of the summit . 
This is a view of base camp . 
This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet . 
It 's the highest point you can bring your yaks before you have to unload . 
And this is what they unloaded for me : I had four yak loads of medical supplies , which are dumped in a tent , and here I am trying to arrange things . 
This was our expedition . 
It was a National Geographic expedition , but it was organized by The Explorers Club . 
There were three other expeditions on the mountain , an American team , a New Zealand team and an IMAX team . 
And , after actually two months of preparation , we built our camps all the way up the mountain . 
This is a view looking up the icefall , the first 2,000 feet of the climb up from base camp . 
And here 's a picture in the icefall ; it 's a waterfall , but it 's frozen , but it moves very slowly , and it actually changes every day . 
When you 're in it , you 're like a rat in a maze ; you ca n't even see over the top . 
This is near the top of the icefall . 
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen . 
That way , it 's less likely to tumble down on you . 
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun - up . 
This is me crossing a crevasse . 
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached . 
That 's another crevasse . 
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more , and one of my climbing friends says that the reason we actually climb at night is because if we ever saw the bottom of what we 're climbing over , we would never do it . 
Okay . This is Camp One . 
It 's the first flat spot you can reach after you get up to the top of the icefall . 
And from there we climb up to Camp Two , which is sort of the foreground . 
These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face , that mountain toward Camp Three . 
They 're on fixed ropes here . 
A fall here , if you were n't roped in , would be 5,000 feet down . 
This is a view taken from camp three . 
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile , it 's about a 45 degree angle . It takes two days to climb it , so you put the camp halfway through . 
If you notice , the summit of Everest is black . 
There 's no ice over it . 
And that 's because Everest is so high , it 's in the jet stream , and winds are constantly scouring the face , so no snow gets to accumulate . 
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge is actually snow being blown off the summit . 
This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four , moving in , up through the clouds . 
And this is at Camp Four . 
Once you get to Camp Four , you have maybe 24 hours to decide if you 're going to go for the summit or not . 
Everybody 's on oxygen , your supplies are limited , and you either have to go up or go down , make that decision very quickly . 
This is a picture of Rob Hall . 
He was the leader of the New Zealand team . 
This is a radio he used later to call his wife that I 'll tell you about . 
These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit . 
They 're up at Camp Four , and you can see that there 's wind blowing off the summit . 
This is not good weather to climb in , so the climbers are just waiting , hoping that the wind 's going to die down . 
And , in fact , the wind does die down at night . 
It becomes very calm , there 's no wind at all . 
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit . 
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit on what 's called the Triangular Face . 
It 's the first part of climb . 
It 's done in the dark , because it 's actually less steep than what comes next , and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark . 
So that 's what happened . 
The climbers got on the southeast ridge . 
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge . 
The summit would be in the foreground . 
From here , it 's about 1,500 feet up at a 30-degree angle to the summit . 
But what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up . 
A storm blew in that no one was anticipating . 
You can see here some ferocious winds blowing snow way high off the summit . 
And there were climbers on that summit ridge . 
This is a picture of me in that area taken a year before , and you can see I 've got an oxygen mask on with a rebreather . 
I have an oxygen hose connected here . 
You can see on this climber , we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack -- little titanium tanks , very lightweight -- and we 're not carrying much else . 
This is all you 've got . You 're very exposed on the summit ridge . 
OK , this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself . 
This is on the way toward the summit , on that 1,500-foot bridge . 
All the climbers here are climbing unroped , and the reason is because the drop off is so sheer on either side that if you were roped to somebody , you 'd wind up just pulling them off with you . 
So each person climbs individually . 
And it 's not a straight path at all , it 's very difficult climbing , and there 's always the risk of falling on either side . 
If you fall to your left , you 're going to fall 8,000 feet into Nepal ; if you fall to your right , you 're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet . 
So it 's probably better to fall into Tibet because you 'll live longer . 
But , either way , you fall for the rest of your life . 
OK . Those climbers were up near the summit , along that summit ridge that you see up there , and I was down here in Camp Three . 
My expedition was down in Camp Three , while these guys were up there in the storm . 
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay , fully dressed , fully equipped , laid out on the tent floor to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain . 
It was the worst winds I 've ever seen . 
And the climbers up on the ridge were that much higher , 2,000 feet higher , and completely exposed to the elements . 
We were in radio contact with some of them . 
This is a view taken along the summit ridge . 
Rob Hall , we heard by radio , was up here , at this point in the storm with Doug Hansen . 
And we heard that Rob was OK , but Doug was too weak to come down . 
He was exhausted , and Rob was staying with him . 
We also got some bad news in the storm that Beck Weathers , another climber , had collapsed in the snow and was dead . 
There were still 18 other climbers that we were n't aware of their condition . 
They were lost . There was total confusion on the mountain ; all the stories were confusing , most of them were conflicting . 
We really had no idea what was going on during that storm . 
We were just hunkered down in our tents at Camp Three . 
Our two strongest climbers , Todd Burleson and Pete Athans , decided to go up to try to rescue who they could even though there was a ferocious storm going . 
They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall , who was a superb climber stuck , sort of , with a weak climber up near the summit . 
I expected them to say to Rob , " Hold on . We 're coming . " 
But in fact , what they said was , " Leave Doug and come down yourself . 
There 's no chance of saving him , and just try to save yourself at this point . " 
And Rob got that message , but his answer was , " We 're both listening . " 
Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge , up in here , and it was a scene of complete chaos up there . 
But they did what they could to stabilize the people . 
I gave them radio advice from Camp Three , and we sent down the climbers that could make it down under their own power . 
The ones that could n't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four . 
So the climbers were coming down along this route . 
This is taken from Camp Three , where I was . 
And they all came by me so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them , which is really not much , because Camp Three is a little notch cut in the ice in the middle of a 45-degree angle . 
You can barely stand outside the tent . 
It 's really cold ; it 's 24,000 feet . 
The only supplies I had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids . 
So , as the climbers came by me , I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down . 
The ones that were n't that lucid or were not that well coordinated , I would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain . 
It 's so awkward to work up there that sometimes I even gave the injections right through their clothes . 
It was just too hard to maneuver any other way up there . 
While I was taking care of them , we got more news about Rob Hall . 
There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him . 
He called in to say that he was alone now . 
Apparently , Doug had died higher up on the mountain . 
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself , and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude , he was just beyond rescue and he knew it . 
At that point , he asked to be paged into his wife . 
He was carrying a radio . 
His wife was home in New Zealand , seven months pregnant with their first child , and Rob asked to be patched into her . That was done , and Rob and his wife had their last conversation . 
They picked the name for their baby . 
Rob then signed off , and that was the last we ever heard of him . 
I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients at 24,000 feet , which was an impossibility . 
So what we did was , we got the victims down to 21,000 feet , where it was easier for me to treat them . 
This was my medical kit . 
It 's a tackle box filled with medical supplies . 
This is what I carried up the mountain . 
I had more supplies lower down , which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp . 
And this was scene at the lower camp . 
The survivors came in one by one . 
Some of them were hypothermic , some of them were frostbitten , some were both . 
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could , put oxygen on them and try to revive them , which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet , when the tent is freezing . 
This is some severe frostbite on the feet , severe frostbite on the nose . 
This climber was snow blind . 
As I was taking care of these climbers , we got a startling experience . 
Out of nowhere , Beck Weathers , who we had already been told was dead , stumbled into the tent , just like a mummy , he walked into the tent . 
I expected him to be incoherent , but , in fact , he walked into the tent and said to me , " Hi , Ken . Where should I sit ? " 
And then he said , " Do you accept my health insurance ? " 
He really said that . 
So he was completely lucid , but he was very severely frostbitten . 
You can see his hand is completely white ; his face , his nose , is burned . 
First , it turns white , and then when it 's completed necrosis , it turns black , and then it falls off . 
It 's the last stage , just like a scar . 
So , as I was taking care of Beck , he related what had been going on up there . 
He said he had gotten lost in the storm , collapsed in the snow , and just laid there , unable to move . 
Some climbers had come by and looked at him , and he heard them say , " He 's dead . " 
But Beck was n't dead ; he heard that , but he was completely unable to move . 
He was in some sort of catatonic state where he could be aware of his surroundings , but could n't even blink to indicate that he was alive . 
So the climbers passed him by , and Beck lay there for a day , a night and another day , in the snow . 
And then he said to himself , " I do n't want to die . 
I have a family to come back to . " 
And the thoughts of his family , his kids and his wife , generated enough energy , enough motivation in him , so that he actually got up . 
After laying in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp . 
And Beck told me that story very quietly , but I was absolutely stunned by it . 
I could n't imagine anybody laying in the snow that long a time and then getting up . 
He apparently reversed an irreversible hypothermia . 
And I can only try to speculate on how he did it . 
So , what if we had Beck hooked up to a SPECT scan , something that could actually measure brain function ? 
Just very simply , the three parts of the brain : the frontal lobe , where you focus your attention and concentration ; you have the temporal lobe , where you form images and keep memories ; and the posterior part of your brain , which contains the cerebellum , which controls motion ; and the brain stem , where you have your basic maintenance functions , like heartbeat and respiration . 
So let 's take a cut through the brain here , and imagine that Beck was hooked up to a SPECT scan . 
This measures dynamic blood flow and therefore energy flow within the brain . 
So you have the prefrontal cortex here , lighting up in red . 
This is a pretty evenly distributed scan . 
You have the middle area , where the temporal lobe might be , in here , and the posterior portion , where the maintenance functions are in the back . 
This is a roughly normal scan , showing equal distribution of energy . 
Now , you go to this one and you see how much more the frontal lobes are lighting up . 
This might be what Beck would be experiencing when he realizes he 's in danger . 
He 's focusing all his attention on getting himself out of trouble . 
These parts of the brain are quieting down . 
He 's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point , and he 's working pretty hard . 
He 's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this . 
OK , but he 's losing ground here . 
He 's running out of energy . 
It 's too cold ; he ca n't keep his metabolic fires going , and , you see , there 's no more red here ; his brain is quieting down . 
He 's collapsed in the snow here . Everything is quiet , there 's very little red anywhere . 
Beck is powering down . 
He 's dying . 
You go on to the next scan , but , in Beck 's case , you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again . 
He 's beginning to think about his family . 
He 's beginning to have images that are motivating him to get up . 
He 's developing energy in this area through thought . 
And this is how he 's going to turn thought back into action . 
This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus . 
It 's an area in which a lot of neuroscientists believe the seat of will exists . 
This is where people make decisions , where they develop willpower . 
And , you can see , there 's an energy flow going from the mid portion of his brain , where he 's got images of his family , into this area , which is powering his will . 
Okay . This is getting stronger and stronger to the point where it 's actually going to be a motivating factor . 
He 's going to develop enough energy in that area -- after a day , a night and a day -- to actually motivate himself to get up . 
And you can see here , he 's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe . 
He 's beginning to focus , he can concentrate now . 
He 's thinking about what he 's got to do to save himself . 
So this energy has been transmitted up toward the front of his brain , and it 's getting quieter down here , but he 's using this energy to think about what he has to do to get himself going . 
And then , that energy is sort of spreading throughout his thought areas . 
He 's not thinking about his family now , and he 's getting himself motivated . 
This is the posterior part , where his muscles are going to be moving , and he 's going to be pacing himself . 
His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed . 
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck during this survival epic . 
So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet , and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial compared to what he had done for himself . 
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do . 
He was critically ill , there were other critically ill patients ; luckily , we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys . 
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history . 
It was able to land on the ice , take away Beck and the other survivors , one by one , and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic before we even got back to base camp . 
This is a scene at base camp , at one of the camps where some of the climbers were lost . 
And we had a memorial service there a few days later . 
These are Serphas lighting juniper branches . 
They believe juniper smoke is holy . 
And the climbers stood around on the high rocks and spoke of the climbers who were lost up near the summit , turning to the mountain , actually , to talk to them directly . 
There were five climbers lost here . 
This was Scott Fischer , Rob Hall , Andy Harris , Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba . 
And one more climber should have died that day , but did n't , and that 's Beck Weathers . 
He was able to survive because he was able to generate that incredible willpower , he was able to use all the power of his mind to save himself . 
These are Tibetan prayer flags . 
These Sherpas believe that if you write prayers on these flags , the message will be carried up to the gods , and that year , Beck 's message was answered . 
Thank you .

Nandan Nilekani , the visionary co - founder of outsourcing pioneer Infosys , explains four brands of ideas that will determine whether India can continue its recent breakneck progress . 
business , development , economics , global issues , politics , potential , technology , third world

Nandan Nilekani 's ideas for India 's future 
Let me talk about India through the evolution of ideas . 
Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it because in every society , especially an open democratic society , it 's only when ideas take root that things change . 
Slowly ideas lead to ideology , lead to policies that lead to actions . 
In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression , which led to all the ideas of the state and social security , and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt 's time . 
In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution , which lead to deregulation . 
And today , after the global economic crisis , there was a whole new set of rules about how the state should intervene . 
So ideas change states . 
And I looked at India and said , really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on India . 
The first , to my mind , is what I call as " the ideas that have arrived . " 
These ideas have brought together something which has made India happen the way it is today . 
The second set of ideas I call " ideas in progress . " 
Those are ideas which have been accepted but not implemented yet . 
The third set of ideas are what I call as " ideas that we argue about " -- those are ideas where we have a fight , an ideological battle about how to do things . 
And the fourth thing , which I believe is most important , is " the ideas that we need to anticipate . " 
Because when you are a developing country in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having , you can actually anticipate what that did and do things very differently . 
Now in India 's case I believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today . 
The first is really the notion of people . 
In the ' 60s and ' 70s we thought of people as a burden . 
We thought of people as a liability . 
Today we talk of people as an asset . 
We talk of people as human capital . 
And I believe this change in the mindset , of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital , has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset . 
And this change in thinking of human capital is linked to the fact that India is going through a demographic dividend . 
As healthcare improves , as infant mortality goes down , fertility rates start dropping . And India is experiencing that . 
India is going to have a lot of young people with a demographic dividend for the next 30 years . 
What is unique about this demographic dividend is that India will be the only country in the world to have this demographic dividend . 
In other words , it will be the only young country in an aging world . 
And this is very important . At the same time if you peel away the demographic dividend in India , there are actually two demographic curves . 
One is in the south and in the west of India , which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015 , because in that part of the country , the fertility rate is almost equal to that of a West European country . 
Then there is the whole northern India , which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend . 
But a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital . 
Only if the people have education , they have good health , they have infrastructure , they have roads to go to work , they have lights to study at night -- only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend . 
In other words , if you do n't really invest in the human capital , the same demographic dividend can be a demographic disaster . 
Therefore India is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster . 
The second thing in India has been the change in the role of entrepreneurs . 
When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot , as people who would exploit . 
But today , after 60 years , because of the rise of entrepreneurship , entrepreneurs have become role models , and they are contributing hugely to the society . 
This change has contributed to the vitality and the whole economy . 
The third big thing I believe that has changed India is our attitude towards the English language . 
English language was seen as a language of the imperialists . 
But today , with globalization , with outsourcing , English has become a language of aspiration . 
This has made it something that everybody wants to learn . 
And the fact that we have English is now becoming a huge strategic asset . 
The next thing is technology . 
Forty years back , computers were seen as something which was forbidding , something which was intimidating , something that reduced jobs . 
Today we live in a country which sells eight million mobile phones a month , of which 90 percent of those mobile phones are prepaid phones because people do n't have credit history . 
Forty percent of those prepaid phones are recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge . 
That is the scale at which technology has liberated and made it accessible . 
And therefore technology has gone from being seen as something forbidding and intimidating to something that is empowering . 
Twenty years back , when there was a report on bank computerization , they did n't name the report as a report on computers , they call them as " ledger posting machines . " 
They did n't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers . 
And when they wanted to have more advanced , more powerful computers they called them " advanced ledger posting machines . " 
So we have come a long way from those days where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment , and really has changed the way Indians think of technology . 
And then I think the other point is that Indians today are far more comfortable with globalization . 
Again , after having lived for more than 200 years under the East India Company and under imperial rule , Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism . 
But today , as Indian companies go abroad , as Indians come and work all over the world , Indians have gained a lot more confidence and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in . 
And the fact that the demographics are in our favor , because we are the only young country in an aging world , makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians . 
And finally , India has had the deepening of its democracy . 
When democracy came to India 60 years back it was an elite concept . 
It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy because they wanted to bring in the idea of universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth . 
But today democracy has become a bottom - up process where everybody has realized the benefits of having a voice , the benefits of being in an open society . 
And therefore democracy has become embedded . 
I believe these six factors -- the rise of the notion of population as human capital , the rise of Indian entrepreneurs , the rise of English as a language of aspiration , technology as something empowering , globalization as a positive factor , and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed to why India is today growing at rates it has never seen before . 
But having said that , then we come to what I call as ideas in progress . 
Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society , but you are not able to implement those things . 
And really there are four things here . 
One is the question of education . 
For some reason , whatever reason -- lack of money , lack of priorities , because of religion having an older culture -- primary education was never given the focus it required . 
But now I believe it 's reached a point where it has become very important . 
Unfortunately the government schools do n't function , so children are going to private schools today . 
Even in the slums of India more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools . 
So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work . 
But having said that , there is an enormous desire among everybody , including the poor , to educate their children . 
So I believe primary education is an idea which is arrived but not yet implemented . 
Similarly , infrastructure -- for a long time , infrastructure was not a priority . 
Those of you who have been to India have seen that . 
It 's certainly not like China . 
But today I believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement . 
It is reflected in the political statements . 
20 years back the political slogan was , " Roti , kapada , makaan , " which meant , " Food , clothing and shelter . " 
And today 's political slogan is , " Bijli , sadak , pani , " which means " Electricity , water and roads . " 
And that is a change in the mindset where infrastructure is now accepted . 
So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived , but simply not implemented . 
The third thing is again cities . 
It 's because Gandhi believed in villages and because the British ruled from the cities , therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un - Indian city . 
For a long time we have neglected our cities . 
And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see . 
But today , finally , after economic reforms , and economic growth , I think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth , cities are engines of creativity , cities are engines of innovation , have finally been accepted . 
And I think now you 're seeing the move towards improving our cities . 
Again , an idea which is arrived , but not yet implemented . 
The final thing is the notion of India as a single market -- because when you did n't think of India as a market , you did n't really bother about a single market , because it did n't really matter . 
And therefore you had a situation where every state had its own market for products . 
Every province had its own market for agriculture . 
Increasingly now the policies of taxation and infrastructure and all that , are moving towards creating India as a single market . 
So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening , which is as important as external globalization . 
These four factors I believe -- the ones of primary education , infrastructure , urbanization , and single market -- in my view are ideas in India which have been accepted , but not implemented . 
Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict . 
The ideas that we argue about . 
These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock . 
What are those ideas ? One is , I think , are ideological issues . 
Because of the historical Indian background , in the caste system , and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold , a lot of the politics is about how to make sure that we 'll address that . 
And it leads to reservations and other techniques . 
It 's also related to the way that we subsidize our people , and all the left and right arguments that we have . 
A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology of caste and other things . 
This policy is causing gridlock . 
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved . 
The second one is the labor policies that we have , which make it so difficult for entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies , that 93 percent of Indian labor is in the unorganized sector . 
They have no benefits : they do n't have social security ; they do n't have pension ; they do n't have healthcare ; none of those things . 
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people into the formal workforce , you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised . 
Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws , which are not as onerous as they are today . 
At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector , and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for . 
The third thing is our higher education . 
Indian higher education is completely regulated . 
It 's very difficult to start a private university . 
It 's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India . 
As a result of that our higher education is simply not keeping pace with India 's demands . 
That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address . 
But most important I believe are the ideas we need to anticipate . 
Here India can look at what is happening in the west and elsewhere , and look at what needs to be done . 
The first thing is , we 're very fortunate that technology is at a point where it is much more advanced than when other countries had the development . 
So we can use technology for governance . 
We can use technology for direct benefits . 
We can use technology for transparency , and many other things . 
The second thing is , the health issue . 
India has equally horrible health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue , the higher state of diabetes , the higher state of obesity . 
So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases with a set of rich country diseases . 
Therefore we 're to rethink the whole way we look at health . 
We really need to put in place a strategy so that we do n't go to the other extreme of health . 
Similarly today in the West you 're seeing the problem of entitlement -- the cost of social security , the cost of Medicare , the cost of Medicaid . 
Therefore when you are a young country , again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system so that you do n't create entitlement problems as you grow old . 
And then again , India does not have the luxury of making its environment dirty , because it has to marry environment and development . 
Just to give an idea , the world has to stabilize at something like 20 gigatons per year . 
On a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year . 
India is already at two tons per year . 
But if India grows at something like eight percent , income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050 . 
So we 're saying : income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon . 
Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment , the way we look at energy , the way we create whole new paradigms of development . 
Now why does this matter to you ? 
Why does what 's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you ? 
Number one , this matters because this represents more than a billion people . 
A billion people , 1/6th of the world population . 
It matters because this is a democracy . 
And it is important to prove that growth and democracy are not incompatible , that you can have a democracy , that you can have an open society , and you can have growth . 
It 's important because if you solve these problems , you can solve the problems of poverty in the world . 
It 's important because you need it to solve the world 's environment problems . 
If we really want to come to a point , we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission , we want to really lower the use of energy -- it has to be solved in countries like India . 
You know if you look at the development in the West over 200 years , the average growth may have been about two percent . 
Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent . 
And that makes a huge difference . 
When India was growing at about three , 3.5 percent and the population was growing at two percent , its per capita income was doubling every 45 years . 
When the economic growth goes to eight percent and population growth drops to 1.5 percent , then per capita income is doubling every nine years . 
In other words , you 're certainly fast - forwarding this whole process of a billion people going to prosperity . 
And you must have a clear strategy which is important for India and important for the world . 
That is why I think all of you should be equally concerned with it as I am . 
Thank you very much .

Five great revolutions have shaped political culture over the past 50 years , says theorist Ivan Krastev . He shows how each step forward -- from the cultural revolution of the ‘ 60s to recent revelations in the field of neuroscience -- has also helped erode trust in the tools of democracy . As he says , " What went right is also what went wrong . " Can democracy survive ?

Ivan Krastev : Can democracy exist without trust ? 
I 'm afraid I 'm one of those speakers you hope you 're not going to meet at TED . 
First , I do n't have a mobile , so I 'm on the safe side . 
Secondly , a political theorist who 's going to talk about the crisis of democracy is probably not the most exciting topic you can think about . 
And plus , I 'm not going to give you any answers . 
I 'm much more trying to add to some of the questions we 're talking about . 
And one of the things that I want to question is this very popular hope these days that transparency and openness can restore the trust in democratic institutions . 
There is one more reason for you to be suspicious about me . 
You people , the Church of TED , are a very optimistic community . 
Basically you believe in complexity , but not in ambiguity . 
As you have been told , I 'm Bulgarian . 
And according to the surveys , we are marked the most pessimistic people in the world . 
The Economist magazine recently wrote an article covering one of the recent studies on happiness , and the title was " The Happy , the Unhappy and the Bulgarians . " 
So now when you know what to expect , let 's give you the story . 
And this is a rainy election day in a small country -- that can be my country , but could be also your country . 
And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon , nobody went to the polling stations . 
But then the rain stopped , people went to vote . 
And when the votes had been counted , three - fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot . 
The government and the opposition , they have been simply paralyzed . 
Because you know what to do about the protests . 
You know who to arrest , who to negotiate with . 
But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot ? 
So the government decided to have the elections once again . 
And this time even a greater number , 83 percent of the people , voted with blank ballots . 
Basically they went to the ballot boxes to tell that they have nobody to vote for . 
This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago called " Seeing . " 
But in my view it very well captures part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days . 
On one level nobody 's questioning that democracy is the best form of government . 
Democracy is the only game in town . 
The problem is that many people start to believe that it is not a game worth playing . 
For the last 30 years , political scientists have observed that there is a constant decline in electoral turnout , and the people who are least interested to vote are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting . 
I mean the unemployed , the under - privileged . 
And this is a major issue . 
Because especially now with the economic crisis , you can see that the trust in politics , that the trust in democratic institutions , was really destroyed . 
According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission , 89 percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap between the opinion of the policy - makers and the opinion of the public . 
Only 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeks believe that their vote matters . 
Basically people start to understand that they can change governments , but they can not change policies . 
And the question which I want to ask is the following : How did it happen that we are living in societies which are much freer than ever before -- we have more rights , we can travel easier , we have access to more information -- at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions basically has collapsed ? 
So basically I want to ask : What went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ? 
And I 'll start with what went right . 
And the first thing that went right was , of course , these five revolutions which , in my view , very much changed the way we 're living and deepened our democratic experience . 
And the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s , which put the individual at the center of politics . 
It was the human rights moment . 
Basically this was also a major outbreak , a culture of dissent , a culture of basically non - conformism , which was not known before . 
So I do believe that even things like that are very much the children of ' 68 -- nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then . 
But after that you have the market revolution of the 1980s . 
And nevertheless that many people on the left try to hate it , the truth is that it was very much the market revolution that sent the message : " The government does not know better . " 
And you have more choice - driven societies . 
And of course , you have 1989 -- the end of Communism , the end of the Cold War . 
And it was the birth of the global world . 
And you have the Internet . 
And this is not the audience to which I 'm going to preach to what extent the Internet empowered people . 
It has changed the way we are communicating and basically we are viewing politics . 
The very idea of political community totally has changed . 
And I 'm going to name one more revolution , and this is the revolution in brain sciences , which totally changed the way we understand how people are making decisions . 
So this is what went right . 
But if we 're going to see what went wrong , we 're going to end up with the same five revolutions . 
Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s , cultural and social revolution , which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose . 
The very idea , all these collective nouns that we have been taught about -- nation , class , family . 
We start to like divorcing , if we 're married at all . 
All this was very much under attack . 
And it is so difficult to engage people in politics when they believe that what really matters is where they personally stand . 
And you have the market revolution of the 1980s and the huge increase of inequality in societies . 
Remember , until the 1970s , the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality . 
The more democratic our societies have been , the more equal they have been becoming . 
Now we have the reverse tendency . 
The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied by the increase in inequality . 
And I find this very much disturbing when we 're talking about what 's going on right and wrong with democracy these days . 
And if you go to 1989 -- something that basically you do n't expect that anybody 's going to criticize -- but many are going to tell you , " Listen , it was the end of the Cold War that tore the social contract between the elites and the people in Western Europe . " 
When the Soviet Union was still there , the rich and the powerful , they needed the people , because they feared them . 
Now the elites basically have been liberated . 
They 're very mobile . You can not tax them . 
And basically they do n't fear the people . 
So as a result of it , you have this very strange situation in which the elites basically got out of the control of the voters . 
So this is not by accident that the voters are not interested to vote anymore . 
And when we talk about the Internet , yes , it 's true , the Internet connected all of us , but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to . 
And it 's becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you . 
I know that many people here have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation , but [ have you ] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days ? 
This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution . 
This is the other side of the things that we like . 
And when you go to the brain sciences , what political consultants learned from the brain scientists is do n't talk to me about ideas anymore , do n't talk to me about policy programs . 
What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people . 
And you have this very strongly to the extent that , even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days , these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas . 
Before , revolutions used to have ideological names . 
They could be communist , they could be liberal , they could be fascist or Islamic . 
Now the revolutions are called under the medium which is most used . 
You have Facebook revolutions , Twitter revolutions . 
The content does n't matter anymore , the problem is the media . 
I 'm saying this because one of my major points is what went right is also what went wrong . 
And when we 're now trying to see how we can change the situation , when basically we 're trying to see what can be done about democracy , we should keep this ambiguity in mind . 
Because probably some of the things that we love most are going to be also the things that can hurt us most . 
These days it 's very popular to believe that this push for transparency , this kind of a combination between active citizens , new technologies and much more transparency - friendly legislation can restore trust in politics . 
You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this , it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie , it 's going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill . 
This is probably true . 
But I do believe that we should be also very clear that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics where the message is that transparency is stupid . 
Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions . 
Transparency is politics ' management of mistrust . 
We are assuming that our societies are going to be based on mistrust . 
And by the way , mistrust was always very important for democracy . 
This is why you have checks and balances . 
This is why basically you have all this creative mistrust between the representatives and those whom they represent . 
But when politics is only management of mistrust , then -- I 'm very glad that " 1984 " has been mentioned -- now we 're going to have " 1984 " in reverse . 
It 's not going to be the Big Brother watching you , it 's going to be we being the Big Brother watching the political class . 
But is this the idea of a free society ? 
For example , can you imagine that decent , civic , talented people are going to run for office if they really do believe that politics is also about managing mistrust ? 
Are you not afraid with all these technologies that are going to track down any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues , are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians to repeat their positions , even the very wrong positions , because consistency is going to be more important than common sense ? 
And the Americans who are in the room , are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern on the basis of what they said in the primary elections ? 
I find this extremely important , because democracy is about people changing their views based on rational arguments and discussions . 
And we can lose this with the very noble idea to keep people accountable for showing the people that we 're not going to tolerate politicians the opportunism in politics . 
So for me this is extremely important . 
And I do believe that when we 're discussing politics these days , probably it makes sense to look also at this type of a story . 
But also do n't forget , any unveiling is also veiling . 
[ Regardless of ] how transparent our governments want to be , they 're going to be selectively transparent . 
In a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision -- it is a real case story -- that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the Internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place . 
And the public was extremely all for it . 
So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister , why he made this decision . 
He said , " Listen , this is the best way to keep the mouths of my ministers closed . 
Because it 's going to be very difficult for them to dissent knowing that 24 hours after this is going to be on the public space , and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis . " 
So when we talk about transparency , when we talk about openness , I really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong . 
And this is Goethe , who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist , some centuries ago he said , " There is a big shadow where there is much light . " 
Thank you very much .

Deborah Scranton on her " War Tapes " 
Three years ago , I got a phone call , based on an earlier film I had made , with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard . 
My idea -- and literally , I woke up in the middle of the night , and we 've all have those moments . You know , you go to sleep -- I was excited , with this phone call . 
I was thinking , I just finished making another film about World War II vets , and I realized I 'd gotten to know their stories , and I realized this was a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior 's story as it unfolded . 
So I went to bed that night pretty excited . 
Not sure of all the details , but excited . 
It was n't at four in the morning , but it was closer to midnight . 
Woke straight up . Wide - awake as could be . 
And I had this idea : what if I could , in effect , virtually embed , and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers ? 
To tell the story from the inside out , versus the outside in ? 
So , I called back Major Heilshorn , who 's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard . 
And he knew me , so I was like , " Greg ? " 
He 's like , " Yes , Deborah ? " 
Told him my idea , and you know , he is one of the bravest men in the world , as is General Blair , who , in the end , gave me permission to try this experiment . 
Within 10 days , I was down at Fort Dix . 
He gave me my pick of units . 
I picked one unit -- Charlie Company , Third of the 172nd , they 're mountain infantry -- for two reasons . 
One , they 're infantry . 
Number two , they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda , so I knew they would have Internet access . 
The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer . 
This was a big thing that I think when Major H told me , I was n't really totally gathering what that would mean . 
So what that meant was , when I went down to Fort Dix , I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision . 
You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got . 
The opening one was , " What the fuck do you know about the National Guard ? " 
I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars . 
Gave them about a nine minute response , and there we went . 
So , I 'd like to show the clip of the film . 
It 's our trailer , because I know , obviously you guys are busy , many of you may not have had a chance to see it . 
So , I want to show the trailer , and then I 'm going to take apart one scene in detail . 
If we could roll ? 
Stephen Pink : This is Sergeant Stephen Pink . 
Michael Moriarty : Specialist Michael Moriarty . 
Zack Bazzi : Do I really want to go ? Probably not . 
Soldier : We 're not supposed to talk to the media . 
SP : I 'm not the media , dammit ! 
MM : The day is here . Life will change . 
Voice : The real deal , man ! Narrator : You ready ? 
Soldier : Bring it on ! Narrator : You ready ? Voice 2 : Iraq , here we come ! 
ZB : Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat . 
It 's natural instinct . 
SP : If you let fear get to you , then you 're not going to be doing your job . 
MM : Every single time you go out there , there 's attacks . 
It 's unbelievable . 
ZB : Hey , Nestor , your ass crack is right in my face . 
Soldiers : IV ! Are we on fire ? IV ! 
Man down ! Man down ! 
MM : Keep going , brother . You wanna play ? 
Michael Moriarty 's Wife : It 's really hard for him to not have his dad . 
MM : This little kid is in the middle of a war zone . 
Stephen Pink 's Girlfriend : In the beginning , he 's like , " Write something dirty ! " 
George W. Bush : The world 's newest democracy . 
MM : They 're shooting at me . 
SP : You do n't put 150,000 troops in there , and say we 're there to create democracy . 
Soldier : We 've got a drive through window at Burger King now . 
SP : We 're here to create money . 
MM : I support George Bush . We 're not there for the oil . 
Jon Baril : The worst thing in my life . 
SP : Baril , do n't look at it , bud . 
Michael Moriarty 's Wife : He 's not the same person anymore . 
MM : I will not go back . 
Kevin Shangraw : The Iraqi people are who we are there to help -- and we just killed one . 
Soldiers : Sergeant Smith is down ! Sergeant Smith is down ? 
There they are ! Right there ! Fire , fire ! 
JB : It 'll be a better country in 20 years , 'cause we were there . 
I hope . 
Deborah Scranton : Thank you . 
One of the things I 'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about . 
And I 'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED . 
I do n't know how many of you might imagine it , but there 's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq . 
Paul ? Come on , stand up . 
This is Paul Anthony . 
He served -- -- with the Marines , and I want to tell you a little , brief story . 
We were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software . 
Right ? And we started talking . 
People will see my tag , and they 'll see " The War Tapes , " and then we 'll start talking about war . 
We got in a conversation with some other people in the class , and it went on and on . 
I mean , we were there for an hour , talking . 
And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with , which is , I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war , and about politics . 
And really -- because maybe we 're going to disagree . 
Maybe it 's going to get uncomfortable . 
How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation ? 
And you know , Paul was talking , and he then turned to Constance and said , " You know , I would n't have this conversation if she were n't here , because I know she has my back . " 
And I want to say , I was nervous . 
Because I 'm used to doing Q&As . 
I really related to what James was saying yesterday , because I 'm behind the camera . 
You know , I can answer questions about my movie , but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time . 
So , I wanted to say , Paul , I 'm happy you 're here , because I know you have my back . 
This film was not about the Internet , but it could not have been made without it . 
The guys ' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me . 
In the meantime , the soldiers -- we would email and IM . 
I did n't save all of them , because I did n't realize at the beginning that it would be something that I would want to keep track of . 
But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages that I was able to save . 
The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it . 
So I wanted to show you a clip , and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together . 
If we could roll the clip . 
SP : Today is sport . [ Unclear ] Radio : [ Unclear ] Christian soldiers . 
SP : We like to give these insurgents a fair chance . 
So , what we do , we ride with the windows down . 
Because , you know , we obviously have the advantage . I 'm just kidding . 
We do n't fucking ride with the goddam windows down . 
It 's not true . Very unsafe . 
Whoa . 
Soldier : Right there . 
SP : All right , let 's get over to that site . 
Be advised , we 're leaving Taji right now . 
We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji , we 're heading to that location now . 
Soldier : That 's a fucking car bomb ! 
Soldier : Motherfuckers ! 
Soldiers : Get your vest on ! 
Hey , get over the fucking -- yeah , yeah . 
Any one - four elements get to the gate ! 
SP : Sheriff one - six , or any one - four elements , we need you at the gate of Taji right now , over . 
Soldier : I 'll walk you through it . 
SP : Stay low . Head over to the right . 
Get your bag , get your bag ! 
SP : It was mass casualties . 
Probably 20 dead , at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis . 
SP : It just looked like , you know , someone had thrown a quarter through a guy , and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds . 
Everything was cauterized , and it was just like there was a void going through the body . 
This is the scene north . 
They just removed a burnt body , or half a body from here . 
I do n't think there was anything left from his abdominal down . 
This is blood . 
And you know , you walk , and you hear the pieces of skin . 
And that 's it , that 's all that 's left . 
I remember giving three IVs , bandaging several wounded . 
Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall , shaking and screaming . 
Medics who were terrified and could n't perform . 
I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji . 
They can work on the post for pennies , but ca n't die there . 
They 've got to die outside . 
If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment , I would 've slit his throat right there . 
21:00 hours , and it 's just our squad going through today 's events in our heads , whether we want to or not . 
News Anchor : More violence in Iraq . 
Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of Baghdad . 
SP : We made the news . 
I feel exploited and proud at the same time . 
I 've lost all faith in the media -- a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of . 
I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass . 
I 'll do that , then I 'm gon na jerk off . 
Because these pages smell like Linds , and there wo n't be any time for jerking off tomorrow . 
Another mission at 06:00 . 
DS : Now -- -- thanks . 
When I said earlier , to try and tell a story from the inside out , versus the outside in -- part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding . 
It 's a new way of trying to make a documentary . 
When I met the guys , and 10 of them agreed to take cameras -- in total , 21 ended up filming . 
Five soldiers filmed the entire time . 
There are three featured in the film . 
The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email , and in it , attached a photo of that burned body out at the car . 
And the tone from the email was , you know , it had been a very bad day , obviously . 
And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base . 
So , I pinged Mike and I said , " Mike , can you please go get that interview with Pink ? " 
Because the thing that very often is missing is , in the military what they call " hot wash . " 
It 's that immediate interview after something immediately happens , you know . 
And if you let time go by , it kind of softens and smooths the edges . 
And for me , I really wanted that . 
So , in order to get the intimacy , to share that experience with you , the guys -- the two most popular mounts -- there was a camera on the turret , the gun turret , and then on the dashboard of the Humvee . 
Most of the Humvees , we ended up mounting two cameras in them . 
So you get to experience that in real time , right ? 
The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did within 24 hours of that episode happening . 
Steve Pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home . 
I knew about that journal , but it was very , very private . 
And you know , you earn someone 's trust , especially in doc filmmaking , through your relationship . 
So , it was n't until five months after he was home that he would read that journal . 
Now , the news footage I put in there to try to show -- you know , I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have . 
But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times , American soldiers saying , " Why do n't they talk about the good stuff that we do ? " 
OK , this is a perfect example . 
Pink 's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire . 
They did n't have to go outside the wire . 
There were not Americans hurt out there . 
They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives -- the Iraqis who work on the post . 
So , when you may hear soldiers complaining , that 's what they 're talking about , you know ? 
And I think it 's such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging . 
And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&As , and people are really opinionated . 
But it seems like people do n't want to hear so much , or listen , or try to have an exchange . 
And I 'm as fiery as the next person , but I really think -- you know , different speakers have talked about their concern for the world , and my concern is that we have to have these conversations . 
And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may , you know , we think we know . 
But we just have to leave that little bit of openness , to know . 
There 's such a disconnect . 
And for me , it 's trying to bridge that disconnect . 
I 'll share one story . 
I get -- I 'm often asked , you know , for me , what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film . 
And at screenings , inevitably -- you know , as I 'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff -- usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions . 
And usually , the first questions are , " Oh , what kind of cameras did you use ? " 
Or you know , these things . 
But there 's always a few guys , almost always , who are the last ones . 
And I 've learned over time that those are always the soldiers . 
And they wait until pretty much everybody 's gone . 
And for me , one of the most profound stories someone shared with me , that then became my story , was -- for those of you who have n't seen the film , and it 's not a spoiler -- it 's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents , where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed . 
In this film , there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed . 
A soldier came up to me and stood , you know really , pretty close , a foot away from me . 
He 's a big guy . 
And he looked at me , and I smiled , and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes . 
And he was n't going to blink . 
And he said , " My gunner was throwing candy . " 
And I knew what he was going to say . 
The gunner was throwing candy . 
They used to throw candy to the kids . 
Kids got too close , very often . 
And he said , " I killed a child . 
And I 'm a father . I have children . 
I have n't been able to tell my wife . 
I 'm afraid she 's going to think I 'm a monster . " 
I hugged him , of course , and I said , you know , " It 's going to be OK . " 
And he said , " I 'm going to bring her to see your film . 
And then I 'm going to tell her . " 
So when I talk about a disconnect , it 's not only for maybe those people who do n't know a soldier , which there obviously are . You know , these days , it 's not like World War II , where there was a war front and a home front , and everybody seemed involved . 
You can go for days here and not feel like there 's a war going on . 
And often , I 'll hear people say , who maybe know that I did this film , and they say , " Oh , you know , I 'm against the war , but I support the soldiers . " 
And I 've started to ask them , " Well , that 's nice . What are you doing ? 
Are you volunteering at a VA ? 
You go and see anybody ? 
Do you , if you find out your neighbor 's been , do you spend some time ? 
Not necessarily ask questions , but see if they want to talk ? 
Do you give money to any of the charities ? " 
You know , obviously , like Dean Kamen 's working on that amazing thing , but there 's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers . 
I think , I challenge us to say -- to operationalize those terms , when we say we support someone , you know ? 
Are you a friend to them ? 
Do you really care ? 
And I would just say it 's my hope , and I would ask you guys to please , you know , reach out a hand . 
And really do give them a hug . 
Thank you .

Kevin Surace suggests we rethink basic construction materials -- such as the familiar wallboard -- to reduce the huge carbon footprint generated by the manufacturing and construction of our buildings . He introduces EcoRock , a clean , recyclable and energy - efficient drywall created by his team at Serious Materials .

Kevin Surace invents eco - friendly drywall 
What 's happening to the climate ? 
It is unbelievably bad . 
This is , obviously , that famous view now of the Arctic , which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years . Very , very , very scary . 
So we all look at what we can do . 
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2 , 52 percent are tied to buildings . 
Only nine percent is passenger cars , interestingly enough . 
So we ran off to a sushi bar . 
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea . 
And it was something called EcoRock . 
And we said we could redesign the 115-year - old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of CO2 a year . 
So it was a big idea . We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent , which is exactly what we 've done . 
We started R&D in 2006 . 
Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing . 
There is the inside of our lab . We have n't shown this before . 
But our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right , to hit our targets . 
And they worked absolutely very , very , very hard . 
So then we went forward and built our production line in China . 
We do n't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S. , unfortunately . 
We did the line install over the summer . 
We started right there , with absolutely nothing . 
You 're seeing for the first time , a brand new drywall production line , not made using gypsum at all . 
That 's the finished production line there . 
We got our first panel out on December third . 
That is the slurry being poured onto paper , basically . That 's the line running . 
The exciting thing is , look at the faces of the people . 
These are people who worked this project for two to three years . 
And they are so excited . That 's the first board off the line . 
Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board . Obviously very , very excited . 
But this has a huge , huge impact on the environment . 
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that , had a great signing ceremony , leading to people hopefully using these products across the world . 
And we 've got Cradle - to - Cradle Gold on this thing . 
We happened to win , just recently , the Green Product of the Year for " The Re - Invention of Drywall , " from Popular Science . 
Thank you . Thank you . 
So here is what we learned : 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house . 
You probably had no idea . It 's like driving around the world six times . 
We must change everything . 
Look around the room : chairs , wood , everything around us has to change or we 're not going to lick this problem . 
Do n't listen to the people who say you ca n't do this , because anyone can . 
And these job losses , we can fix them with green - collar jobs . 
We 've got four plants . We 're building this stuff around the country . 
We 're going as fast as we can . 
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum , you know , CO2 generated . Right ? 
So what will you do ? I 'll tell you what I did and why I did it . And I know my time 's up . 
Those are my kids , Natalie and David . 
When they have their kids , 2050 , they 'd better look back at Grandpa and say , " Hey , you gave it a good shot . You did the best you could with the team that you had . " 
So my hope is that when you leave TED , you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it . 
And if you do n't know how , please find me -- I will help you . 
Last but not least , Bill Gates , I know you invented Windows . 
Wait till you see , maybe next year , what kind of windows we 've invented . 
Thank you so much . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/yoav_medan_ultrasound_surgery_healing_without_cuts.html 
Imagine having a surgery with no knives involved . At TEDMED , Yoav Medan shares a technique that uses MRI to find trouble spots and focused ultrasound to treat such issues as brain lesions , uterine fibroids and several kinds of cancerous growths .

Yoav Medan : Ultrasound surgery -- healing without cuts 
Over the last 13 years -- one , three , 13 years -- I 've been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel and partners around the world for taking this idea , this concept , noninvasive surgery , from the research lab to routine clinical use . 
And this is what I 'll tell you about . 
13 years -- for some of you , you can empathize with that number . 
For me , today , on this date , it 's like a second bar mitzvah experience . 
So this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies . 
One is the focused ultrasound , and the other one is the vision - enabled magnetic resonance imaging . 
So let 's first talk about focused ultrasound . 
And I hold in my hand a tissue - mimicking phantom . 
It is made out of silicon . 
It is transparent , made just for you . 
So you see , it 's all intact , completely transparent . 
I 'll take you now to the acoustic lab . 
You see the phantom within the aquarium . 
This is a setup I put in a physics lab . 
On the right - hand side , you see an ultrasonic transducer . 
So the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom . 
Okay , when you hear the click , this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom . 
Okay , so everything around it is whole and intact . 
It 's just a lesion formed inside . 
So think about , this is in your brain . 
We need to reach a target inside the brain . 
We can do it without harming any tissue . 
So this is , I think , the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system . 
Okay , so let 's talk a little bit about ultrasound , the force of ultrasound . 
You know all about imaging , right , ultrasound imaging . 
And you know also about lithotripsy -- breaking kidney stones . 
But ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between , because it 's a mechanical force . 
Basically , it 's a force acting on a tissue that it transverses . 
So you can change the intensity , the frequency , the duration , the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush to a hammer . 
And I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing , physically focusing . 
So this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all . 
When I was born , this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the Fry brothers and Lars Leksell , who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife . 
But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain , noninvasively , with focused ultrasound in the ' 50s . 
He failed , so he then invented the gammaknife . 
And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed . 
And there was something fundamental that they were missing . 
They were missing the vision . 
It was n't until the invention of the MR and really the integration of MR with focused ultrasound that we could get the feedback -- both the anatomical and the physiological in order to have a completely noninvasive , closed - loop surgical procedure . 
So this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today . 
This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system . 
And I will give you several examples . 
So the first one is in the brain . 
One of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders , like Parkinson 's or essential tremor . 
What is typical to those conditions , to essential tremor for example , is inability to drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything all over you , or write legibly so people can understand it , and be really independent in your life without the help of others . 
So I 'd like you to meet John . 
John is a retired professor of history from Virginia . 
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years . 
And medication did n't help him anymore . 
And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain . 
And about four or five months ago , he underwent an experimental procedure . 
It is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus . 
And this is his handwriting . 
" On June 20th , " if you can read it , " 2011 . " 
This is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the MR So now I 'll take you through [ what ] a typical procedure like that looks like , [ what ] noninvasive surgery looks like . 
So we put the patient on the MR table . 
We attach a transducer , in this case , to the brain , but if it will be a different organ , it will be a different transducer attached to the patient . 
And the physician will then take a regular MR scan . 
And the objective of that ? 
I do n't have a pointer here , but you see the green , sort of rectangle or trapezoid ? 
This is the sort of general area of the treatment . 
It 's a safety boundary around the target . 
It 's a target in the thalamus . 
So once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on , he selects basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is -- and he presses this blue button called " sonicate . " 
We call this instance of injecting the energy , we call it sonication . 
The only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse . 
This is the only device he needs in this treatment . 
So he presses " sonicate , " and this is what happens . 
You see the transducer , the light blue . 
There 's water in between the skull and the transducer . 
And it does this burst of energy . 
It elevates the temperature . 
We first need to verify that we are on target . 
So the first sonication is at lower energy . 
It does n't do any damage , but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees . 
And one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the MR is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively . 
This is really a unique capability of the MR . 
It is not being used in regular diagnostic imaging . 
But here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time . 
And you can see the points there on the graph . 
The temperature was raised to 43 degrees C temporarily . 
This does n't cause any damage . 
But the point is we are right on target . 
So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen , then we move to perform a full - energy ablation like you see here . 
And you see the temperature rises to like 55 to 60 degrees C. 
If you do it for more than a second , it 's enough to basically destroy the proteins of the cells . 
This is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment . 
This is an immediate relief . 
Thank you . 
John is one of [ about ] a dozen very heroic , courageous people who volunteered for the study . 
And you have to understand what is in people 's mind when they are willing to take the risk . 
And this is a quote from John after he wrote it . 
He said , " Miraculous . " 
And his wife said , " This is the happiest moment of my life . " 
And you wonder why . 
I mean , one of the messages I like to carry over is , what about defending quality of life ? 
I mean , those people lose their independence . 
They are dependent on others . 
And John today is fully independent . 
He returned to a normal life routine . 
And he also plays golf , like you do in Virginia when you are retired . 
Okay , so you can see here the spot . 
It 's like three millimeters in the middle of the brain . 
There 's no damage outside . 
He suffers from no neurodeficit . 
There 's no recovery needed , no nothing . 
He 's back to his normal life . 
Let 's move now to a more painful subject . 
Pain is something that can make your life miserable . 
And people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain , lower - back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases , when the metastases get to your bones , sometimes they are very painful . 
All those I 've indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by focused ultrasound relieving the pain , again , very fast . 
And I would like to tell you about PJ . 
He 's a 78 year - old farmer who suffered from -- how should I say it ? -- it 's called pain in the butt . 
He had metastases in his right buttock , and he could n't sit even with medication . 
He had to forgo all the farm activities . 
He was treated with radiation therapy , state - of - the - art radiation therapy , but it did n't help . 
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy . 
And again , he volunteered to a pivotal study that we ran worldwide , also in the U.S. 
And his wife actually took him . 
They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital . 
He had to sit on a cushion , stand still , not move , because it was very painful . 
He took the treatment , and on the way back , he drove the truck by himself . 
So again , this is an immediate relief . 
And you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens . 
He returned again to his daily routine on the farm . 
He rides his tractor . 
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly . 
And he has been very happy . 
But now , you ask me , but what about war , the war on cancer ? 
Show us some primary cancer . 
What can be done there ? 
So I have good news and bad news . 
The good news : there 's a lot that can be done . 
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S. 
And doing that in the U.S. 
is very painful . 
I do n't see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen . 
And it 's not just because of regulation ; it 's because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence - based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen . 
So the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer . 
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound . 
And we have better - than - surgery results in breasts . 
But I have a message for the men here . 
We heard here yesterday Quyen talking about the adverse event trait in prostate cancer . 
There is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by MR , because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy -- treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland , and by that , avoiding all the issues with potency and incontinence . 
Well , there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen -- quite lethal , very lethal actually -- pancreas , liver , kidney . 
The challenge there with a breathing and awake patient -- and in all our treatments , the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician -- is you have to teach the MR some tricks how to do it in real time . 
And this will take time . 
This will take two years . 
But I have now a message to the ladies . 
And this is , in 2004 , the FDA has approved MR - guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids . 
Women suffer from that disease . 
All those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods , abdominal pressure , back pain , frequent urination . 
And sometimes , they can not even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid . 
This is Frances . 
She was diagnosed with a grapefruit - sized fibroid . 
This is a big fibroid . 
She was offered a hysterectomy , but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option . 
So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in 2008 . 
And in 2010 , she became a first - time mother to a healthy baby . 
So new life was born . 
So in conclusion , I 'd like to leave you with actually four messages . 
One is , think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery , and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large -- and I think also from their physicians , by the way . 
And the other thing I would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table [ who ] is awake and can even monitor the treatment . 
In all our treatments , the patient holds a stop sonication button . 
He can stop the surgery at any moment . 
And with that note , I would like to thank you for listening .

Johanna Blakley : Lessons from fashion 's free culture 
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada . 
She 's an Italian fashion designer . 
She goes to this vintage store in Paris with a friend of hers . 
She 's rooting around , she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga -- she loves it . 
She 's turning it inside out . 
She 's looking at the seams . She 's looking at the construction . 
Her friend says , " Buy it already . " 
She said , " I 'll buy it , but I 'm also going to replicate it . " 
Now , the academics in this audience may think , " Well , that sounds like plagiarism . " 
But to a fashionista , what it really is is a sign of Prada 's genius : that she can root through the history of fashion and pick the one jacket that does n't need to be changed by one iota , and to be current and to be now . 
You might also be asking whether it 's possible that this is illegal for her to do this . 
Well , it turns out that it 's actually not illegal . 
In the fashion industry , there 's very little intellectual property protection . 
They have trademark protection , but no copyright protection and no patent protection to speak of . 
All they have , really , is trademark protection , and so it means that anybody could copy any garment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design . 
The only thing that they ca n't copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel . 
That 's one reason that you see logos splattered all over these products . 
It 's because it 's a lot harder for knock - off artists to knock off these designs because they ca n't knock off the logo . 
But if you go to Santee Alley , yeah . 
Well , yeah . 
Canal Street , I know . 
And sometimes these are fun , right ? 
Now , the reason for this , the reason that the fashion industry does n't have any copyright protection is because the courts decided long ago that apparel is too utilitarian to qualify for copyright protection . 
They did n't want a handful of designers owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing . 
And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve because Joe Blow owns it . 
But too utilitarian ? I mean is that the way you think of fashion ? 
This is Vivienne Westwood . No ! 
We think of it as maybe too silly , too unnecessary . 
Now , those of you who are familiar with the logic behind copyright protection -- which is that without ownership , there is no incentive to innovate -- might be really surprised by both the critical success of the fashion industry and the economic success of this industry . 
What I 'm going to argue today is that because there 's no copyright protection in the fashion industry , fashion designers have actually been able to elevate utilitarian design , things to cover our naked bodies , into something that we consider art . 
Because there 's no copyright protection in this industry , there 's a very open and creative ecology of creativity . 
Unlike their creative brothers and sisters , who are sculptors or photographers or filmmakers or musicians , fashion designers can sample from all their peers ' designs . 
They can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design . 
They 're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist . 
And here , I suspect , they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar . 
Maybe just a little . 
Ca n't copyright a costume either . 
Now , fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry . 
This wedding dress here is actually made of sporks , and this dress is actually made of aluminum . 
I 've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes as they walk through . 
So , one of the magical side effects of having a culture of copying , which is really what it is , is the establishment of trends . 
People think this is a magical thing . How does it happen ? 
Well , it 's because it 's legal for people to copy one another . 
Some people believe that there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain who sort of dictate to us what we 're all going to wear , but if you talk to any designer at any level , including these high - end designers , they always say their main inspiration comes from the street : where people like you and me remix and match our own fashion looks . 
And that 's where they really get a lot of their creative inspiration , so it 's both a top - down and a bottom - up kind of industry . 
Now , the fast fashion giants have probably benefited the most from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry . 
They are notorious for knocking off high - end designs and selling them at very low prices . 
And they 've been faced with a lot of lawsuits , but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers . 
The courts have said over and over again , " You do n't need any more intellectual property protection . " 
When you look at copies like this , you wonder : How do the luxury high - end brands remain in business ? 
If you can get it for 200 bucks , why pay a thousand ? 
Well , that 's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago . 
We invited Tom Ford to come -- the conference was called , " Ready to Share : Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity " -- and we asked him exactly this question . 
Here 's what he had to say . 
He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci , in case you did n't know . 
Tom Ford : And we found after much research that -- actually not much research , quite simple research -- that the counterfeit customer was not our customer . 
Johanna Blakley : Imagine that . 
The people on Santee Alley are not the ones who shop at Gucci . 
This is a very different demographic . 
And , you know , a knock - off is never the same as an original high - end design , at least in terms of the materials ; they 're always made of cheaper materials . 
But even sometimes a cheaper version can actually have some charming aspects , can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend . 
There 's lots of virtues of copying . 
One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to is that we now have a much broader palette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before , and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry , actually . 
And this is a good thing . We need lots of options . 
Fashion , whether you like it or not , helps you project who you are to the world . 
Because of fast fashion , global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to . 
And this , actually , is good news to trendsetters ; they want trends to be set so that they can move product . 
For fashionistas , they want to stay ahead of the curve . 
They do n't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing . 
And so , they want to move on to the next trend as soon as possible . 
I tell you , there is no rest for the fashionable . 
Every season , these designers have to struggle to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody 's going to love . 
And this , let me tell you , is very good for the bottom line . 
Now of course , there 's a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process . 
And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer . 
He has complained a lot about people copying him , but in one interview I read , he said it has really forced him to up his game . 
He had to come up with new ideas , new things that would be hard to copy . 
He came up with this Bowden - wedge heel that has to be made out of steel or titanium ; if you make it from some sort of cheaper material , it 'll actually crack in two . 
It forced him to be a little more innovative . 
And that actually reminded me of jazz great , Charlie Parker . 
I do n't know if you 've heard this anecdote , but I have . 
He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop was that he was pretty sure that white musicians would n't be able to replicate the sound . 
He wanted to make it too difficult to copy , and that 's what fashion designers are doing all the time . 
They 're trying to put together a signature look , an aesthetic that reflects who they are . 
When people knock it off , everybody knows because they 've put that look out on the runway , and it 's a coherent aesthetic . 
I love these Gallianos . 
Okay , we 'll move on . 
This is not unlike the world of comedy . 
I do n't know if you know that jokes also ca n't be copyright protected . 
So when one - liners were really popular , everybody stole them from one another . 
But now , we have a different kind of comic . 
They develop a persona , a signature style , much like fashion designers . 
And their jokes , much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer , really only work within that aesthetic . 
If somebody steals a joke from Larry David , for instance , it 's not as funny . 
Now , the other thing that fashion designers have done to survive in this culture of copying is they 've learned how to copy themselves . 
They knock themselves off . 
They make deals with the fast fashion giants and they come up with a way to sell their product to a whole new demographic : the Santee Alley demographic . 
Now , some fashion designers will say , " It 's only in the United States that we do n't have any respect . 
In other countries there is protection for our artful designs . " 
But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world , it turns out that the protection that 's offered is really ineffectual . 
In Japan , for instance , which I think is the third largest market , they have a design law ; it protects apparel , but the novelty standard is so high , you have to prove that your garment has never existed before , it 's totally unique . 
And that 's sort of like the novelty standard for a U.S. patent , which fashion designers never get -- rarely get here in the states . 
In the European Union , they went in the other direction . 
Very low novelty standard , anybody can register anything . 
But even though it 's the home of the fast fashion industry and you have a lot of luxury designers there , they do n't register their garments , generally , and there 's not a lot of litigation . 
It turns out it 's because the novelty standard is too low . 
A person can come in and take somebody else 's gown , cut off three inches from the bottom , go to the E.U. and register it as a new , original design . 
So , that does not stop the knock - off artists . 
If you look at the registry , actually , a lot of the registered things in the E.U. 
are Nike T - shirts that are almost identical to one another . 
But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg . 
She is the head of the Council of Fashion Designers of America , and she has told her constituency that she is going to get copyright protection for fashion designs . 
The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though . 
I do n't think the legislation is going anywhere , because they realized it is so hard to tell the difference between a pirated design and something that 's just part of a global trend . 
Who owns a look ? 
That is a very difficult question to answer . 
It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time , and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive . 
You know , it 's not just the fashion industry that does n't have copyright protection . 
There 's a bunch of other industries that do n't have copyright protection , including the food industry . 
You can not copyright a recipe because it 's a set of instructions , it 's fact , and you can not copyright the look and feel of even the most unique dish . 
Same with automobiles . 
It does n't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look , you can not copyright the sculptural design . 
It 's a utilitarian article , that 's why . 
Same with furniture , it 's too utilitarian . 
Magic tricks , I think they 're instructions , sort of like recipes : no copyright protection . 
Hairdos , no copyright protection . 
Open source software , these guys decided they did n't want copyright protection . 
They thought it 'd be more innovative without it . 
It 's really hard to get copyright for databases . 
Tattoo artists , they do n't want it ; it 's not cool . 
They share their designs . 
Jokes , no copyright protection . 
Fireworks displays , the rules of games , the smell of perfume : no . 
And some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you , but these are the gross sales for low I.P. industries , industries with very little copyright protection , and there 's the gross sales of films and books . 
It ai n't pretty . 
So you talk to people in the fashion industry and they 're like , " Shhh ! 
Do n't tell anybody we can actually steal from each other 's designs . 
It 's embarrassing . " 
But you know what ? It 's revolutionary , and it 's a model that a lot of other industries -- like the ones we just saw with the really small bars -- they might have to think about this . 
Because right now , those industries with a lot of copyright protection are operating in an atmosphere where it 's as if they do n't have any protection , and they do n't know what to do . 
When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries that did n't have copyright protection , I thought , " What exactly is the underlying logic ? 
I want a picture . " And the lawyers do not provide a picture , so I made one . 
These are the two main sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law . 
It is more complex than this , but this will do . 
First : Is something an artistic object ? 
Then it deserves protection . 
Is it a utilitarian object ? 
Then no , it does not deserve protection . 
This is a difficult , unstable binary . 
The other one is : Is it an idea ? 
Is it something that needs to freely circulate in a free society ? 
No protection . 
Or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea : something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it ? 
The problem is that digital technology has completely subverted the logic of this physically fixed , expression versus idea concept . 
Nowadays , we do n't really recognize a book as something that sits on our shelf or music as something that is a physical object that we can hold . 
It 's a digital file . 
It is barely tethered to any sort of physical reality in our minds . 
And these things , because we can copy and transmit them so easily , actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects . 
Now , the conceptual issues are truly profound when you talk about creativity and ownership and , let me tell you , we do n't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out . 
They 're smart . 
I 'm with one . He 's my boyfriend , he 's okay . 
He 's smart , he 's smart . 
But you want an interdisciplinary team of people hashing this out , trying to figure out : What is the kind of ownership model , in a digital world , that 's going to lead to the most innovation ? 
And my suggestion is that fashion might be a really good place to start looking for a model for creative industries in the future .

Rachel Sussman : The world 's oldest living things 
This strange - looking plant is called the Llareta . 
What looks like moss covering rocks is actually a shrub comprised of thousands of branches , each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end and so densely packed together that you could actually stand on top of it . 
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile , and it happens to be 3,000 years old . 
It also happens to be a relative of parsley . 
For the past five years , I 've been researching , working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are 2,000 years old and older . 
The project is part art and part science . 
There 's an environmental component . 
And I 'm also trying to create a means in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time and to start to consider a deeper timescale . 
I selected 2,000 years as my minimum age because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero and work backward from there . 
What you 're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi , living on the remote island of Yakushima . 
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project . 
I 'd been traveling in Japan without an agenda other than to photograph , and then I heard about this tree that is 2,180 years old and knew that I had to go visit it . 
It was n't until later , when I was actually back home in New York that I got the idea for the project . 
So it was the slow churn , if you will . 
I think it was my longstanding desire to bring together my interest in art , science and philosophy that allowed me to be ready when the proverbial light bulb went on . 
So I started researching , and to my surprise , this project had never been done before in the arts or the sciences . 
And -- perhaps naively -- I was surprised to find that there is n't even an area in the sciences that deals with this idea of global species longevity . 
So what you 're looking at here is the rhizocarpon geographicum , or map lichen , and this is around 3,000 years old and lives in Greenland , which is a long way to go for some lichens . 
Visiting Greenland was more like traveling back in time than just traveling very far north . 
It was very primal and more remote than anything I 'd ever experienced before . 
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences . 
One was when I had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord , only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found . 
And it 's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e - mail , so I was literally left to my own devices . 
But luckily , it worked out obviously , but it was a humbling experience to feel so disconnected . 
And then a few days later , we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream near our campsite , where the fish were so abundant that you could literally reach into the stream and grab out a foot - long trout with your bare hands . 
It was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet . 
And then , of course , there 's the lichens . 
These lichens grow only one centimeter every hundred years . 
I think that really puts human lifespans into a different perspective . 
And what you 're looking at here is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon . 
And if the title " Searching for Armillaria Death Rings , " sounds ominous , it is . 
The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus , killing certain species of trees in the forest . 
It 's also more benignly known as the honey mushroom or the " humongous fungus " because it happens to be one of the world 's largest organisms as well . 
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus , I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings , the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees . 
So I 'm not sure if there are any in this photo , but I do know the fungus is down there . 
And then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree . 
So that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus , and what it 's doing -- it 's actually slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients . 
So this strategy has served it pretty well -- it 's 2,400 years old . 
And then from underground to underwater . 
This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago that 's around 2,000 years old . 
And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one . 
This is at about 60 feet or 18 meters , depth . 
And you 'll see , there 's some damage to the surface of the coral . 
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish that had started eating it , though luckily , they lost interest before killing it . 
Luckily still , it seems to be out of harm 's way of the recent oil spill . 
But that being said , we just as easily could have lost one of the oldest living things on the planet , and the full impact of that disaster is still yet to be seen . 
Now this is something that I think is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet . 
This is clonal colony of Quaking Aspen trees , living in Utah , that is literally 80,000 years old . 
What looks like a forest is actually only one tree . 
Imagine that it 's one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system . 
So what you have is one giant , interconnected , genetically identical individual that 's been living for 80,000 years . 
It also happens to be male and , in theory immortal . 
This is a clonal tree as well . 
This is the spruce Gran Picea , which at 9,550 years is a mere babe in the woods . 
The location of this tree is actually kept secret for its own protection . 
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree , and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center is most likely a product of climate change . 
As it 's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain , the vegetation zone is actually changing . 
So we do n't even necessarily have to have direct contact with these organisms to have a very real impact on them . 
This is the Fortingall Yew -- no , I 'm just kidding -- this is the Fortingall Yew . 
But I put that slide in there because I 'm often asked if there are any animals in the project . 
And aside from coral , the answer is no . 
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is -- any guesses ? 
Rachel Sussman : 300 ? No , 175 is the oldest living tortoise , so nowhere near 2,000 . 
And then , you might have heard of this giant clam that was discovered off the coast of northern Iceland that reached 405 years old . 
However , it died in the lab as they were determining its age . 
The most interesting discovery of late , I think is the so - called immortal jellyfish , which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity . 
So that being said , it 's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild . 
And back to the yew here . 
So as you can see , it 's in a churchyard ; it 's in Scotland . It 's behind a protective wall . 
And there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the U.K. , but if you do the math , you 'll remember it 's actually the yew trees that were there first , then the churches . 
And now down to another part of the world . 
I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa with an expert in Baobab trees . 
And we saw a number of them , and this is most likely the oldest . 
It 's around 2,000 , and it 's called the Sagole Baobab . 
And you know , I think of all of these organisms as palimpsests . 
They contain thousands of years of their own histories within themselves , and they also contain records of natural and human events . 
And the Baobabs in particular are a great example of this . 
You can see that this one has names carved into its trunk , but it also records some natural events . 
So the Baobabs , as they get older , tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out . 
And this can create great natural shelters for animals , but they 've also been appropriated for some rather dubious human uses , including a bar , a prison and even a toilet inside of a tree . 
And this brings me to another favorite of mine -- I think , because it is just so unusual . 
This plant is called the Welwitschia , and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola , where it 's uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea . 
And what 's more , it 's actually a tree . 
It 's a primitive conifer . 
You 'll notice that it 's bearing cones down the center . 
And what looks like two big heaps of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get shredded up by the harsh desert conditions over time . 
And it actually never sheds those leaves , so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom . 
I spoke to a biologist at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown to ask him where he thought this remarkable plant came from , and his thought was that if you travel around Namibia , you see that there are a number of petrified forests , and the logs are all -- the logs are all giant coniferous trees , and yet there 's no sign of where they might have come from . 
So his thought was that flooding in the north of Africa actually brought those coniferous trees down tens of thousands of years ago , and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation to this unique desert environment . 
This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things . 
This is something called an underground forest . 
So , I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden , who explained that certain species of trees have adapted to this region . 
It 's bushfelt region , which is dry and prone to a lot of fires , as so what these trees have done is , if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree , and that this is ground level , imagine that the whole thing , that whole bulk of the tree , migrated underground , and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface . 
That way , when a fire roars through , it 's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed . 
The tree can easily recover . 
These also tend to grow clonally , the oldest of which is 13,000 years old . 
Back in the U.S. , there 's a couple plants of similar age . 
This is the clonal Creosote bush , which is around 12,000 years old . 
If you 've been in the American West , you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous , but that being said , you see that this has this unique , circular form . 
And what 's happening is it 's expanding slowly outwards from that original shape . 
And it 's one -- again , that interconnected root system , making it one genetically identical individual . 
It also has a friend nearby -- well , I think they 're friends . 
This is the clonal Mojave yucca , it 's about a mile away , and it 's a little bit older than 12,000 years . 
And you see it has that similar circular form . 
And there 's some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it . 
And both of these , the yucca and the Creosote bush , live on Bureau of Land Management land , and that 's very different from being protected in a national park . 
In fact , this land is designated for recreational all - terrain vehicle use . 
So , now I want to show what very well might be the oldest living thing on the planet . 
This is Siberian Actinobacteria , which is between 400,000 and 600,000 years old . 
This bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planetary biologists hoping to find clues to life on other planets by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours . 
And what they found , by doing research into the permafrost , was this bacteria . 
But what 's unique about it is that it 's doing DNA repair below freezing . 
And what that means is that it 's not dormant -- it 's actually been living and growing for half a million years . 
It 's also probably one the most vulnerable of the oldest living things , because if the permafrost melts , it wo n't survive . 
This is a map that I 've put together of the oldest living things , so you can get a sense of where they are ; you see they 're all over the world . 
The blue flags represent things that I 've already photographed , and the reds are places that I 'm still trying to get to . 
You 'll see also , there 's a flag on Antarctica . 
I 'm trying to travel there to find 5,000 year - old moss , which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula . 
So , I probably have about two more years left on this project -- on this phase of the project , but after five years , I really feel like I know what 's at the heart of this work . 
The oldest living things in the world are a record and celebration of our past , a call to action in the present and a barometer of our future . 
They 've survived for millennia in desert , in the permafrost , at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean . 
They 've withstood untold natural perils and human encroachments , but now some of them are in jeopardy , and they ca n't just get up and get out of the way . 
It 's my hope that , by going to find these organisms , that I can help draw attention to their remarkable resilience and help play a part in insuring their continued longevity into the foreseeable future . 
Thank you .

Jacqueline Novogratz : Inspiring a life of immersion 
I 've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days , talking to groups of students and professionals , and everywhere I 'm finding that I hear similar themes . 
On the one hand , people say , " The time for change is now . " 
They want to be part of it . 
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning . 
But on the other hand , I hear people talking about fear , a sense of risk - aversion . 
They say , " I really want to follow a life of purpose , but I do n't know where to start . 
I do n't want to disappoint my family or friends . " 
I work in global poverty . 
And they say , " I want to work in global poverty , but what will it mean about my career ? 
Will I be marginalized ? 
Will I not make enough money ? 
Will I never get married or have children ? " 
And as a woman who did n't get married until I was a lot older -- and I 'm glad I waited -- -- and has no children , I look at these young people and I say , " Your job is not to be perfect . 
Your job is only to be human . 
And nothing important happens in life without a cost . " 
These conversations really reflect what 's happening at the national and international level . 
Our leaders and ourselves want everything , but we do n't talk about the costs . 
We do n't talk about the sacrifice . 
One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen , the great American writer from the South . 
In a short story called " Oh Yes , " she talks about a white woman in the 1950s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl , and she looks at her child with a sense of pride , but she also wonders , what price will she pay ? 
" Better immersion than to live untouched . " 
But the real question is , what is the cost of not daring ? 
What is the cost of not trying ? 
I 've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion . 
One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok . 
She was a leader of the Menominee tribe , a Native American peoples . 
And when we would gather as fellows , she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions . 
And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future , looking at them from the Earth , and they would look at them , holding them as stewards for that future . 
Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other , not only as human beings , but to every living thing on the planet . 
And tragically , in 1999 , when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people , focused on preserving their culture and language , she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC . 
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that , we would leave a chair empty for her spirit . 
And more than a decade later , when I talk to NGO fellows , whether in Trenton , New Jersey or the office of the White House , and we talk about Ingrid , they all say that they 're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life 's mission . 
And when we think about legacy , I can think of no more powerful one , despite how short her life was . 
And I 've been touched by Cambodian women -- beautiful women , women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia . 
And I met them in the early ' 90s . 
In the 1970s , under the Pol Pot regime , the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people , and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals , the artists , the dancers . 
And at the end of the war , there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living . 
And the women , who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors , told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps . 
They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance , hoping that others were alive and doing the same . 
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage , her hands at her side , and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war and how extraordinary it was . 
And these big tears fell down her face , but she never lifted her hands to move them . 
And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls , because they had grown too old already , but the next generation . 
And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands -- beautiful rhythms -- as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them , wearing these beautiful silk colors . 
And I thought , after all this atrocity , this is how human beings really pray . 
Because they 're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future . 
And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we can not measure . 
I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership . 
And I have learned that power , particularly in its absolute form , is an equal opportunity provider . 
In 1986 , I moved to Rwanda , and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country 's first microfinance bank . 
And one of the women was Agnes -- there on your extreme left -- she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda , and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda . 
We built this institution based on social justice , gender equity , this idea of empowering women . 
But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end . 
And though she had been part of building a liberal party , a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance , about three months before the genocide , she switched parties and joined the extremist party , Hutu Power , and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women . 
She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide . 
And I would visit her in the prisons , sitting side - by - side , knees touching , and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us , but that maybe it 's not monsters so much , but the broken parts of ourselves , sadnesses , secret shame , and that ultimately it 's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts , those fragments , if you will , and to make us look at other beings , human beings , as lesser than ourselves -- and in the extreme , to do terrible things . 
And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men . 
I 've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male . 
And so in a gathering where we 're focused on women , while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them , we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered , unable to provide . 
And that , when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job , no education , no possibility , well then it 's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun . 
Sometimes very small investments can release enormous , infinite potential that exists in all of us . 
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization , Suraj Sudhakar , has what we call moral imagination -- the ability to put yourself in another person 's shoes and lead from that perspective . 
And he 's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world , Kibera . 
And they 're incredible guys . 
And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums , and they 're reading many TED authors and liking it . 
And then they created a business plan competition . 
Then they decided that they would do TEDx 's . 
And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men . 
Alex , in some ways , said it best . 
He said , " We used to feel like nobodies , but now we feel like somebodies . " 
And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link . 
What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other . 
And the reason these young guys told me that they 're doing these TEDx 's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV , or at best , microfinance . 
And they wanted to celebrate what 's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare -- the photojournalists and the creatives , the graffiti artists , the teachers and the entrepreneurs . 
And they 're doing it . 
And my hat 's off to you in Kibera . 
My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive . 
At Acumen Fund , we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital -- money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity , but as full - bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions . 
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years , and when we get it back , we invest in other innovations that focus on change . 
I know it works . 
We 've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies , and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars into these forgotten markets . 
This year alone , they 've delivered 40 million services like maternal health care and housing , emergency services , solar energy , so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems . 
Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions , easy categories , because we do n't see profit as a blunt instrument . 
But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit . 
And ultimately , we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact , measuring what is most important to us . 
And my dream is we 'll have a world one day where we do n't just honor those who take money and make more money from it , but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways . 
And it 's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change . 
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side - by - side -- one based on violence and the other on transcendence . 
I happened to be in Lahore , Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers . 
And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists do n't believe are fully Muslim . 
And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives , but they did more , because they created more hatred , more rage , more fear and certainly despair . 
But less than 24 hours , I was 13 miles away from those mosques , visiting one of our Acumen investees , an incredible man , Jawad Aslam , who dares to live a life of immersion . 
Born and raised in Baltimore , he studied real estate , worked in commercial real estate , and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference . 
For two years , he hardly made any money , a tiny stipend , but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui . 
And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital , but he continued to pay a price . 
He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes . 
It took almost two years just to register the land . 
But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person 's action . 
Today , 2,000 people live in 300 houses in this beautiful community . 
And there 's schools and clinics and shops . 
But there 's only one mosque . 
And so I asked Jawad , " How do you guys navigate ? This is a really diverse community . 
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays ? " 
He said , " Long story . 
It was hard , it was a difficult road , but ultimately the leaders of the community came together , realizing we only have each other . 
And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams , and those imams would take turns , they would rotate who would say Friday prayer . 
But the whole community , all the different sects , including Shi'a and Sunni , would sit together and pray . " 
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds . 
We face huge issues as a world -- the financial crisis , global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness . 
And every day we have a choice . 
We can take the easier road , the more cynical road , which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was , a fear of each other , distancing and blame . 
Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation , transcendence , compassion and love , but also accountability and justice . 
I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles , who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States . 
And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six - year - old girl named Ruby Bridges , the first child to desegregate schools in the South -- in this case , New Orleans . 
And he said that every day this six - year - old , dressed in her beautiful dress , would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily , calling her a monster , threatening to poison her -- distorted faces . 
And every day he would watch her , and it looked like she was talking to the people . 
And he would say , " Ruby , what are you saying ? " 
And she 'd say , " I 'm not talking . " 
And finally he said , " Ruby , I see that you 're talking . 
What are you saying ? " 
And she said , " Dr. Coles , I am not talking ; I 'm praying . " 
And he said , " Well , what are you praying ? " 
And she said , " I 'm praying , ' Father , forgive them , for they know not what they are doing . ' " At age six , this child was living a life of immersion , and her family paid a price for it . 
But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education . 
My final story is about a young , beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga , who was another Acumen Fund fellow , who hails from Uganda , a farming community . 
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya , just 200 miles away . 
And he said to me at the end of his year , " Jacqueline , it was so humbling , because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture . 
But especially when I was talking to the African women , I sometimes made these mistakes -- it was so hard for me to learn how to listen . " 
And he said , " So I conclude that , in many ways , leadership is like a panicle of rice . 
Because at the height of the season , at the height of its powers , it 's beautiful , it 's green , it nourishes the world , it reaches to the heavens . " 
And he said , " But right before the harvest , it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came . " 
We need leaders . 
We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can , ourselves , extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man , woman and child on this planet . 
And we need to have the humility to recognize that we can not do it alone . 
Robert Kennedy once said that " few of us have the greatness to bend history itself , but each of us can work to change a small portion of events . " 
And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written . 
Our lives are so short , and our time on this planet is so precious , and all we have is each other . 
So may each of you live lives of immersion . 
They wo n't necessarily be easy lives , but in the end , it is all that will sustain us . 
Thank you .

Siegfried Woldhek shows how he found the true face of Leonardo 
Good morning . 
Let 's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all , Leonardo da Vinci . 
We 're all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings , his paintings , his inventions , his writings . 
But we do not know his face . 
Thousands of books have been written about him , but there 's controversy , and it remains , about his looks . 
Even this well - known portrait is not accepted by many art historians . 
So , what do you think ? 
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or is n't it ? 
Let 's find out . 
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him . 
He drew people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , water , everything . 
But no faces ? 
I find that hard to believe . 
His contemporaries made faces , like the ones you see here -- en face or three - quarters . 
So , surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self - portraits from time to time . 
So let 's try to find them . 
I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self - portraits , we would find his face looking at us . 
So I looked at all of his drawings , more than 700 , and looked for male portraits . 
There are about 120 , you see them here . 
Which ones of these could be self - portraits ? 
Well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three - quarters . 
So we can eliminate all the profiles . 
It also has to be sufficiently detailed . 
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized . 
And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome , even beautiful man . 
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures . 
And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill . 
And here they are . 
Yes , indeed , the old man is there , as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus . 
And lastly , the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted , " The Musician . " 
Before we go into these faces , I should explain why I have some right to talk about them . 
I 've made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers , over the course of 300 -- 30 years , sorry , 30 years only . 
But there are 1,100 , and very few artists have drawn so many faces . 
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces . 
OK , now let 's look at these three portraits . 
And hold onto your seats , because if we zoom in on those faces , remark how they have the same broad forehead , the horizontal eyebrows , the long nose , the curved lips and the small , well - developed chin . 
I could n't believe my eyes when I first saw that . 
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike . 
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self - portrait , and look , they are very similar . 
Now , are they made in the right order ? 
The young man should be made first . 
And as you see here from the years that they were created , it is indeed the case . 
They are made in the right order . 
What was the age of Leonardo at the time ? Does that fit ? 
Yes , it does . He was 33 , 38 and 63 when these were made . 
So we have three pictures , potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time . 
But how do we know it 's him , and not someone else ? 
Well , we need a reference . 
And here 's the only picture of Leonardo that 's widely accepted . 
It 's a statue made by Verrocchio , of David , for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15 . 
And if we now compare the face of the statue , with the face of the musician , you see the very same features again . 
The statue is the reference , and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces . 
Ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published . 
It 's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first . 
The icon of icons finally has a face . 
Here he is : Leonardo da Vinci .

Michael Merzenich on re - wiring the brain 
This machine , which we all have residing in our skulls , reminds me of an aphorism , of a comment of Woody Allen to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull . 
And it 's this machine . 
And it 's constructed for change . It 's all about change . 
It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we ca n't do today , things today that we could n't do yesterday . 
And of course it 's born stupid . 
The last time you were in the presence of a baby -- this happens to be my granddaughter , Mitra . 
Is n't she fabulous ? 
But nonetheless when she popped out despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing in its development for several months before on the basis of her experiences in the womb -- nonetheless she had very limited abilities , as does every infant at the time of normal , natural full - term birth . 
If we were to assay her perceptual abilities , they would be crude . 
There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on . 
In fact there is little evidence that there is any cognitive ability in a very young infant . 
Infants do n't respond to much . 
There is not really much of an indication in fact that there is a person on board . 
And they can only in a very primitive way , and in a very limited way control their movements . 
It would be several months before this infant could do something as simple as reach out and grasp under voluntary control an object and retrieve it , usually to the mouth . 
And it will be some months beforeward , and we see a long steady progression of the evolution from the first wiggles , to rolling over , and sitting up , and crawling , standing , walking , before we get to that magical point in which we can motate in the world . 
And yet , when we look forward in the brain we see really remarkable advance . 
By this age the brain can actually store . 
It has stored , recorded , can fastly retrieve the meanings of thousands , tens of thousands of objects , actions , and their relationships in the world . 
And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands , potentially millions of ways . 
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities . 
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills . 
This brain is very much a thinking machine . 
And by this age there is absolutely no question that this brain , it has a person on board . 
And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self - development . 
And by this age we see a remarkable evolution in its capacity to control movement . 
Now movement has advanced to the point where it can actually control movement simultaneously , in a complex sequence , in complex ways as would be required for example for playing a complicated game , like soccer . 
Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head . 
And where this boy comes from , Sao Paulo , Brazil , about 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability . 
You could go out into the community in Monterey , and you 'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability . 
And if you did he 'd probably be from Sao Paulo . 
That 's all another way of saying that our individual skills and abilities are very much shaped by our environments . 
That environment extends into our contemporary culture , the thing our brain is challenged with . 
Because what we 've done in our personal evolutions is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities that are specific to our own individual histories . 
And in fact they result in a wonderful differentiation in humankind , in the way that , in fact , no two of us are quite alike . 
Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities that all derive out of the plasticity , the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine . 
In an adult brain of course we 've built up a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities that we can perform more or less automatically from memory , and that define us as acting , moving , thinking creatures . 
Now we study this , as the nerdy , laboratory , university - based scientists that we are , by engaging the brains of animals like rats , or monkeys , or of this particularly curious creature -- one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth -- to engage them in learning new skills and abilities . 
And we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired . 
In fact we do this in individuals of any age , in these different species -- that is to say from infancies , infancy up to adulthood and old age . 
So we might engage a rat , for example , to acquire a new skill or ability that might involve the rat using its paw to master particular manual grasp behaviors just like we might examine a child and their ability to acquire the sub - skills , or the general overall skill of accomplishing something like mastering the ability to read . 
Or you might look in an older individual who has mastered a complex set of abilities that might relate to reading musical notation or performing the mechanical acts of performance that apply to musical performance . 
From these studies we defined two great epochs of the plastic history of the brain . 
The first great epoch is commonly called the " Critical Period . " 
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up in its initial form its basic processing machinery . 
This is actually a period of dramatic change in which it does n't take learning , per se , to drive the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain . 
All it takes for example in the sound domain , is exposure to sound . 
And the brain actually is at the mercy of the sound environment in which it is reared . 
So for example I can rear an animal in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound , a repertoire of sound that I make up , that I make , just by exposure , artificially important to the animal and its young brain . 
And what I see is that the animal 's brain sets up its initial processing of that sound in a form that 's idealized , within the limits of its processing achievements to represent it in an organized and orderly way . 
The sound does n't have to be valuable to the animal : I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable , like the sounds that simulate the sounds of a native language of a child . 
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized -- specialized for that complex array , a repertoire of sounds . 
It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation , in multi - dimensional neuronal representational terms . 
Or I can expose the animal to a completely meaningless and destructive sound . 
I can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan , in the presence of continuous noise . 
And when I do that I actually specialize the brain to be a master processor for that meaningless sound . 
And I frustrate its ability to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence . 
Such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies . 
And they account for , for example the beautiful evolution of a language - specific processor in every normally developing baby . 
And so they also account for development of defective processing in a substantial population of children who are more limited , as a consequence , in their language abilities at an older age . 
Now in this early period of plasticity the brain actually changes outside of a learning context . 
I do n't have to be paying attention to what I hear . 
The input does n't really have to be meaningful . 
I do n't have to be in a behavioral context . 
This is required so the brain sets up it 's processing so that it can act differentially , so that it can act selectively , so that the creature that wears it , that carries it , can begin to operate on it in a selective way . 
In the next great epoch of life , which applies for most of life , the brain is actually refining its machinery as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities . 
And in this epoch , which extends from late in the first year of life to death ; it 's actually doing this under behavioral control . 
And that 's another way of saying the brain has strategies that define the significance of the input to the brain . 
And it 's focusing on skill after skill , or ability after ability , under specific attentional control . 
It 's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior . 
This is actually very powerful . 
This lifelong capacity for plasticity , for brain change , is powerfully expressed . 
It is the basis of our real differentiation , one individual from another . 
You can look down in the brain of an animal that 's engaged in a specific skill , and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels . 
So here is a very simple experiment . 
It was actually conducted about five years ago in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence in Marseilles . 
It 's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool that 's equivalent in its difficulty to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon . 
The monkey actually mastered the task in about 700 practice tries . 
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all . 
It had a success rate of about one in eight tries . 
Those tries were elaborate . 
Each attempt was substantially different from the other . 
But the monkey gradually developed a strategy . 
And 700 or so tries later the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails . 
He 's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time . 
At this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped way : very beautifully regulated and highly repeated , trial to trial . 
We can look down in the brain of the monkey . 
And we see that it 's distorted . 
We can track these changes , and have tracked these changes in many such behaviors across time . 
And here we see the distortion reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey . 
Now this is a map , down in the surface of the brain , in which , in a very elaborate experiment we 've reconstructed the responses , location by location , in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons . 
We see here a reconstruction of how the hand is represented in the brain . 
We 've actually distorted the map by the exercise . 
And that is indicated in the pink . We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger . 
These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool . 
If we look at the selectivity of responses in the cortex of the monkey , we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged . 
In other words there is still a single , simple representation of the fingertips in this most organized of cortical areas of the surface of the skin of the body . 
Monkey has like you have . 
And yet now it 's represented in substantially finer grain . 
The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces . 
And that is an unknown -- unsuspected , maybe , by you -- part of acquiring the skill or ability . 
Now actually we 've looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task . 
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific to the skill or ability . 
So for example we can look to the cortical area that represents input that 's controlling the posture of the monkey . 
We look in cortical areas that control specific movements , and the sequences of movements that are required in the behavior , and so forth . 
They are all remodeled . They all become specialized for the task at hand . 
There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically when you learn a simple skill like this . 
And that represents in your brain , really massive change . 
It represents the change in a reliable way of the responses of tens of millions , possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain . 
It represents changes of hundreds of millions , possibly billions of synaptic connections in your brain . 
This is constructed by physical change . 
And the level of construction that occurs is massive . 
Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general . 
Or acquiring their native language abilities . 
The changes are massive . 
What it 's all about is the selective representations of things that are important to the brain . 
Because in most of the life of the brain this is under control of behavioral context . 
It 's what you pay attention to . 
It 's what 's rewarding to you . 
It 's what the brain regards , itself , as positive and important to you . 
It 's all about cortical processing and forebrain specialization . 
And that underlies your specialization . 
That is why you , in your many skills and abilities , are a unique specialist : a specialist that 's vastly different in your physical brain in detail than the brain of an individual 100 years ago ; enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago . 
Now , one of the characteristics of this change process is that information is always related to other inputs or information that is occurring in immediate time , in context . 
And that 's because the brain is constructing representations of things that are correlated in little moments of time and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time . 
The brain is recording all information and driving all change in temporal context . 
Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context that 's occurred in your brain is you . 
Billions of events have occurred in your history that are related in time to yourself as the receiver , or yourself as the actor , yourself as the thinker , yourself as the mover . 
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in from the surface of your body that are always associated with you as the receiver , and that result in the embodiment of you . 
You are constructed , your self is constructed from these billions of events . 
It 's constructed . It 's created in your brain . 
And it 's created in the brain via physical change . 
This is a marvelously constructed thing that results in individual form because each one of us has vastly different histories , and vastly different experiences , that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self , of personhood . 
Now we 've used this research to try to understand not just how a normal person develops , and elaborates their skills and abilities , but also try to understand the origins of impairment , and the origins of differences or variations that might limit the capacities of a child , or an adult . 
I 'm going to talk about using these strategies to actually design brain plasticity - based approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child that increases the competence of the child as a language receiver and user and , thereafter , as a reader . 
And I 'm going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science , first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age . 
And then , by using it in a targeted approach we 're going to try to differentiate the machinery to recover function in old age . 
So the first example I 'm going to talk about relates to children with learning impairments . 
We now have a large body of literature that demonstrates that the fundamental problem that occurs in the majority of children that have early language impairments , and that are going to struggle to learn to read , is that their language processor is created in a defective form . 
And the reason that it rises in a defective form is because early in the baby 's brain 's life the machine process is noisy . 
It 's that simple . 
It 's a signal - to - noise problem . Okay ? 
And there are a lot of things that contribute to that . 
There are numerous inherited faults that could make the machine process noisier . 
Now I might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears . 
If any -- those of you who are older in the audience know that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate was born with what we called mental retardation . 
We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively ; we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities ; and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read . 
Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures . 
That 's disappeared . That no longer applies . 
That inherited weakness , that inherited condition has evaporated . 
We do n't hear about that anymore . Where did it go ? 
Well , it was understood by a Dutch surgeon , about 35 years ago , that if you simply fix the problem early enough , when the brain is still in this initial plastic period so it can set up this machinery adequately , in this initial set up time in the critical period , none of that happens . 
What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it ? 
You 're basically opening up the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears , which have had them reliably full . 
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled . 
It 's degraded . 
The child 's native language is such a case is not English . 
It 's not Japanese . 
It 's muffled English . It 's degraded Japanese . 
It 's crap . 
And the brain specializes for it . 
It creates a representation of language crap . 
And then the child is stuck with it . 
Now the crap does n't just happen in the ear . 
It can also happen in the brain . 
The brain itself can be noisy . It 's commonly noisy . 
There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier . 
And the native language for a child with such a brain is degraded . 
It 's not English . It 's noisy English . 
And that results in defective representations of sounds of words -- not normal -- a different strategy , by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants . 
And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants . 
They are about an order of magnitude longer , about 11 times longer in duration on average , than in a normal child . 
Space constants are about three times greater . 
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits in this domain . 
Of course they will . Because as a receiver of language , they are receiving it and representing it , and in information it 's representing crap . 
And they are going to have poor reading skills . 
Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds into this orthographic or visual representational form . 
If you do n't have a brain representation of word sounds that translation makes no sense . 
And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology . 
Then these children increasingly in evaluation after evaluation , in their operations in language , and their operations in reading -- we document that abnormal neurology . 
The point is is that you can train the brain out of this . 
A way to think about this is you can actually re - refine the processing capacity of the machinery by changing it . 
Changing it in detail . It takes about 30 hours on the average . 
And we 've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today . 
Actually , probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak . 
And actually when you look at the impacts , the impacts are substantial . 
So here we 're looking at the normal distribution . 
What we 're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution . 
This is from about 3,000 children . 
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution are moving into the middle or the right . 
This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities . 
This is like an IQ test for language . 
The impact in the distribution , if you trained every child in the United States , would be to shift the whole distribution to the right and narrow the distribution . 
This is a substantially large impact . 
Think of a classroom of children in the language arts . 
Think of the children on the slow side of the class . 
We have the potential to move most of those children to the middle or to the right side . 
In addition to accurate language training it also fixes memory and cognition speech fluency and speech production . 
And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training -- that is to say reading . 
And to a large extent it fixes the brain . 
You can look down in the brain of a child in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford , and MIT , and UCSF , and UCLA , and a number of other institutions . 
And children operating in various language behaviors , or in various reading behaviors , you see for the most extent , for most children , their neuronal responses , complexly abnormal before you start , are normalized by the training . 
Now you can also take the same approach to address problems in aging . 
Where again the machinery is deteriorating now from competent machinery , it 's going south . 
Noise is increasing in the brain . 
And learning modulation and control is deteriorating . 
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual and witness a change in the time constants and space constants with which , for example , the brain is representing language again . 
Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning , it 's going back into chaos in the end . 
This results in declines in memory in cognition , and in postural ability and agility . 
It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual -- this is a small population of such individuals -- train equally intensively for about 30 hours . 
These are 80- to 90-year - olds . 
And what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory , of their ability to remember things after a delay , of their ability to control their attention , their language abilities and visual - spatial abilities . 
The overall neuropsychological index of these trained individuals in this population is about two standard deviations . 
That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution , and I 'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities , the average person has moved to the middle or the right side of the distribution . 
It means that most people who are at risk for senility , more or less immediately , are now in a protected position . 
My issues are to try to get to rescuing older citizens more completely and in larger numbers , because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale -- and the same for kids . 
My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies . 
I 'm specifically interested in things like autism , and cerebral palsy , these great childhood catastrophes . 
And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism , and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia . 
Your issues as it relates to this science , is how to maintain your own high - functioning learning machine . 
And of course , a well - ordered life in which learning is a continuous part of it , is key . 
But also in your future is brain aerobics . 
Get ready for it . It 's going to be a part of every life not too far in the future , just like physical exercise is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period . 
The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this literature and the science that is important to you is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself . 
Now that you know , now that science is telling us that you are in charge , that it 's under your control , that your happiness , your well - being , your abilities , your capacities , are capable of continuous modification , continuous improvement , and you 're the responsible agent and party . 
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice . 
It will be a long time before they really understand it . 
Now that 's another issue and not my fault . 
Okay . Thank you .

When he realized his wife had to choose between buying family meals and buying her monthly " supplies , " Arunachalam Muruganantham vowed to help her solve the problem of the sanitary pad . His research got very very personal -- and led him to a powerful business model . 
Talks 
1614 
Arunachalam Muruganantham : How I started a sanitary napkin revolution ! 
So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife . 
It makes me to stand here , the fame , the money I got out of it . 
So what I did , I 'd gone back to my early marriage days . 
What you did in the early marriage days , you tried to impress your wife . I did the same . 
On that occasion , I found my wife carrying something like this . 
I saw . " What is that ? " I asked . 
My wife replied , " None of your business . " 
Then , being her husband , I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth . 
I do n't even use that cloth to clean my two - wheeler . 
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days . 
Then I immediately asked her , why are you [ using ] that unhygienic method ? 
She replied , I also know about [ sanitary pads ] , but myself and my sisters , if they start using that , we have to cut our family milk budget . 
Then I was shocked . What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget ? 
And it 's called affordability . 
I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads . 
I went to a local shop , I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet . 
That fellow looks left and right , and spreads a newspaper , rolls it into the newspaper , gives it to me like a banned item , something like that . 
I do n't know why . I did not ask for a condom . 
Then I took that pad . I want to see that . What is inside it ? 
The very first time , at the age of 29 , that day I am touching the sanitary pad , first ever . 
I must know : How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad ? 
They are not going to touch that , because it 's not your matter . 
Then I thought to myself , white substance , made of cotton -- oh my God , that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds , dollars . 
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife ? 
That 's how all this started , but after making a sanitary pad , where can I check it ? 
It 's not like I can just check it in the lab . 
I need a woman volunteer . Where can I get one in India ? 
Even in Bangalore you wo n't get [ one ] , in India . 
So only problem : the only available victim is my wife . 
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife 's name is Shanti . 
" Close your eyes . Whatever I give , it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring , even a chocolate , I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it . 
Close your eyes . " 
Because I tried to make it intimate . 
Because it 's an arranged marriage , not a love marriage . 
So one day she said , openly , I 'm not going to support this research . 
Then other victims , they got into my sisters . 
But even sisters , wives , they 're not ready to support in the research . 
That 's why I am always jealous with the saints in India . 
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them . 
Why I am not getting [ any ] ? 
You know , without them even calling , they 'll get a lot of women volunteers . 
Then I used , tried to use the medical college girls . 
They also refused . Finally , I decide , use sanitary pad myself . 
Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon . 
Armstrong . Then Tenzing Hillary , in Everest , like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe . 
I wore a sanitary pad . I filled animal blood in a football bottle , I tied it up here , there is a tube going into my panties , while I 'm walking , while I 'm cycling , I made a press , doses of blood will go there . 
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect . That five days I 'll never forget -- the messy days , the lousy days , that wetness . 
My God , it 's unbelievable . 
But here the problem is , one company is making napkin out of cotton . It is working well . 
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton . It 's not working . 
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research . 
You need first funds . 
Not only financial crises , but because of the sanitary pad research , I come through all sorts of problems , including a divorce notice from my wife . 
Why is this ? I used medical college girls . 
She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls . 
Finally , I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood , but even after that , you need a multimillion - dollar plant like this to process that material . Again , a stop - up . 
Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools , a simple machine tool like this . 
In this machine , any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant , anyone can make a world - class napkin at your dining hall . 
That is my invention . 
So after that , what I did , usually if anyone got a patent or an invention , immediately you want to make , convert into this . 
I never did this . I dropped it just like this , because you do this , if anyone runs after money , their life will not [ have ] any beauty . It is boredom . 
A lot of people making a lot of money , billion , billions of dollars accumulating . 
Why are they coming for , finally , for philanthropy ? 
Why the need for accumulating money , then doing philanthropy ? 
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ? 
That 's why I am giving this machine only in rural India , for rural women , because in India , [ you 'll be ] surprised , only two percent of women are using sanitary pads . The rest , they 're using a rag cloth , a leaf , husk , [ saw ] dust , everything except sanitary pads . 
It is the same in the 21st century . That 's why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India . 
So far , 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries . 
Now I 'm on my seventh year sustaining against multinational , transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark . 
A school dropout from Coimbatore , how he is able to sustaining ? 
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs . 
Play video one . 
Arunachalam Muruganantham : The thing I saw in my wife 's hand , " Why are you using that nasty cloth ? " 
She replied immediately , " I know about napkins , but if I start using napkins , then we have to cut our family milk budget . " 
Why not make myself a low - cost napkin ? 
So I decided I 'm going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups . 
That is my idea . 
AM : And previously , you need a multimillion investment for machine and all . Now , any rural woman can . 
They are performing puja . 
: You just think , competing giants , even from Harvard , Oxford , is difficult . 
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals . 
I 'm sustaining on seventh year . 
Already 600 installations . What is my mission ? 
I 'm going to make India [ into ] a 100-percent - sanitary - napkin - using country in my lifetime . 
In this way I 'm going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I 'm going to create . 
That 's why I 'm not running after this bloody money . 
I 'm doing something serious . 
If you chase a girl , the girl wo n't like you . 
Do your job simply , the girl will chase you . 
Like that , I never chased Mahalakshmi . 
Mahalakshmi is chasing me , I am keeping in the back pocket . 
Not in front pocket . I 'm a back pocket man . 
That 's all . A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad . 
I am becoming a solution provider . I 'm very happy . 
I do n't want to make this as a corporate entity . 
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe . That 's why I put all the details on public domain like an open software . 
Now 110 countries are accessing it . Okay ? 
So I classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated . 
Little educated , done this . Surplus educated , what are you going to do for the society ? 
Thank you very much . Bye !

Lewis Pugh swims the North Pole 
Today I want to talk to you about swimming across the North Pole , across the most northern place in the whole world . 
And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father . 
He was a great storyteller . 
He could tell a story about an event , and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment . 
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy was of the first British atomic bomb test . 
He had been there and watched it go off . 
And he said that the explosion was so loud and the light was so intense , that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes . 
And he said that he could actually see an x - ray of his fingers , because the light was so bright . 
And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off had a very , very big impact on my late father . 
Every holiday I had as a young boy was in a national park . 
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world , and show me just how fragile the world is . 
He also told me about the great explorers . 
He loved history . He would tell me about Captain Scott walking all the way to the South Pole and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest . 
And so ever since I think I was just six years old , I dreamed of going to the polar regions . 
I really , really wanted to go to the Arctic . 
There was something about that place which drew me to it . 
And , well , sometimes it takes a long time for a dream to come true . 
But seven years ago , I went to the Arctic for the first time . 
And it was so beautiful that I 've been back there ever since , for the last seven years . 
I love the place . 
But I have seen that place change beyond all description , just in that short period of time . 
I have seen polar bears walking across very , very thin ice in search of food . 
I have swum in front of glaciers which have retreated so much . 
And I have also , every year , seen less and less sea ice . 
And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there . 
In the two years before my swim , 23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover just melted away . 
And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders to get them to understand what is happening . 
So I decided to do this symbolic swim at the top of the world , in a place which should be frozen over , but which now is rapidly unfreezing . 
And the message was very clear : Climate change is for real , and we need to do something about it . 
And we need to do something about it right now . 
Well , swimming across the North Pole , it 's not an ordinary thing to do . 
I mean , just to put it in perspective , 27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool . 
This morning , the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees . 
The passengers who fell off the Titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade . 
Fresh water freezes at zero . 
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7 . 
It 's fucking freezing . 
I 'm sorry , but there is no other way to describe it . 
And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me to help me with this task . 
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations . 
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport , you just dive into the sea and off you go . 
It could n't be further from the truth for me . 
And I then went and did a huge amount of training , swimming in icy water , backwards and forwards . 
But the most important thing was to train my mind to prepare myself for what was going to happen . 
And I had to visualize the swim . 
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end . 
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth . 
I had to see my coach screaming for me , " Come on Lewis ! Come on ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Do n't slow down ! " 
And so I literally swam across the North Pole hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind . 
And then , after a year of training , I felt ready . 
I felt confident that I could actually do this swim . 
So myself and the five members of the team , we hitched a ride on an icebreaker which was going to the North Pole . 
And on day four , we decided to just do a quick five minute test swim . 
I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before , because it 's just impossible to train in those types of conditions . 
So we stopped the ship , as you do . 
We all got down onto the ice , and I then got into my swimming costume and I dived into the sea . 
I have never in my life felt anything like that moment . 
I could barely breathe . I was gasping for air . 
I was hyperventilating so much , and within seconds my hands were numb . 
And it was -- the paradox is that you 're in freezing cold water , but actually you 're on fire . 
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes . 
I remember just trying to get out of the water . 
I climbed out of the ice . 
And I remember taking the goggles off my face and looking down at my hands in sheer shock , because my fingers had swollen so much that they were like sausages . 
And they were swollen so much , I could n't even close them . 
What had happened is that we are made partially of water , and when water freezes it expands . 
And so what had actually happened is that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded . 
And they had burst . And I was in so much agony . 
I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower . 
And I remember standing underneath the hot shower and trying to defrost my fingers . 
And I thought , in two days ' time , I was going to do this swim across the North Pole . 
I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim , for one kilometer across the North Pole . 
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy with my father , was just going out the window . 
There is no possibility that this was going to happen . 
And I remember then getting out of the shower and realizing I could n't even feel my hands . 
And for a swimmer , you need to feel your hands because you need to be able to grab the water and pull it through with you . 
The next morning , I woke up and I was in such a state of depression , and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes . 
For those of you who do n't know him , he 's the great British explorer . 
A number of years ago , he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole . 
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea . 
And after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out . 
And his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to England . 
He went to a local hospital and there they said , " Ran , there is no possibility of us being able to save these fingers . 
We are going to actually have to take them off . " 
And Ran decided to go into his tool shed and take out a saw and do it himself . 
And all I could think of was , if that happened to Ran after three minutes , and I ca n't feel my hands after five minutes , what on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes ? 
At the very best , I 'm going to end up losing some fingers . 
And at worst , I did n't even want to think about it . 
We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole . 
And my close friend David , he saw the way I was thinking , and he came up to me and he said , " Lewis , I 've known you since you were 18 years old . 
I 've known you , and I know , Lewis , deep down , right deep down here , that you are going to make this swim . 
I so believe in you Lewis . I 've seen the way you 've been training . 
And I realize the reason why you 're going to do this . 
This is such an important swim . 
We stand at a very , very important moment in this history , and you 're going to make a symbolic swim here to try to shake the lapels of world leaders . 
Lewis , have the courage to go in there , because we are going to look after you every moment of it . " 
And I just , I got so much confidence from him saying that , because he knew me so well . 
So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole . 
And we stopped the ship , and it was just as the scientists had predicted . 
There were open patches of sea everywhere . 
And I went down into my cabin and I put on my swimming costume . 
And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor , which measures my core body temperature and my heart rate . 
And then we walked out onto the ice . 
And I remember looking into the ice , and there were big chunks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black . 
I had never seen black water before . 
And it is 4,200 meters deep . 
And I said to myself , " Lewis , do n't look left , do n't look right . 
Just scuttle forward and go for it . " 
And so I now want to show you a short video of what happened there on the ice . 
Narrator : We 're just sailing out of harbor now , and it 's at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally . 
Everything just looks so gray around here , and looks so cold . 
We 've just seen our first polar bears . 
It was absolutely magical . 
A mother and a cub , such a beautiful sight . 
And to think that in 30 , 40 years they could become extinct . 
It 's a very frightening , very , very frightening thought . 
We 're finally at the North Pole . This is months and months and months of dreaming to get here , years of training and planning and preparation . 
Ooh . In a couple of hours ' time I 'm going to get in here and do my swim . 
It 's all a little bit frightening , and emotional . 
Amundson , you ready ? Amudson : Ready . 
Lewis Pugh : Ten seconds to swim . Ten seconds to swim . 
Take the goggles off . Take the goggles off ! 
Man : Take the shoes . Take the shoes . 
Well done lad ! You did it ! You did it Lewis ! 
You did it ! You did it man ! 
LP : How on earth did we do that ? 
Man : Against the current ! You did it against the current ! 
LP : Thank you very much . Thank you very much . 
Thank you so much . 
Audience : Encore ! 
LP : I 'd just like to end off by just saying this : It took me four months again to feel my hands . 
But was it worth it ? Yes , absolutely it was . 
There are very , very few people who do n't know now about what is happening in the Arctic . 
And people ask me , " Lewis , what can we do about climate change ? " 
And I say to them , I think we need to do three things . 
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks . 
You saw during that video all those flags . 
Those flags represented the countries from which my team came from . 
And equally , when it comes to climate change , every single country is going to have to make cuts . 
Britain , America , Japan , South Africa , the Congo . 
All of us together , we 're all on the same ship together . 
The second thing we need to do is we need to just look back at how far we have come in such a short period of time . 
I remember , just a few years ago , speaking about climate change , and people heckling me in the back and saying it does n't even exist . 
I 've just come back from giving a series of speeches in some of the poorest townships in South Africa to young children as young as 10 years old . 
Four or five children sitting behind a desk , and even in those poorest conditions , they all have a very , very good grasp of climate change . 
We need to believe in ourselves . 
Now is the time to believe . 
We 've come a long way . We 're doing good . 
But the most important thing we must do is , I think , we must all walk to the end of our lives and turn around , and ask ourselves a most fundamental question . 
And that is , " What type of world do we want to live in , and what decision are we going to make today to ensure that we all live in a sustainable world ? " 
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very , very much .

As the world 's attention focuses on the perils of oil exploration , we present Richard Sears ' talk from early February 2010 . Sears , an expert in developing new energy resources , talks about our inevitable and necessary move away from oil . Toward ... what ?

Richard Sears : Planning for the end of oil 
For the next few minutes we 're going to talk about energy , and it 's going to be a bit of a varied talk . 
I 'll try to spin a story about energy , and oil 's a convenient starting place . 
The talk will be broadly about energy , but oil 's a good place to start . 
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff . 
You take about eight or so carbon atoms , about 20 hydrogen atoms , you put them together in exactly the right way and you get this marvelous liquid : very energy - dense and very easy to refine into a number of very useful products and fuels . 
It 's great stuff . 
Now , as far as it goes , there 's a lot of oil out there in the world . 
Here 's my little pocket map of where it 's all located . 
A bigger one for you to look at . 
But this is it , this is the oil in the world . 
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is . 
This is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today . 
Now , that 's just one story about oil , and we could end it there and say , " Well , oil 's going to last forever because , well , there 's just a lot of it . " 
But there 's actually more to the story than that . 
Oh , by the way , if you think you 're very far from some of this oil , 1000 meters below where you 're all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world . 
Come talk to me about it , I 'll fill in some of the details if you want . 
So , that 's one of the stories of oil ; there 's just a lot of it . 
But what about oil ? Where is it in the energy system ? 
Here 's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil , and it 's been a dominant part of our energy system for most of those 150 years . 
Now , here 's another little secret I 'm going to tell you about : For the last 25 years , oil has been playing less and less of a role in global energy systems . 
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985 , when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply . 
Now , it 's about 35 percent . 
It 's been declining and I believe it will continue to decline . 
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007 and is declining . 
So oil is playing a less significant role every year . 
And so , 25 years ago , there was a peak oil ; just like , in the 1920s , there was a peak coal ; and a hundred years before that , there was a peak wood . 
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems . 
And what 's been taking up the slack in the last few decades ? 
Well , a lot of natural gas and a little bit of nuclear , for starters . 
And what goes on in the future ? 
Well , I think out ahead of us a few decades is peak gas , and beyond that , peak renewables . 
Now , I 'll tell you another little , very important story about this picture . 
Now , I 'm not pretending that energy use in total is n't increasing , it is -- that 's another part of the story . Come talk to me about it , we 'll fill in some of the details -- but there 's a very important message here : This is 200 years of history , and for 200 years we 've been systematically decarbonizing our energy system . 
Energy systems of the world becoming progressively -- year on year , decade on decade , century on century -- becoming less carbon intense . 
And that continues into the future with the renewables that we 're developing today , reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy by mid century . 
Now that might be the end of the story -- Okay , we just replace it all with conventional renewables -- but I think , actually , there 's more to the story than that . 
And to tell the next part of the story -- and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond . 
What is the future of truly sustainable , carbon - free energy ? 
Well , we have to take a little excursion , and we 'll start in central Texas . 
Here 's a piece of limestone . 
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls , Texas . 
It 's about 400 million years old . 
And it 's just limestone , nothing really special about it . 
Now , here 's a piece of chalk . 
I picked this up at MIT . It 's a little younger . 
And it 's different than this limestone , you can see that . 
You would n't build a building out of this stuff , and you would n't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this . 
Yeah , it 's very different -- no , it 's not different . 
It 's not different , it 's the same stuff : calcium carbonate , calcium carbonate . 
What 's different is how the molecules are put together . 
Now , if you think that 's kind of neat , the story gets really neat right now . 
Off the coast of California comes this : It 's an abalone shell . 
Now , millions of abalone every year make this shell . 
Oh , by the way , just in case you were n't already guessing , it 's calcium carbonate . 
It 's the same stuff as this and the same stuff as this . 
But it 's not the same stuff ; it 's different . 
It 's thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tougher than this . 
And why ? Because the lowly abalone is able to lay down the calcium carbonate crystals in layers , making this beautiful , iridescent mother of pearl . 
Very specialized material that the abalone self - assembles , millions of abalone , all the time , every day , every year . 
This is pretty incredible stuff . 
All the same , what 's different ? 
How the molecules are put together . 
Now , what does this have to do with energy ? 
Here 's a piece of coal . 
And I 'll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk . 
Now , whether we 're talking about fuels or energy carriers , or perhaps novel materials for batteries or fuel cells , nature has n't ever built those perfect materials yet because nature did n't need to . 
Nature did n't need to because , unlike the abalone shell , the survival of a species did n't depend on building those materials , until maybe now when it might just matter . 
So , when we think about the future of energy , imagine what would it be like if instead of this , we could build the energy equivalent of this just by rearranging the molecules differently . 
And so that is my story . 
The oil will never run out . 
It 's not because we have a lot of it . 
It 's not because we 're going to build a bajillion windmills . 
It 's because , well , thousands of years ago , people invented ideas -- they had ideas , innovations , technology -- and the Stone Age ended , not because we ran out of stones . 
It 's ideas , it 's innovation , it 's technology that will end the age of oil , long before we run out of oil . 
Thank you very much .

Timothy Prestero thought he 'd designed the perfect incubator for newborns in the developing world -- but his team learned a hard lesson when it failed to go into production . A manifesto on the importance of designing for real - world use , rather than accolades .

Timothy Prestero : Design for people , not awards 
I 've got a great idea that 's going to change the world . 
It 's fantastic , it 's going to blow your mind . 
It 's my beautiful baby . 
Here 's the thing , everybody loves a beautiful baby . 
I mean , I was a beautiful baby . 
Here 's me and my dad a couple days after I was born . 
So in the world of product design , the beautiful baby 's like the concept car . 
It 's the knock - out . 
You see it and you go , " Oh , my God . I 'd buy that in a second ! " 
So why is it that this year 's new cars look pretty much exactly like last year 's new cars ? 
What went wrong between the design studio and the factory ? 
Today I do n't want to talk about beautiful babies , I want to talk about the awkward adolescence of design -- those sort of dorky teenage years where you 're trying to figure out how the world works . 
I 'm going to start with an example from some work that we did on newborn health . 
So here 's a problem : Four million babies around the world , mostly in developing countries , die every year before their first birthday , even before their first month of life . 
It turns out half of those kids , or about 1.8 million newborns around the world , would make it if you could just keep them warm for the first three days , maybe the first week . 
So this is a newborn intensive care unit in Kathmandu , Nepal . 
All of these kids in blankets belong in incubators -- something like this . So this is a donated Japanese Atom incubator that we found in [ unclear ] in Kathmandu . 
This is what we want . 
Probably what happened is a hospital in Japan upgraded their equipment and donated their old stuff to Nepal . 
The problem is , without technicians , without spare parts , donations like this very quickly turn into junk . 
So this seemed like a problem that we could do something about . 
Keeping a baby warm for a week , that 's not rocket science . 
So we got started . 
We partnered with a leading medical research institution here in Boston . 
We conducted months of user research overseas , trying to think like designers , human - centered design . 
Let 's figure out what people want . 
We killed thousands of Post - it notes . 
We made dozens of prototypes to get to this . 
So this is the NeoNurture Infant Incubator , and this has a lot of smarts built into it . And we felt great . 
So the idea here is , unlike the concept car , we want to marry something beautiful with something that actually works . 
And our idea is that this design would inspire manufacturers and other people of influence to take this model and run with it . 
Here 's the bad news : The only baby ever actually put inside the NeoNurture Incubator was this kid during a Time magazine photo shoot . 
So recognition is fantastic . 
We want design to get out for people to see it . 
It won lots of awards . 
But it felt like a booby prize . 
We wanted to make beautiful things that are going to make the world a better place , and I do n't think this kid was even in it long enough to get warm . 
So it turns out that design for inspiration does n't really -- I guess what I would say is , for us , for what I want to do , it 's either too slow or it just does n't work , it 's ineffective . 
So really I want to design for outcomes . 
I do n't want to make beautiful stuff . 
I want to make the world a better place . 
So when we were designing NeoNurture , we paid a lot of attention to the people who are going to use this thing -- for example , poor families , rural doctors , overloaded nurses , even repair technicians . 
We thought we had all our bases covered , we 'd done everything right . 
Well it turns out there 's this whole constellation of people who have to be involved in a product for it to be successful : manufacturing , financing , distribution , regulation . 
Michael Free at PATH says you have to figure out who will " choose , use and pay the dues " for a product like this . 
And I have to ask the question -- VC 's always ask , " Sir , what is your business , and who is your customer ? " 
Who is our customer ? Well here 's an example . 
This is a Bangladeshi hospital director outside his facility . 
It turns out he does n't buy any of his equipment . 
Those decisions are made by the Ministry of Health or by foreign donors , and it just kind of shows up . 
Similarly , here 's a multinational medical device manufacturer . 
It turns out they 've got to fish where the fish are . 
So it turns out that in emerging markets , where the fish are , are the emerging middle class of these countries -- diseases of affluence : heart disease , infertility . 
So it turns out that design for outcomes in one aspect really means thinking about design for manufacture and distribution . 
Okay , that was an important lesson . 
Second , we took that lesson and tried to push it into our next project . 
So we started by finding a manufacturer , an organization called MTTS in Vietnam , that manufactures newborn care technologies for Southeast Asia . 
Our other partner is East Meets West . 
This is an American foundation that distributes that technology to poor hospitals around that region . 
So we started with them saying , " Well what do you want ? 
What 's a problem you want to solve ? " 
And they said , " Well let 's work on newborn jaundice . " 
So this is another one of these mind - boggling global problems . 
So jaundice affects two - thirds of newborns around the world . 
Of those newborns , one in 10 roughly , if it 's not treated , the jaundice gets so severe that it leads to either a life - long disability , or the kids could even die . 
There 's one way to treat jaundice , and that 's what 's called an exchange transfusion . 
So as you can imagine , that 's expensive and a little bit dangerous . 
There is another cure . 
It 's very technological , it 's very complex , a little daunting . 
You 've got to shine blue light on the kid -- bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover . 
How is this a hard problem ? 
So I went to MIT , Okay , we 'll figure that out . 
So here 's an example . This is an overhead phototherapy device that 's designed for American hospitals . 
And here 's how it 's supposed to be used . 
So it 's over the baby , illuminating a single patient . 
Take it out of an American hospital , send it overseas to a crowded facility in Asia , here 's how it 's actually used . 
The effectiveness of phototherapy is a function of light intensity . 
So these dark blue squares show you where it 's effective phototherapy . 
Here 's what it looks like under actual use . 
So those kids on the edges are n't actually receiving effective phototherapy . 
But without training , without some kind of light meter , how would you know ? 
We see other examples of problems like this . 
So here 's a neonatal intensive care unit where moms come in to visit their babies . 
And keep in mind , Mom maybe just had a C - section , so that 's already kind of a bummer . 
Mom 's visiting her kid . 
She sees her baby naked , lying under some blue lights , looking kind of vulnerable . 
It 's not uncommon for Mom to put a blanket over the baby . 
From a phototherapy standpoint , maybe not the best behavior . 
In fact that sounds kind of dumb . 
Except , what we 've learned is that there 's no such thing as a dumb user -- really is what we 've learned . 
There are only dumb products . 
We have to think like existentialists . 
It 's not the painting we would have painted , it 's the painting that we actually painted . 
It 's the use -- designed for actual use . 
How are people actually going to use this ? 
So similarly , when we think about our partner MTTS , they 've made some amazing technologies for treating newborn illnesses . 
So here 's an overhead warmer and a CPAP . 
They 're inexpensive , really rugged . 
They 've treated 50,000 kids in Vietnam with this technology . 
But here 's the problem : Every doctor in the world , every hospital administrator , has seen TV -- curse those " E.R. " reruns . 
Turns out they all know what a medical device is supposed to look like . 
They want Buck Rogers , they do n't want effective . 
It sounds crazy , it sounds dumb , but there are actually hospitals who would rather have no equipment than something that looks cheap and crummy . 
So again , if we want people to trust a device , it has to look trustworthy . 
So thinking about outcomes , it turns out appearances matter . 
So we took all that information together . 
We tried , this time , to get it right . 
And here 's what we developed . 
So this is the Firefly Phototherapy Device , except this time we did n't stop at the concept car . 
So from the very beginning we started by talking to manufacturers . 
Our goal is to make a state - of - the - art product that our partner MTTS can actually manufacture . 
So our goal is to study how they work , the resources they have access to , so that they can make this product . 
So that 's the design for manufacture question . 
When we think about actual use , you 'll notice that Firefly has a single bassinet . 
It only fits a single baby . 
And the idea here is it 's obvious how you ought to use this device . 
If you try to put more than one kid in , you 're stacking them on top of each other . 
So the idea here is we say , you want to make it hard to use wrong . 
In other words , you want to make the right way to use it the easiest way to use it . 
Another example : Again , silly mom . 
Silly mom thinks her baby looks cold , wants to put a blanket over the baby . 
Well that 's why we have lights above and below the baby in Firefly . 
So if mom does put a blanket over the baby , it 's still receiving effective phototherapy from below . 
Last story here : I 've got a friend in India who told me that you have n't really tested a piece of electronic technology for distribution in Asia until you 've trained a cockroach to climb in and pee on every single little component on the inside . 
You think it 's funny . 
I had a laptop in the Peace Corps , and the screen had all these dead pixels on it . 
And one day I looked in , they were all dead ants that had gotten into my laptop and perished -- those poor ants ! 
So with Firefly , what we did is -- the problem is electronics get hot and you have to put in vents or fans to keep them cool -- in most products . 
We decided that I ca n't put a " do not enter " sign next to the vent . 
We actually got rid of all of that stuff . 
So Firefly 's totally sealed . 
These are the kinds of lessons -- as awkward as it was to be a pretty goofy teenager , much worse to be a frustrated designer . 
So I was thinking about , what I really want to do is change the world . 
I have to pay attention to manufacturing and distribution . 
I have to pay attention to how people are actually going to use a device . 
I actually have to pay attention . Really , there 's no excuse for failure . 
I have to think like an existentialist . 
I have to accept that there are no dumb users , that there 's only dumb products . 
We have to ask ourselves hard questions . 
Are we designing for the world that we want ? 
Are we designing for the world that we have ? 
Are we designing for the world that 's coming , whether we 're ready or not ? 
I got into this business designing products . 
I 've since learned that if you really want to make a difference in the world , you have to design outcomes . 
And that 's design that matters . 
Thank you .

Marc Pachter has conducted live interviews with some of the most intriguing characters in recent American history as part of a remarkable series created for the Smithsonian 's National Portrait Gallery . He reveals the secret to a great interview and shares extraordinary stories of talking with Steve Martin , Clare Booth Luce and more .

Marc Pachter : The art of the interview 
The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated to presenting great American lives , amazing people . 
And that 's what it 's about . 
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives , but that 's it . 
And so I 'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today . 
I 'm going to talk about a program I started there , which , from my point of view , is the proudest thing I did . 
I started to worry about the fact that a lot of people do n't get their portraits painted anymore , and they 're amazing people , and we want to deliver them to future generations . 
So , how do we do that ? 
And so I came up with the idea of the living self - portrait series . 
And the living self - portrait series was the idea of basically my being a brush in the hand of amazing people who would come and I would interview . 
And so what I 'm going to do is , not so much give you the great hits of that program , as to give you this whole notion of how you encounter people in that kind of situation , what you try to find out about them , and when people deliver and when they do n't and why . 
Now , I had two preconditions . 
One was that they be American . 
That 's just because , in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery , it 's created to look at American lives . 
That was easy , but then I made the decision , maybe arbitrary , that they needed to be people of a certain age , which at that point , when I created this program , seemed really old . 
Sixties , seventies , eighties and nineties . 
For obvious reasons , it does n't seem that old anymore to me . 
And why did I do that ? 
Well , for one thing , we 're a youth - obsessed culture . 
And I thought really what we need is an elders program to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk . 
But the second part of it -- and the older I get , the more convinced I am that that 's true . 
It 's amazing what people will say when they know how the story turned out . 
That 's the one advantage that older people have . 
Well , they have other , little bit of advantage , but they also have some disadvantages , but the one thing they or we have is that we 've reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out . 
So , we can then go back in our lives , if we 've got an interviewer who gets that , and begin to reflect on how we got there . 
All of those accidents that wound up creating the life narrative that we inherited . 
So , I thought okay , now , what is it going to take to make this work ? 
There are many kinds of interviews . We know them . 
There are the journalist interviews , which are the interrogation that is expected . 
This is somewhat against resistance and caginess on the part of the interviewee . 
Then there 's the celebrity interview , where it 's more important who 's asking the question than who answers . 
That 's Barbara Walters and others like that , and we like that . 
That 's Frost - Nixon , where Frost seems to be as important as Nixon in that process . 
Fair enough . 
But I wanted interviews that were different . 
I wanted to be , as I later thought of it , empathic , which is to say , to feel what they wanted to say and to be an agent of their self - revelation . 
By the way , this was always done in public . 
This was not an oral history program . 
This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual , and having me be the brush in their self - portrait . 
Now , it turns out that I was pretty good at that . 
I did n't know it coming into it . 
And the only reason I really know that is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright , and that was six months after he 'd had a stroke . 
And he had never appeared in public since that point . 
This was not a devastating stroke , but it did affect his speaking and so forth . 
And I thought it was worth a chance , he thought it was worth a chance , and so we got up on the stage , and we had an hour conversation about his life , and after that a woman rushed up to me , essentially did , and she said , " Where did you train as a doctor ? " 
And I said , " I have no training as a doctor . I never claimed that . " 
And she said , " Well , something very weird was happening . 
When he started a sentence , particularly in the early parts of the interview , and paused , you gave him the word , the bridge to get to the end of the sentence , and by the end of it , he was speaking complete sentences on his own . " 
I did n't know what was going on , but I was so part of the process of getting that out . 
So I thought , okay , fine , I 've got empathy , or empathy , at any rate , is what 's critical to this kind of interview . 
But then I began to think of other things . 
Who makes a great interview in this context ? 
It had nothing to do with their intellect , the quality of their intellect . 
Some of them were very brilliant , some of them were , you know , ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals , but it was never about that . 
It was about their energy . 
It 's energy that creates extraordinary interviews and extraordinary lives . 
I 'm convinced of it . 
And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young . 
These were people through their 90s . 
In fact , the first person I interviewed was George Abbott , who was 97 , and Abbott was filled with the life force -- I guess that 's the way I think about it -- filled with it . 
And so he filled the room , and we had an extraordinary conversation . 
He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do because he was famous for being silent , for never ever saying anything except maybe a word or two . 
And , in fact , he did wind up opening up -- by the way , his energy is evidenced in other ways . 
He subsequently got married again at 102 , so he , you know , he had a lot of the life force in him . 
But after the interview , I got a call , very gruff voice , from a woman . 
I did n't know who she was , and she said , " Did you get George Abbott to talk ? " 
And I said , " Yeah . Apparently I did . " 
And she said , " I 'm his old girlfriend , Maureen Stapleton , and I could never do it . " 
And then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that George Abbott actually could talk . 
So , you know , you want energy , you want the life force , but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing . 
The worst interviews that you can ever have are with people who are modest . 
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who 's modest , because all of these people have been assembled to listen to them , and they sit there and they say , " Aw , shucks , it was an accident . " 
There 's nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them . 
The worst interview I ever did : William L. Shirer . 
The journalist who did " The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich . " 
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months , and every time I 'd ask him about it , he 'd say , " Oh , I just happened to be there . 
Did n't matter . " Whatever . 
Awful . 
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person . 
They have to think that they did something and that they want to share it with you . 
But it comes down , in the end , to how do you get through all the barriers we have . 
All of us are public and private beings , and if all you 're going to get from the interviewee is their public self , there 's no point in it . 
It 's pre - programmed . It 's infomercial , and we all have infomercials about our lives . 
We know the great lines , we know the great moments , we know what we 're not going to share , and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody . 
This was n't -- and some of you will remember Mike Wallace 's old interviews -- tough , aggressive and so forth . They have their place . 
I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say , to break out of their own cocoon of the public self , and the more public they had been , the more entrenched that person , that outer person was . 
And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment that happened in this interview series . 
It all has to do with that shell that most of us have , and particularly certain people . 
There 's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce . 
It 'll be your generational determinant as to whether her name means much to you . 
She did so much . She was a playwright . 
She did an extraordinary play called " The Women . " 
She was a congresswoman when there were n't very many congresswomen . 
She was editor of Vanity Fair , one of the great phenomenal women of her day . 
And , incidentally , I call her the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right . 
She was sort of adored on the Right the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left . 
And , in fact , when we did the interview -- I did the living self - portrait with her -- there were three former directors of the CIA basically sitting at her feet , just enjoying her presence . 
And I thought , this is going to be a piece of cake , because I always have preliminary talks with these people for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes . 
We never talk before that because if you talk before , you do n't get it on the stage . 
So she and I had a delightful conversation . 
We were on the stage and then -- by the way , spectacular . 
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce 's look . 
She was in a great evening gown . 
She was 80 , almost that day of the interview , and there she was and there I was , and I just proceeded into the questions . 
And she stonewalled me . It was unbelievable . 
Anything that I would ask , she would turn around , dismiss , and I was basically up there -- any of you in the moderate - to - full entertainment world know what it is to die onstage . 
And I was dying . She was absolutely not giving me a thing . 
And I began to wonder what was going on , and you think while you talk , and basically , I thought , I got it . 
When we were alone , I was her audience . 
Now I 'm her competitor for the audience . 
That 's the problem here , and she 's fighting me for that , and so then I asked her a question -- I did n't know how I was going to get out of it -- I asked her a question about her days as a playwright , and again , characteristically , instead of saying , " Oh yes , I was a playwright , and this is what blah blah blah , " she said , " Oh , playwright . Everybody knows I was a playwright . 
Most people think that I was an actress . I was never an actress . " 
But I had n't asked that , and then she went off on a tear , and she said , " Oh , well , there was that one time that I was an actress . 
It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman , and I got up there , " and she went on and on , " And then I got on the stage . " 
And then she turned to me and said , " And you know what those young actors did ? 
They upstaged me . " And she said , " Do you know what that is ? " 
Just withering in her contempt . 
And I said , " I 'm learning . " 
And she looked at me , and it was like the successful arm - wrestle , and then , after that , she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like . 
I have to end that one . This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce . 
Again , a remarkable person . 
I 'm not politically attracted to her , but through her life force , I 'm attracted to her . 
And the way she died -- she had , toward the end , a brain tumor . 
That 's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine , and very few of us were invited to a dinner party . 
And she was in horrible pain . 
We all knew that . 
She stayed in her room . 
Everybody came . The butler passed around canapes . 
The usual sort of thing . 
Then at a certain moment , the door opened and she walked out perfectly dressed , completely composed . 
The public self , the beauty , the intellect , and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again . 
She wanted the control of her final moment , and she did it amazingly . 
Now , there are other ways that you get somebody to open up , and this is just a brief reference . 
It was n't this arm - wrestle , but it was a little surprising for the person involved . 
I interviewed Steve Martin . It was n't all that long ago . 
And we were sitting there , and almost toward the beginning of the interview , I turned to him and I said , " Steve , " or " Mr. Martin , it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods . 
Was yours unhappy ? " 
And he looked at me , you know , as if to say , " This is how you 're going to start this thing , right off ? " 
And then he turned to me , not stupidly , and he said , " What was your childhood like ? " 
And I said -- these are all arm wrestles , but they 're affectionate -- and I said , " My father was loving and supportive , which is why I 'm not funny . " 
And he looked at me , and then we heard the big sad story . 
His father was an SOB , and , in fact , he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood , but then we were off and running . 
So the question is : What is the key that 's going to allow this to proceed ? 
Now , these are arm wrestle questions , but I want to tell you about questions that are more related to empathy and that really , very often , are the questions that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked . 
And I 'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints . 
One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers . 
Again , some of you will know him , most of you wo n't , Dumas Malone . 
He did a five - volume biography of Thomas Jefferson , spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson , and by the way , at one point I asked him , " Would you like to have met him ? " 
And he said , " Well , of course , but actually , I know him better than anyone who ever met him , because I got to read all of his letters . " 
So , he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years . 
And I asked him one question . 
I said , " Did Jefferson ever disappoint you ? " 
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson and connecting with him , and he said , " Well ... " -- I 'm going to do a bad southern accent . 
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally . 
But he said , " Well , " he said , " I 'm afraid so . " 
He said , " You know , I 've read everything , and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit . " 
And he basically was saying that this was a man who lied more than he wished he had , because he saw the letters . 
He said , " But I understand that . " He said , " I understand that . " 
He said , " We southerners do like a smooth surface , so that there were times when he just did n't want the confrontation . " 
And he said , " Now , John Adams was too honest . " 
And he started to talk about that , and later on he invited me to his house , and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts , and he and she had exactly the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams . 
She was the New Englander and abrasive , and he was this courtly fellow . 
But really the most important question I ever asked , and most of the times when I talk about it , people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity , or cruelty , but I promise you it was the right question . 
This was to Agnes de Mille . 
Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history . 
She basically created the dances in " Oklahoma , " transforming the American theater . 
An amazing woman . 
At the time that I proposed to her that -- by the way , I would have proposed to her ; she was extraordinary -- but proposed to her that she come on . 
She said , " Come to my apartment . " 
She lived in New York . 
" Come to my apartment and we 'll talk for those 15 minutes , and then we 'll decide whether we proceed . " 
And so I showed up in this dark , rambling New York apartment , and she called out to me , and she was in bed . 
I had known that she had had a stroke , and that was some 10 years before . 
And so she spent almost all of her life in bed , but -- I speak of the life force -- her hair was askew . 
She was n't about to make up for this occasion . 
And she was sitting there surrounded by books , and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment was her will , which she had by her side . 
She was n't unhappy about this . She was resigned . 
She said , " I keep this will by my bed , memento mori , and I change it all the time just because I want to . " 
And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life . 
I thought , this is somebody I 've got to get in this series . 
She agreed . 
She came on . Of course she was wheelchaired on . 
Half of her body was stricken , the other half not . 
She was , of course , done up for the occasion , but this was a woman in great physical distress . 
And we had a conversation , and then I asked her this unthinkable question . 
I said , " Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful ? " 
And the audience just -- you know , they 're always on the side of the interviewee , and they felt that this was a kind of assault , but this was the question she had wanted somebody to ask her whole life . 
And she began to talk about her childhood , when she was beautiful , and she literally turned -- here she was , in this broken body -- and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth , and then she said , " And then puberty hit . " 
And she began to talk about things that had happened to her body and her face , and how she could no longer count on her beauty , and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one for whom all the ballet lessons were given . 
And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company , and in that process , she made a number of decisions . 
First of all , was that dance , even though it had n't been offered to her , was her life . 
And secondly , she had better be , although she did dance for a while , a choreographer because then her looks did n't matter . 
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real , real fact in her life . 
It was an amazing privilege to do this series . 
There were other moments like that , very few moments of silence . 
The key point was empathy because everybody in their lives is really waiting for people to ask them questions , so that they can be truthful about who they are and how they became what they are , and I commend that to you , even if you 're not doing interviews . 
Just be that way with your friends and particularly the older members of your family . 
Thank you very much .

Some of the world 's most baffling social problems , says Peter Eigen , can be traced to systematic , pervasive government corruption , hand - in - glove with global companies . At TEDxBerlin , Eigen describes the thrilling counter - attack led by his organization Transparency International .

Peter Eigen : How to expose the corrupt 
I am going to speak about corruption , but I would like to juxtapose two different things . 
One is the large global economy , the large globalized economy , and the other one is the small , and very limited , capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to govern , to shape , this economy . 
Because there is this asymmetry , which creates , basically , failing governance . 
Failing governance in many areas : in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment , in the area of exploitation of women and children , in the area of climate change , in all the areas in which we really need a capacity to reintroduce the primacy of politics into the economy , which is operating in a worldwide arena . 
And I think corruption , and the fight against corruption , and the impact of corruption , is probably one of the most interesting ways to illustrate what I mean with this failure of governance . 
Let me talk about my own experience . 
I used to work as the director of the World Bank office in Nairobi for East Africa . 
At that time , I noticed that corruption , that grand corruption , that systematic corruption , was undermining everything we were trying to do . 
And therefore , I began to not only try to protect the work of the World Bank , our own projects , our own programs against corruption , but in general , I thought , " We need a system to protect the people in this part of the world from the ravages of corruption . " 
And as soon as I started this work , I received a memorandum from the World Bank , from the legal department first , in which they said , " You are not allowed to do this . 
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries . 
This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank , so I want you to stop your doings . " 
In the meantime , I was chairing donor meetings , for instance , in which the various donors , and many of them like to be in Nairobi -- it is true , it is one of the unsafest cities of the world , but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable . 
And in these donor meetings , I noticed that many of the worst projects -- which were put forward by our clients , by the governments , by promoters , many of them representing suppliers from the North -- that the worst projects were realized first . 
Let me give you an example : a huge power project , 300 million dollars , to be built smack into one of the most vulnerable , and one of the most beautiful , areas of western Kenya . 
And we all noticed immediately that this project had no economic benefits : It had no clients , nobody would buy the electricity there , nobody was interested in irrigation projects . 
To the contrary , we knew that this project would destroy the environment : It would destroy riparian forests , which were the basis for the survival of nomadic groups , the Samburu and the Turkana in this area . 
So everybody knew this is a , not a useless project , this is an absolute damaging , a terrible project -- not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country for these hundreds of millions of dollars , and the siphoning off of the scarce resources of the economy from much more important activities like schools , like hospitals and so on . 
And yet , we all rejected this project , none of the donors was willing to have their name connected with it , and it was the first project to be implemented . 
The good projects , which we as a donor community would take under our wings , they took years , you know , you had too many studies , and very often they did n't succeed . 
But these bad projects , which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy for many generations , for the environment , for thousands of families who had to be resettled -- they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks , of supplier agencies , of insurance agencies -- like in Germany , Hermes , and so on -- and they came back very , very quickly , driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the North . 
Now , these suppliers were our big companies . 
They were the actors of this global market , which I mentioned in the beginning . 
They were the Siemenses of this world , coming from France , from the UK , from Japan , from Canada , from Germany , and they were systematically driven by systematic , large - scale corruption . 
We are not talking about 50,000 dollars here , or 100,000 dollars there , or one million dollars there . 
No , we are talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the Swiss bank accounts , on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein , of the president 's ministers , the high officials in the para - statal sectors . 
This was the reality which I saw , and not only one project like that : I saw , I would say , over the years I worked in Africa , I saw hundreds of projects like this . 
And so , I became convinced that it is this systematic corruption which is perverting economic policy - making in these countries , which is the main reason for the misery , for the poverty , for the conflicts , for the violence , for the desperation in many of these countries . 
That we have today more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line , that we have more than a billion people without proper drinking water in the world , twice that number , more than two billion people without sanitation and so on , and the consequent illnesses of mothers and children , still , child mortality of more than 10 million people every year , children dying before they are five years old : The cause of this is , to a large extent , grand corruption . 
Now , why did the World Bank not let me do this work ? 
I found out afterwards , after I left , under a big fight , the World Bank . 
The reason was that the members of the World Bank thought that foreign bribery was okay , including Germany . 
In Germany , foreign bribery was allowed . 
It was even tax - deductible . 
No wonder that most of the most important international operators in Germany , but also in France and the UK and Scandinavia , everywhere , systematically bribed . 
Not all of them , but most of them . 
And this is the phenomenon which I call failing governance , because when I then came to Germany and started this little NGO here in Berlin , at the Villa Borsig , we were told , " You can not stop our German exporters from bribing , because we will lose our contracts . 
We will lose to the French , we will lose to the Swedes , we 'll lose to the Japanese . " 
And therefore , there was a indeed a prisoner 's dilemma , which made it very difficult for an individual company , an individual exporting country to say , " We are not going to continue this deadly , disastrous habit of large companies to bribe . " 
So this is what I mean with a failing governance structure , because even the powerful government , which we have in Germany , comparatively , was not able to say , " We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad . " 
They needed help , and the large companies themselves have this dilemma . 
Many of them did n't want to bribe . 
Many of the German companies , for instance , believe that they are really producing a high - quality product at a good price , so they are very competitive . 
They are not as good at bribing as many of their international competitors are , but they were not allowed to show their strengths , because the world was eaten up by grand corruption . 
And this is why I 'm telling you this : Civil society rose to the occasion . 
We had this small NGO , Transparency International . 
They began to think of an escape route from this prisoner 's dilemma , and we developed concepts of collective action , basically trying to bring various competitors together around the table , explaining to all of them how much it would be in their interests if they simultaneously would stop bribing , and to make a long story short , we managed to eventually get Germany to sign together with the other OECD countries and a few other exporters . 
In 1997 , a convention , under the auspices of the OECD , which obliged everybody to change their laws and criminalize foreign bribery . 
Well , thank you . I mean , it 's interesting , in doing this , we had to sit together with the companies . 
We had here in Berlin , at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee , we had sessions with about 20 captains of industry , and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery . 
In the first session -- we had three sessions over the course of two years . 
And President von Weizsäcker , by the way , chaired one of the sessions , the first one , to take the fear away from the entrepreneurs , who were not used to deal with non - governmental organizations . 
And in the first session , they all said , " This is not bribery , what we are doing . " This is customary there . 
This is what these other cultures demand . 
They even applaud it . 
In fact , [ unclear ] still says this today . 
And so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing . 
But in the second session , they admitted already that they would never do this , what they are doing in these other countries , here in Germany , or in the U.K. , and so on . 
Cabinet ministers would admit this . 
And in the final session , at the Aspen Institute , we had them all sign an open letter to the Kohl government , at the time , requesting that they participate in the OECD convention . 
And this is , in my opinion , an example of soft power , because we were able to convince them that they had to go with us . 
We had a longer - term time perspective . 
We had a broader , geographically much wider , constituency we were trying to defend . 
And that 's why the law has changed . 
That 's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in and that 's why MIN is in the trouble they are in . 
In some other countries , the OECD convention is not yet properly enforced . 
And , again , civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment . 
In London , for instance , where the BAE got away with a huge corruption case , which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute , 100 million British pounds , every year for ten years , to one particular official of one particular friendly country , who then bought for 44 billion pounds of military equipment . 
This case , they are not prosecuting in the UK . 
Why ? Because they consider this as contrary to the security interest of the people of Great Britain . 
Civil society is pushing , civil society is trying to get a solution to this problem , also in the U.K. , and also in Japan , which is not properly enforcing , and so on . 
In Germany , we are pushing the ratification of the UN convention , which is a subsequent convention . 
We are , Germany , is not ratifying . 
Why ? Because it would make it necessary to criminalize the corruption of deputies . 
In Germany , we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant , but you are allowed to bribe a deputy . 
This is , under German law , allowed , and the members of our parliament do n't want to change this , and this is why they ca n't sign the U.N. convention against foreign bribery -- one of they very , very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world , but not able to ratify the convention , which we managed to get on the books with about 160 countries all over the world . 
I see my time is ticking . 
Let me just try to draw some conclusions from what has happened . 
I believe that what we managed to achieve in fighting corruption , one can also achieve in other areas of failing governance . 
By now , the United Nations is totally on our side . 
The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus ; under Wolfensohn , they became , I would say , the strongest anti - corruption agency in the world . 
Most of the large companies are now totally convinced that they have to put in place very strong policies against bribery and so on . 
And this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem , in the development of remedies , in the implementation of reforms , and then later , in the monitoring of reforms . 
Of course , if civil society organizations want to play that role , they have to grow into this responsibility . 
Not all civil society organizations are good . 
The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO . 
So , we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself . 
They have to have a much more transparent financial governance . 
They have to have a much more participatory governance in many civil society organizations . 
We also need much more competence of civil society leaders . 
This is why we have set up the governance school and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin , because we believe most of our educational and research institutions in Germany and continental Europe in general , do not focus enough , yet , on empowering civil society and training the leadership of civil society . 
But what I 'm saying from my very practical experience : If civil society does it right and joins the other actors -- in particular , governments , governments and their international institutions , but also large international actors , in particular those which have committed themselves to corporate social responsibility -- then in this magical triangle between civil society , government and private sector , there is a tremendous chance for all of us to create a better world . 
Thank you .

Franco Sacchi tours Nigeria 's booming Nollywood 
I have a story , a story that I would like to share with you . 
And it 's an African story . 
It is a story of hope , resilience and glamour . 
There was Hollywood . 
Then came Bollywood . 
Today we have Nollywood , the third - largest film industry in the world . 
In 2006 alone , almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria . 
Now , try to imagine 40 , 50 films wrapped , distributed , every week in the streets of Lagos , Nigeria and West Africa . 
Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars . 
It has created thousands , if not tens of thousands of jobs . 
And it 's expanding . 
But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement . 
This is something that happened without foreign investment , without government aid , and actually , it happened against all odds , in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy . 
The industry is 15 years old . 
And so maybe you 're thinking now , why , how , an Italian filmmaker based in Boston is so interested in this story ? 
And so I think I have to tell you just a few words , a few things about my personal life , because I think there is a connection . 
My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia . 
My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa . 
And I was born in Zambia . 
Even though I left when I was only three years old , I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life . 
And it really was a place where I learned to walk . 
I think I uttered the first words , and my family bought their first home . 
So when we came back to Italy , and one of the things that I remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories . 
It seemed that for our neighbors and friends , Africa was either this exotic place , this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination , or the place of horror , famine . 
And so we were always caught in this stereotype . 
And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives , and have dreams like we all have . 
So when I read in a newspaper in the business page the story of Nollywood , I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions . 
Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do , and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me . 
I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker - in - residence at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University . 
And we really look how digital technology is changing , and how young , independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost . 
So when I proposed the story , I really had all the support to make this film . 
And not only had the support , I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure . 
Aimee Corrigan , a very talented and young photographer , and Robert Caputo , a friend and a mentor , who is a veteran of National Geographic , and told me , " You know , Franco , in 25 years of covering Africa , I do n't know if I have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun . " 
So we went to Lagos in October 2005 . 
And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa , a wonderful , talented film director who is with us tonight . 
The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood , of this incredible film industry , following Bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption , called " Checkpoint . " 
Police corruption . 
And he had nine days to make it . 
We thought this was a good story . 
In the meantime , we had to cover Nollywood , and we talked to a lot of filmmakers . 
But I do n't want to create too many expectations . 
I would like to show you six minutes . 
And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience . 
There are several themes from the documentary , but they are re - edited and made for you , OK ? 
So I guess it 's a world premier . 
Man : Action . 
Milverton Nwokedi : You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here . 
And you shoot in seven days . 
Peace Piberesima : We 're doing films for the masses . 
We 're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses . 
They can afford to watch their " Robocop " and whatever . 
Mahmood Ali Balogun : I think filmmaking in Nigeria , for those who work in it , is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living . 
It 's not the fancy filmmaking where you say , oh , you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood , and where you have big budgets . 
Here is that you make these films , it sells , you jump onto the location again to make another film , because if you do n't make the next film , you 're not going to feed . 
Bond Emeruwa : So while we 're entertaining , we should be able to educate . 
I believe in the power of audiovisuals . 
I mean , 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood . 
I think it 's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable . 
So if you 're making a movie , no matter what your topic is , put in a message in there . 
Woman : You still have to report the incident . 
He needs proper medical attention . 
PP : I keep trying to explain to people , it 's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming . 
I mean , there are those films that people are making for quality , but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day , and these are the people that really watch these films . 
Sonny McDon W : Nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world . 
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa . 
Lancelot Imasen : But our films , they are stories that our people can relate to themselves . 
They are stories about our people , for our people . 
And consistently , they are glued to their screen whenever they see the story . 
Narrator : Suspense , fun and intrigue . 
It 's the blockbuster comedy . 
You 'll crack your ribs . 
Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi : We have been so deep into the foreign movies . 
It 's all about the foreign movies . 
But we can do something too . 
We can do something , something that when the world sees it , they say , wow , this is Nigeria . 
Man : Just arrest yourself , sergeant . 
Do n't embarrass yourself . 
Come on . Do n't run away . Come back . Come back . 
SMW : You can now walk the street and see a role model . 
It ’s not just what you see in picture . 
You see the person live . 
You see how he talks . You see how he lives . 
He influences you really good , you know . 
It ’s not just what you see in the picture . 
It is not what you hear , you know , from the Western press . 
Man : See you . Bye . 
Action . 
Saint Obi : I was so fascinated , you know , with those cowboy movies . 
But then when I discovered the situation in my country , at that time there was so much corruption . 
For a young man to really make it out here , you got to think of some negative things and all that , or some kind of vices . 
And I did n't want that , you know . 
And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor , without doing crime , without cheating nobody , without telling no lies . 
Just me and God - given talent . 
Man : Let 's go . 
OK , it 's time to kick some ass . 
Cover this . It 's your own . 
Move it . 
Roboger Animadu : In big countries , when they do the movies , they have all these things in place . 
But here , we improvise these items , like the gunshots . 
Like they go , here , now , now , you see the gun there , but you wo n't see any guns shot , we use knock - out . 
Kevin Books Ikeduba : What I 'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face . 
Woman : That 's why I use enough masking tape . 
The masking tape will hold it . 
Wat , wait . Just hold this for me . 
KBI : I 'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it wo n't affect my face -- the explosion , you know . 
But she 's a professional . She knows what she ’s doing . 
I 'm trying to protect my face too . 
This ai n't going to be my last movie . 
You know , this is Nollywood , where the magic lives . 
RA : So now you 're about to see how we do our own movies here , with or without any assistance from anybody . 
Man : Action . 
Cut . 
Franco Sacchi : So many things to say , so little time . 
So many themes in this story . 
I just ca n't tell you -- there ’s one thing I want to tell you . 
I spent , you know , several weeks with all these actors , producers , and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for , you know , a Westerner , a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe . 
But always with a smile , always with an enthusiasm , that is incredible . 
Werner Herzog , the German filmmaker said , " I need to make movies like you need oxygen . " 
And I think they ’re breathing . 
The Nigerian filmmakers really , really , are doing what they like . 
And so it 's a very , very important thing for them , and for their audiences . 
A woman told me , " When I see a Nollywood film , I can relax , I really -- I can breathe better . " 
There is also another very important thing that I hope will resonate with this audience . 
It ’s technology . I ’m very interested in it and I really think that the digital non - linear editing has slashed , you know , the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be . 
Incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars . 
And this has unleashed tremendous energy . 
And guess what ? 
We did n’t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers . 
They understood it , they embraced the technology and they run with it , and they ’re successful . 
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways . 
I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology , look at the Nigerian model , make their films , create jobs , create a narrative for the population , something to identify , something positive , something that really is psychological relief and it 's part of the culture . 
But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us . 
I really think it goes both ways . 
Filmmakers , friends of mine , they look at Nollywood and they say , " Wow , they are doing what we really want to do , and make a buck and live with this job . " 
So I really think it ’s a lesson that we 're actually learning from them . 
And there 's one thing , one small challenge that I have for you , and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling . 
And I think this is really the theme of this session . 
Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter , but no stories . 
No stories around the campfire . 
No legends , no fairytales . 
Nothing . 
No novels . 
Difficult , eh ? It 's meaningless . 
So this is what I really think . 
I think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers , and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this . 
I would like you to hear their voices . 
Just a few moments . 
It ’s not an added sequence , just some voices from Nollywood . 
Toyin Alousa : Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them . 
If you have an industry that puts a smile on people 's face , that ’s Nollywood . 
SO : I believe very soon , we ’re not only going to have better movies , we 'll have that original Nigerian movie . 
BE : It ’s still the same basic themes . 
Love , action . 
But we 're telling it our own way , our own Nigerian way , African way . 
We have diverse cultures , diverse cultures , there are so many , that in the natal lifetimes , I do n't see us exhausting the stories we have . 
FS : My job ends here , and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work . 
And I really hope that there will be many , many collaborations , where we teach each other things . 
And I really hope that this will happen . 
Thank you very much . 
Chris Anderson : Stop . I 've got two questions . 
Franco , you described this as the world 's third largest film industry . 
What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films , really ? 
FS : Oh , yes . I think I mentioned briefly -- it 's close to 2,000 films . 
There is scientific data on this . 
CA : 2,000 films a year ? 
FS : 2,000 films a year . 2005 or 6 , the censor board has censored 1,600 films alone . 
And we know that there are more . 
So it ’s safe to say that there are 2,000 films . 
So imagine 45 films per week . 
There are challenges . There are challenges . 
There is a glut of film , the quality has to be raised , they need to go to the next level , but I ’m optimistic . 
CA : And these are n’t films that are primarily seen in cinemas ? 
FS : Oh yes , of course . This is very important . 
Maybe , you know , for you to try to imagine this , these are films that are distributed directly in markets . 
They are bought in video shops . 
They can be rented for pennies . 
CA : On what format ? 
FS : Oh , the format -- thank you for the question . Yes , it 's VCDs . 
It 's a CD , it 's a little bit more compressed image . 
They started with VHS . 
They actually did n't wait for , you know , the latest technology . 
They started in ' 92 , ' 94 . 
So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria that play , you know , VHS and these VCDs . 
It 's a CD basically . It 's a compact disc . 
CA : So on the streets , are film casts ... ? 
FS : You can be in a Lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water . Yes . 
And I have to say , this really proves that storytelling , it 's a commodity , it 's a staple . 
There is no life without stories . 
CA : Franco , thank you so much .

Frank Gehry as a young rebel 
I 'm going to go right into the slides . 
And all I 'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff . 
And my ideas are -- in my head , anyway -- they 're very logical and relate to what 's going on and problem solving for clients . 
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems , or I really do solve their problems , because usually they seem to like it . 
Let me go right into the slides . 
Can you turn off the light ? Down . 
I like to be in the dark . 
I do n't want you to see what I 'm doing up here . 
Anyway , I did this house in Santa Monica , and it got a lot of notoriety . 
In fact , it appeared in a porno comic book , which is the slide on the right . 
This is in Venice . 
I just show it because I want you to know I 'm concerned about context . 
On the left - hand side , I had the context of those little houses , and I tried to build a building that fit into that context . 
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird , and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they 're photographed or seen in that space . 
And then , once I deal with the context , I then try to make a place that 's comfortable and private and fairly serene , as I hope you 'll find that slide on the right . 
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A. 
I was concerned about making a place for the study of law . 
And we continue to work with this client . 
The building on the right at the top is now under construction . 
The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down , finally , and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we 've created , this campus . 
And it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place . 
They wanted a sense of place . 
And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown , in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into . 
And it was my theory , or my point of view , that one did n't upstage the neighborhood -- one made accommodations . 
I tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings I liked or not . 
In the ' 60s I started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale 's . 
We even made flooring , walls and everything , out of cardboard . 
And the success of it threw me for a loop . 
I could n't deal with the success of furniture -- I was n't secure enough as an architect -- and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like . 
So , nobody would like this . 
And it was in this , preliminary to these pieces of furniture , that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice . 
And after we failed , I just kept failing . 
The piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket . 
And I put a piece of tape around it , as you see there , and realized you could sit on it , and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on . 
So , it was an accidental discovery . 
I got into fish . 
I mean , the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po - mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man , and if you 're going to go back , we might as well go back to the beginning . 
And so I started making these funny things . 
And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the Walker . 
And then , I sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what I was learning about the form of the fish and the movement . 
And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- accidental , again -- it was an intuitive kind of thing , and I just kept going with it , and made this proposal for a building , which was only a proposal . 
I did this building in Japan . 
I was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed . 
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff . 
And after I got -- I was really drunk -- I was asked to do some sketches on napkins . 
And I made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and Morandi - like things that I used to do . 
And the client said , " Why no fish ? " 
And so I made a drawing with a fish , and I left Japan . 
Three weeks later , I received a complete set of drawings saying we 'd won the competition . 
Now , it 's hard to do . It 's hard to translate a fish form , because they 're so beautiful -- perfect -- into a building or object like this . 
And Oldenburg , who I work with a little once in a while , told me I could n't do it , and so that made it even more exciting . 
But he was right -- I could n't do the tail . 
I started to get the head OK , but the tail I could n't do . 
It was pretty hard . 
The thing on the right is a snake form , a ziggurat . 
And I put them together , and you walk between them . 
It was a dialog with the context again . 
Now , if you saw a picture of this as it was published in Architectural Record -- they did n't show the context , so you would think , " God , what a pushy guy this is . " 
But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant . 
Could n't find it . 
So ... 
As for craft and technology and all those things that you 've all been talking about , I was thrown for a complete loop . 
This was built in six months . 
The way we sent drawings to Japan : we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models , and we used to make foam models , which that thing scanned . 
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales . 
And when I got there , everything was perfect -- except the tail . 
So , I decided to cut off the head and the tail . 
And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker . 
And it 's one of the nicest pieces I 've ever made , I think . 
And then Jay Chiat , a friend and client , asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A. 
For reasons we do n't want to talk about , it got delayed . 
Toxic waste , I guess , is the key clue to that one . 
And so we built a temporary building -- I 'm getting good at temporary -- and we put a conference room in that 's a fish . 
And , finally , Jay dragged me to my hometown , Toronto , Canada . 
And there is a story -- it 's a real story -- about my grandmother buying a carp on Thursday , bringing it home , putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid . 
I played with it in the evening . 
When I went to sleep , the next day it was n't there . 
And the next night , we had gefilte fish . 
And so I set up this interior for Jay 's offices and I made a pedestal for a sculpture . 
And he did n't buy a sculpture , so I made one . 
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother 's , and I put the fish in . 
It was a joke . 
I play with funny people like [ Claes ] Oldenburg . 
We 've been friends for a long time . 
And we 've started to work on things . 
A few years ago , we did a performance piece in Venice , Italy , called " Il Corso del Coltello " -- the Swiss Army knife . 
And most of the imagery is -- Claes ' , but those two little boys are my sons , and they were Claes ' assistants in the play . 
He was the Swiss Army knife . 
He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter , and I was Frankie P. Toronto . 
P for Palladio . 
Dressed up like the AT&T building by Claes -- with a fish hat . 
The highlight of the performance was at the end . 
This beautiful object , the Swiss Army knife , which I get credit for participating in . 
And I can tell you -- it 's totally an Oldenburg . 
I had nothing to do with it . 
The only thing I did was , I made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal , because I love sailing . 
We made it into a sailing craft . 
I 've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing . 
I do it because it 's a curious thing in the culture , when things are made in such great quantities , absorbed in such great quantities , and there 's so much denial about them . 
People hate it . 
And I 'm fascinated with that , which , like the paper furniture -- it 's one of those materials . 
And I 'm always drawn to that . 
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link , which nobody will forgive me for . 
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School . 
And that chain link is really expensive . 
It 's in perspective and everything . 
And then we did a camp together for children with cancer . 
And you can see , we started making a building together . 
Of course , the milk can is his . 
But we were trying to collide our ideas , to put objects next to each other . 
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life . 
And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together . 
Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in Venice , and I started with this three - piece thing , and you entered in the middle . 
And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle . 
And he pushed that . 
And one day I had a -- oh , well , the other way . 
I had the binoculars from Claes , and I put them there , and I could never get rid of them after that . 
Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal . 
It made my building look sick . 
And it was this interaction between that kind of , up - the - ante stuff that became pretty interesting . 
It led to the building on the left . 
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars , you know , leaving out the -- what the hell . 
I use a lot of metal in my work , and I have a hard time connecting with the craft . 
The whole thing about my house , the whole use of rough carpentry and everything , was the frustration with the crafts available . 
I said , " If I ca n't get the craft that I want , I 'll use the craft I can get . " 
There were plenty of models for that , in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns , and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials . 
I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture . 
And it was all of one material , and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls . 
The metalworkers , for the most part , do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff . 
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers ' unions of America and Canada in Washington , and I did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings , etc . etc . 
And it 's working very well to have these people , these craftsmen , interested in it . 
I just tell the stories . 
It 's a way of connecting , at least , with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture . 
The metal continued into a building -- Herman Miller , in Sacramento . 
And it 's just a complex of factory buildings . 
And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place -- a people place . 
I mean , it 's kind of a trite thing to say , but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be , where the people would come and where the people working would interact . 
So it 's out in the middle of nowhere , and you approach it . 
It 's copper and galvanize . 
I used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge , so it would buckle . 
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier 's aesthetic . 
Everybody 's trying to get the panels perfect , and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy . 
And they end up looking like stone . 
This is the central area . 
There 's a ramp . 
And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman . 
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job . 
And when I was awarded the contract I , at the very beginning , asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me . 
Because these were ideas that we were talking about , building things next to each other , making -- it 's all about [ a ] metaphor for a city , maybe . 
And so Stanley did the little dome thing . 
And we did it over the phone and by fax . 
He would send me a fax and show me something . 
He 'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower . 
I told him , " No , no , that 's too ongepotchket . 
I do n't want the tower . " 
So he came back with a simpler building , but he put some funny details on it , and he moved it closer to my building . 
And so I decided to put him in a depression . 
I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in . 
And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax , going back and forth over a couple of weeks ' period . 
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it . 
And so then I put this big billboard behind it . 
And I call it , " David and Goliath . " 
And that 's my cafeteria . 
In Boston , we had that old building on the left . 
It was a very prominent building off the freeway , and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood , which had these cornices , projecting cornices . 
Mine got a little exuberant , but I used lead copper , which is a beautiful material , and it turns green in 100 years . 
Instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 . 
We redid the side of the building and re - proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space . 
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved , because they have very strict kind of design guideline , and they would n't normally think I would fit them . 
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building . 
In Barcelona , on Las Ramblas for some film festival , I did the Hollywood sign going and coming , made a building out of it , and they built it . 
I flew in one night and took this picture . 
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me . 
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica -- a little shopping center . 
And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa , in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back . 
It 's the support labs , which , by some coincidence , required no windows . 
And the shape fit perfectly . 
I just joined the points . 
In the curved part there 's all the mechanical equipment . 
That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon -- and so it was an opportunity that I seized , because I did n't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form . 
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it . 
This is a small house somewhere . 
They 've been building it so long I do n't remember where it is . 
It 's in the West Valley . 
And we started with the stream and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake . 
These are the models . 
The reality , with the lake -- the workmanship is pretty bad . 
And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house . 
When you have to do something really cheaply , it 's hard to get perfect corners and stuff . 
That big metal thing is a passage , and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom , which is on the right . 
It 's kind of like a whole built town . 
I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale . 
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that . 
This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota . 
The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it . 
He was too busy . 
He did n't recommend me , by the way . 
We ended up having to make it a sculpture , because the dilemma was , how do you build a building that does n't look like the language ? 
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub - divided ? 
Etc . etc . 
You 've got the idea . 
And so we finally ended up making it . 
These people are art collectors . 
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side . 
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it . 
It 's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin - Ply -- it 's that formed lumber from Finland . 
We used it at Loyola on the chapel , and it did n't work . 
I keep trying to make it work . 
In this case we learned how to detail it . 
In Cleveland , there 's Burnham Mall , on the left . 
It 's never been finished . 
Going out to the lake , you can see all those new buildings we built . 
And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site . 
There 's a railroad track . 
This is the city hall over here somewhere , and the courthouse . 
And the centerline of the mall goes out . 
Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built , and so we followed . 
Sohio is on the axis here , and we followed the axis , and they 're two kind of goalposts . 
And this is our building , which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company . 
We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top , folded . 
The health club is fastened to the garage with a C - clamp , for Cleveland . 
You drive down . 
So it 's about a 10-story C - clamp . 
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum , and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry . 
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries . 
And this would be a hotel . 
So , the centerline of this thing -- we 'd preserve it , and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox , etc . , that are underway . 
It 's hard to do high - rise . 
I feel much more comfortable down here . 
This is a piece of property in Brentwood . 
And a long time ago , about ' 82 or something , after my house -- I designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard -- and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left . 
And she came back , I guess wealthier or something -- something happened -- and asked me to design a house for her on this site . 
And following that basic idea of the village , we changed it as we got into it . 
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end -- here you see on the photographs of the site -- slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall , creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom , which I designed like a kind of a barge , looking like a boat . 
And that 's it , built . 
The dome was a request from the client . 
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house . 
She did n't care where . 
When you sleep in this bedroom , I hope -- I mean , I have n't slept in it yet . 
I 've offered to marry her so I could sleep there , but she said I did n't have to do that . 
But when you 're in that room , you feel like you 're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake . 
And it 's very private . 
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden . 
And then up above there 's a garden on this side of the living room , and one on the other side . 
These are n't focused very well . 
I do n't know how to do it from here . 
Focus the one on the right . 
It 's up there . 
Left -- it 's my right . 
Anyway , you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees . 
That 's the living room . 
Servants ' quarters . 
A guest bedroom , which has this dome with marble on it . 
And then you enter into the living room and then so on . 
This is the bedroom . 
You come down from this level along the stairway , and you enter the bedroom here , going into the lake . 
And the bed is back in this space , with windows looking out onto the lake . 
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot . 
The material is lead copper , like in the building in Boston . 
And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it 's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it . 
And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis with the dining room table . 
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free . 
But the idea is , the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside . 
Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up -- and it will be very private . 
And you feel like you 're in your own kind of village . 
This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney . 
We 're doing some work for him . 
And this is in Anaheim , California , and it 's a freeway building . 
You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour , and there 's another bridge here . 
And you 're through this room in a split second , and the building will sort of reflect that . 
On the backside , it 's much more humane -- entrance , dining hall , etc . 
And then this thing here -- I 'm hoping as you drive by you 'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it . 
Kind of a fun thing to do . 
I 'm doing a building in Switzerland , Basel , which is an office building for a furniture company . 
And we struggled with the image . 
These are the early studies , but they have to sell furniture to normal people , so if I did the building and it was too fancy , then people might say , " Well , the furniture looks OK in his thing , but no , it ai n't going to look good in my normal building . " 
So we 've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here , and we 've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate . 
And you 're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces . 
This is in Paris , along the Seine . 
Palais des Sports , the Gare de Lyon over here . 
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here . 
There 's a new library across the river . 
And back in here , in this already treed park , we 're doing a very dense building called the American Center , which has a theater , apartments , dance school , an art museum , restaurants and all kinds of -- it 's a very dense program -- bookstores , etc . 
In a very tight , small -- this is the ground level . 
And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off . 
They call it the plan coupe . 
And I struggled with that thing -- how to get around the corner . 
These are the models for it . 
I showed you the other model , the one -- this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing -- so I understood the problem . 
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it ? 
Apartments , etc . 
And these are the kind of study models we did . 
And the one on the left is pretty awful . 
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built . 
But out of it came finally this resolution , where the elevator piece worked frontally to this , parallel to this street , and also parallel to here . 
And then this kind of twist , with this balcony and the skirt , kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer . 
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc . 
So it would all be built in stone , in French limestone , except for this metal piece . 
And it faces into a park . 
And the idea was to make this express the energy of this . 
On the side facing the street it 's much more normal , except I slipped a few mansards down , so that coming on the point , these housing units made a gesture to the corner . 
And this will be some kind of high - tech billboard . 
If any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me . 
I do n't know what to do . 
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment , and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons . 
And it 's got a fish . 
And I keep thinking , " This is going to be the last fish . " 
It 's like a drug addict . 
I say , " I 'm not going to do it anymore -- I do n't want to do it anymore -- I 'm not going to do it . " 
And then I do it . 
There it is . 
But it 's the living room . 
And this piece here is -- I do n't know what it is . 
I just added it so that we 'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out . 
This is Euro Disney , and I 've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier . 
We 've had a lot of fun working together . 
I think I 'm from Mars for them , and they are for me , but somehow we all manage to work together , and I think , productively . 
So far . 
This is a shopping thing . 
You come into the Magic Kingdom and the hotel that Tony Baxter 's group is doing out here . 
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall , with a rodeo and restaurants . 
And another restaurant . 
What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull , I made a light grid that 's perpendicular to the train station , to the route of the train . 
It looks like it 's kind of been there , and then crashed all these simpler forms into it . 
The light grid will have a light , be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling . 
In Switzerland -- Germany , actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel , we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum . 
And I tried to -- there 's a Nick Grimshaw building over here , there 's an Oldenburg sculpture over here -- I tried to make a relationship urbanistically . 
And I do n't gave good slides to show -- it 's just been completed -- but this piece here is this building , and these pieces here and here . 
And as you pass by it 's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood . 
It 's plaster and just zinc . 
And you wonder , if this is a museum , what it 's going to be like inside ? 
If it 's going to be so busy and crazy that you would n't show anything , and just wait . 
I 'm so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful . 
But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit . 
It 's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff . 
And from the building in the back , you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills . 
I know I 'm over time . 
See , that skylight goes down and becomes that one . 
So it 's pretty quiet inside . 
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall . 
It 's a complicated project . 
It has a chamber hall . 
It 's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring . 
And it 's not a great building , but I approached it optimistically , that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us . 
And the plan of this -- it 's a concert hall . 
This is the foyer , which is kind of a garden structure . 
There 's commercial at the ground floor . 
These are offices , which , really , in the competition , we did n't have to design . 
But finally , there 's a hotel there . 
These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler , composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA , etc . 
The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria , which led to this compartmentalized scheme , which we found out after the competition would not work at all . 
But everybody liked these forms and liked the space , and so that 's one of the problems of a competition . 
You have to then try and get that back in some way . 
And we studied many models . 
This was our original model . 
These were the three buildings that were the ideal -- the Concertgebouw , Boston and Berlin . 
Everybody liked the surround . 
Actually , this is the smallest hall in size , and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies . 
Our client does n't want balconies , so -- and when we met our new acoustician , he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape . 
And we tried many shapes , trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical , acceptable format . 
We finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the Concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls , which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they were n't , but now we have them . 
And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room . 
That 's the idea . 
And the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural . 
And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit , and create intimacy . 
Now , this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being -- and so I would n't take it literally , except the feeling of the space . 
We studied the acoustics with laser stuff , and they bounce them off this and see where it all works . 
But you get the sense of the hall in section . 
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium . 
In this case we 're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners . 
And so it will be quite a different shape . 
The original building , because it was frog - like , fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well . 
When you get into a box , it 's harder to do it -- and here we are , struggling with how to put the hotel in . 
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi . 
I just stuck it on there . 
But this is how I do work . I do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away . 
And of course it 's not going to look like that , but it is the crazy way I tend to work . 
And then finally , in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower , the highest building in L.A. 
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs . 
And I was asked to do a fish , and so I did a snake . 
It 's a public space , and I made it kind of a garden structure , and you can go in it . 
It 's a kiva , and Larry 's putting some water in there , and it works much better than a fish . 
In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish , and we 're working on that , at the foot of a Ritz - Carlton Tower being done by Skidmore , Owings and Merrill . 
And the Ritz - Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel , non - fire proof , much like those old gas tanks . 
And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it , perverted it , into the form of the fish , and created a kind of a 19th - century contraption that looks like , that will sit -- this is the beach and the harbor out in front , and this is really a shopping center with department stores . 
And we split these bridges . 
Originally , this was all solid with a hole in it . 
We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel . 
We showed this to the hotel people the other day , and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the Ritz - Carlton anymore , because of this fish . 
And finally , I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger . 
I did n't expect Lou Danziger to be here , but this is a building I did for him in 1964 , I think . 
A little studio -- and it 's sadly for sale . 
Time goes on . 
And this is my son working with me on a small fast - food thing . 
He designed the robot as the cashier , and the head moves , and I did the rest of it . 
And the food was n't as good as the stuff , and so it failed . 
It should have been the other way around -- the food should have been good first . 
It did n't work . 
Thank you very much .

Amy Smith shares simple , lifesaving design 
In terms of invention , I 'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects . 
I think it 's one of the most exciting that I 'm working on , but I think it 's also the simplest . 
It 's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world . 
It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet , the number one cause of death in children under five , which is ... ? Water - borne diseases ? Diarrhea ? Malnutrition ? 
No , it 's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this . Can you believe that ? 
I find this shocking and somewhat appalling . 
Ca n't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ? 
Ca n't we make better stoves ? 
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year ? 
I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes , so I 'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro - tubes , which is charcoal . 
So this is a picture of rural Haiti . Haiti is now 98 percent deforested . 
You 'll see scenes like this all over the island . 
It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation . 
A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that 's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil . 
So the rains come , they go down the rivers , and the flooding happens . 
Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this : people need to cook , and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it . 
It 's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage . 
They know perfectly well , but they have no other choice . 
Fossil fuels are not available , and solar energy does n't cook the way that they like their food prepared . 
And so this is what they do . 
You 'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree , cut it down and make charcoal out of it . 
So not surprisingly , there 's a lot of effort that 's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels . 
About four years ago I took a team of students down to Haiti , and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there . 
This is one such volunteer , and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked . 
And the idea was that you could take waste paper ; you could compress it ; and make briquettes that could be used for fuel . 
But this device was very slow . 
So our engineering students went to work on it , and with some very simple changes , they were able to triple the throughput of this device . 
So you could imagine they were very excited about it . 
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them . 
And one of the things that they found was they did n't burn . 
So it was a little discouraging to the students . 
And in fact if you look closely , right here , you can see it says , " U.S. Peace Corps . " 
As it turns out , there actually was n't any waste paper in this village . 
And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village , it was 800 kilometers away . 
And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel . 
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level . 
You see these all over Haiti as well . They 're small - scale sugar mills . 
And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called " bagasse . " 
It has no other use . It has no nutritional value , so they do n't feed it to the animals . 
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it . 
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with , something like charcoal . 
So over the next couple of years , students and I worked to develop a process . 
So you start with the bagasse , and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five - gallon oil drum . 
After some time , after setting it on fire , you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln , and then you end up with this carbonized material here . 
However , you ca n't burn this . It 's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking . 
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes . 
And conveniently , one of my students was from Ghana , and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called " kokonte , " which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root . 
And so what we did was we looked , and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti , under the name of " manioc . " 
And in fact , it 's grown all over the world -- yucca , tapioca , manioc , cassava , it 's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable . 
And you can make a very thick , sticky porridge out of it , which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes . 
So we did this . We went down to Haiti . 
These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Chabon , or Charcoal Institute . And these -- -- that 's right . So I 'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT . 
And these are the briquettes that we made . 
Now I 'm going to take you to a different continent . This is India , and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India ; it 's cow dung . 
And more than in Haiti , this produces really smoky fires , and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel . 
Kids and women are especially affected by it , because they 're the ones who are around the cooking fires . 
So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal - making technology there . 
Well unfortunately , they did n't have sugarcane and they did n't have cassava , but that did n't stop us . 
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass . 
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area . 
And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure , which they used ordinarily for their fuel . 
And we did side - by - side tests , and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung . 
And you can see that it 's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel . 
And in fact , it heats the water a lot more quickly . 
And so we were very happy , thus far . 
But one of the things that we found was when we did side - by - side comparisons with wood charcoal , it did n't burn as long . And the briquettes crumbled a little bit , and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking . 
So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti . 
So we went back to MIT , we took out the Instron machine , and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it ? 
And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this , we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process , to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there . 
And after some time , we developed a low - cost press that allows you to produce charcoal , which actually now burns longer , cleaner than wood charcoal . 
So now we 're in a situation where we have a product , which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace , which is a very wonderful place to be . 
In Haiti alone , about 30 million trees are cut down every year . 
There 's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those . 
In addition , the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars . 
That 's an awful lot for a country of Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars . 
So this is where we 're also moving ahead with our charcoal project . 
And one of the things that I think is also interesting , is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who 's been doing risk analysis . 
And he 's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal . 
And he 's found that worldwide , you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel . That 's remarkable , but up until now , there were n't ways to do it without cutting down trees . 
But now we have a way that 's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel . 
One of the really exciting things , though , is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month . 
And this is , I think , the coolest thing , and it 's even lower tech than what you just saw , if you can imagine such a thing . Here it is . 
So what is this ? This is corncobs turned into charcoal . 
And the beauty of this is that you do n't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made . This is my $ 100 laptop , right here . 
And actually , like Nick , I brought samples . 
So we can pass these around . 
They 're fully functional , field - tested , ready to roll out . 
And I think one of the things , which is also remarkable about this technology , is that the technology transfer is so easy . 
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal , where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder , this comes pre - briquetted . 
And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now , which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life . 
But once you see it , like you guys in the front row , all right , yeah , OK . So anyway -- -- here it is . And this is I think a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non - zero - sum things . 
So not only do you have health benefits , you have environmental benefits . 
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits . 
People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products . 
They can generate income from this . 
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal , and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who are n't making their own . 
It 's really rare that you do n't have trade - offs between health and economics , or environment and economics . 
So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting , and I 'm really looking forward to see where it takes us . 
So when we talk about , now , the future we will create , one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in . 
And now I do n't actually mean the world that we live in . 
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat . 
I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand , and where , when you work 10 hours a day , you 're still only earning 60 dollars in a month . 
I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water . 
That 's as if the entire workforce of the State of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water . 
It 's a place where , for example , if this were India , in this room , only three of us would have a car . 
If this were Afghanistan , only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet . 
If this were Zambia , 300 of you would be farmers , 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV . 
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day . 
These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for . 
These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers , our designers , our business people , our entrepreneurs to be facing . 
These are the solutions that we need to find . 
I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address . 
One of them is creating technologies to promote micro - finance and micro - enterprise , so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they 're not doing it using the same traditional basket making , poultry rearing , etc . 
But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale . 
The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops . 
And we need to rethink our development strategies , so that we 're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers , but rather to stop being poor farmers . 
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively . 
We need to work with the people in these communities , and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems . That 's the best way to do it . 
We should n't be doing it from outside . 
So we need to create this future , and we need to start doing it now . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : Tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you 've worked on . 
Amy Smith : A couple of other things that we 're working on are looking at ways to do low - cost water quality testing , so that communities can maintain their own water systems , know when they 're working , know when they treat them , etc . 
We 're also looking at low - cost water treatment systems . 
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that . 
CA : What 's the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale ? 
Do you need to find entrepreneurs , or venture capitalists , or what do you need to take what you 've got and get it to scale ? 
AS : Yeah , I think its large numbers of people moving it forward . 
It 's a difficult thing ; it 's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income . 
So you ca n't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward . 
And we 're a pretty small staff , which is me . 
So , you know , I do what I can with the students . 
We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward . 
The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame , as -- you know , you ca n't expect to get something done in a year or two years ; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead . 
But I think with the vision to do that , we can move forward .

Iain Hutchison : Saving faces 
Our face is hugely important because it 's the external , visual part that everybody else sees . 
Let 's not forget it 's a functional entity . 
We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body : the brain . 
It 's where our senses are located , our special senses -- our vision , our speech , our hearing , our smell , our taste . 
And this bone is peppered , as you can see , with the light shining through the skull with cavities , the sinuses , which warm and moisten the air we breathe . 
But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone -- our head would be dead weight , we would n't be able to hold it erect , we would n't be able to look at the world around us . 
This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she ca n't breathe and eat . 
Attached to the facial bones that define our face 's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression , our universal language of expression , our social - signaling system . 
And overlying this is the skin drape , which is a hugely complex three - dimensional structure -- taking right - angled bends here and there , having thin areas like the eyelids , thick areas like the cheek , different colors . 
And then we have the sensual factor of the face . 
Where do we like to kiss people ? 
On the lips . Nibble the ears maybe . 
It 's the face where we 're attracted to with that . 
But let 's not forget the hair . 
You 're looking at the image on your left - hand side -- that 's my son with his eyebrows present . 
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing . 
There 's a definite difference . 
And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose , he 'd look even odder still . 
Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we do n't see ourselves as others see us . 
It 's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves , and we only see ourselves in freeze - frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live . 
Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance . 
They do n't need this . They need psychiatric help . 
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me . 
He does n't have dysmorphophobia , but I 'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic . 
In other words , he looks entirely normal . 
Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes . 
So children judge themselves , learn to judge themselves , by the behavior of adults around them . 
Here 's a classic example : Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that 's growing out through her skull , has obliterated her nose , and she 's having difficulty seeing . 
As you can see , it 's blocking her vision . 
She 's also in danger , when she damages this , of bleeding profusely . 
Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them . 
They 've grown used to their face ; they think they 're special . 
Actually , sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed . 
And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they 've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they do n't recognize them . 
But other adults say incredibly painful things . 
They say , " How dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people . 
Should n't you be doing something about this ? Why have n't you had it removed ? " 
And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion , because -- a natural curiosity . 
And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature . 
After surgery , everything normalizes . 
The adults behave more naturally , and the children play more readily with other children . 
As teenagers -- just think back to your teenage years -- we 're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance . 
We 're trying to struggle to find our identity . 
We crave the approval of our peers . 
So our facial appearance is vital to us as we 're trying to project ourselves to the world . 
Just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days . 
How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day , practicing your sardonic look , practicing your serious look , trying to look like Sean Connery , as I did , trying to raise one eyebrow ? 
It 's a crippling time . 
I 've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward . 
I 'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward . 
Turn to the person next to you , push your lower jaws forward . Turn to the person next to you and look at them -- they look miserable . 
That 's exactly what people used to say to Sue . 
She was n't miserable at all . 
But people used to say to her , " Why are you so miserable ? " 
People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood . 
Teachers and peers were underestimating her ; she was teased at school . 
So she chose to have facial surgery . 
After the facial surgery , she said , " My face now reflects my personality . 
People know now that I 'm enthusiastic , that I 'm a happy person . " 
And that 's the change that can be achieved for teenagers . 
Is this change , though , a real change , or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves ? 
Well we studied teenagers ' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery . 
And what we found was -- we jumbled up the photographs so they could n't recognize the before and after -- what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery . 
Well that 's not surprising , but we also asked them to judge them on honesty , intelligence , friendliness , violence . 
They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics -- more violent , etc . -- before the surgery . 
After the surgery , they were perceived as being more intelligent , more friendly , more honest , less violent -- and yet we had n't operated on their intellect or their character . 
When people get older , they do n't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery . 
Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune . 
What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma . 
So this is a photograph of Henry , two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone , his upper jaw , his eye - socket . 
He looks pretty good at this stage . 
But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations , as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly . 
I learned a huge amount from Henry . 
Henry taught me that you can carry on working . 
He worked as an advocate . He continued to play cricket . 
He enjoyed life to the full , and this was probably because he had a successful , fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially . 
He maintained a calm insouciance . 
I do n't say he overcame this ; he did n't overcome it . 
This was something more than that . He ignored it . 
He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it . 
And that 's what these people can do . 
Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well . 
This is a man in his 20s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on . 
It was my longest operation . 
It took 23 hours . I did it with my neurosurgeon . 
We removed all the bones at the right side of his face -- his eye , his nose , the skull bones , the facial skin -- and reconstructed him with tissue from the back . 
He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse . 
He got married . He had a son called Jeremiah . 
And again , he said , " This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am . " 
His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family ; he had a successful , fulfilling job . 
So we 've seen that we can change people 's faces . 
But when we change people 's faces , are we changing their identity -- for better or for worse ? 
For instance , there are two different types of facial surgery . 
We can categorize it like that . 
We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery -- like Sue . 
When they have facial surgery , they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people . 
They do n't feel different . 
They feel that they 've actually gained what they never had , that their face now reflects their personality . 
And actually that 's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery . 
Because you might say , " Well , this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic . " 
If you do cosmetic surgery , patients are often less happy . 
They 're trying to achieve difference in their lives . 
Sue was n't trying to achieve difference in her life . 
She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality . 
But then we have other people who do n't choose to have facial surgery . 
They 're people who have their face shot off . 
I 'll move it off , and we 'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you . 
They have it forced upon them . 
And again , as I told you , if they have a caring family and good work life , then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives . 
Their identity does n't change . 
Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon ? 
Muzetta 's family give the lie to this . 
This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who 's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face , which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly . 
After she had surgery to remove the tumor , her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress , a pink ribbon in her hair , and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world , despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa . 
So it 's not simply a Western phenomenon . 
We make judgments on people 's faces all the time . 
It 's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces . 
He said you could see criminal faces , judging them just on the photographs that were showed . 
Good - looking people are always judged as being more friendly . 
We look at O.J. -- he 's a good - looking guy . 
We 'd like to spend time with him . He looks friendly . 
Now we know that he 's a convicted wife - batterer , and actually he 's not the good guy . 
And beauty does n't equate to goodness , and certainly does n't equate to contentment . 
So we 've talked about the static face and judging the static face , but actually , we 're more comfortable with judging the moving face . 
We think we can judge people on their expressions . 
U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity -- the blink , the hesitation . 
And so they want to see live witnesses . 
Todorov tells us that , in a tenth of a second , we can make a judgment on somebody 's face . 
Are we uncomfortable with this image ? Yes , we are . 
Would we be happy if our doctor 's face , our lawyer 's face , our financial adviser 's face was covered ? 
We 'd be pretty uncomfortable . 
But are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement ? 
The truth is that there 's a five - minute rule , not the tenth - of - a - second rule like Todorov , but a five - minute rule . 
If you spend five minutes with somebody , you start looking beyond their facial appearance , and the people who you 're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them , and the people who you did n't immediately seek out , because you did n't find them particularly attractive , become attractive people because of their personality . 
So we 've talked a lot about facial appearance . 
I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do -- where we 're at and where we 're going . 
This is an image of Ann who 's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed . 
And you can see in the images afterward , we 've managed to reconstruct her successfully . 
But that 's not good enough . 
This is what Ann wants . She wants to be out kayaking , she wants to be out climbing mountains . 
And that 's what she achieved , and that 's what we have to get to . 
This is a horrific image , so I 'm putting my hand up now . 
This is a photograph of Adi , a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery . 
And he lost his lower jaw , his lip , his chin and his upper jaw and teeth . 
This is the bar that he set for us . 
" I want to look like this . This is how I looked before . " 
So with modern technology , we used computers to make models . 
We made a model of the jaw without bone in it . 
We then bent a plate up to it . 
We put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position . 
We then put bone and tissue from the back . 
Here you can see the plate holding it , and you can see the implants being put in -- so that in one operation we achieve this and this . 
So the patient 's life is restored . 
That 's the good news . 
However , his chin skin does n't look the same as it did before . 
It 's skin from his back . 
It 's thicker , it 's darker , it 's coarser , it does n't have the contours . 
And that 's where we 're failing , and that 's where we need the face transplant . 
The face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin . 
We can replace the underlying skeletal structure , but we 're still not good at replacing the facial skin . 
So it 's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium . 
But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives . 
What does that mean ? 
They have an increased risk of infection , an increased risk of malignancy . 
This is not a life - saving transplant -- like a heart , or liver , or lung transplant -- it is a quality - of - life transplant , and as a result , are the patients going to say , if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on , " I wish I 'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I 'm now dying of a malignant cancer " ? We do n't know yet . 
We also do n't know what they feel about recognition and identity . 
Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin , who did the first operation , are studying that . 
Donors are going to be short on the ground , because how many people want to have their loved one 's face removed at the point of death ? 
So there are going to be problems with face transplantation . 
So the better news is the future 's almost here -- and the future is tissue engineering . 
Just imagine , I can make a biologically - degradable template . 
I can put it in place where it 's meant to be . 
I can sprinkle a few cells , stem cells from the patient 's own hip , a little bit of genetically engineered protein , and lo and behold , leave it for four months and the face is grown . 
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe . 
But we 've still got problems . 
We 've got mouth cancer to solve . 
We 're still not curing enough patients -- it 's the most disfiguring cancer . 
We 're still not reconstructing them well enough . 
In the U.K. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people . 
We still ca n't get rid of scars . 
We need to do research . 
And the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research . 
And we 've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future , so we do n't just sit on our laurels and say , " Okay , we 're doing okay . 
Let 's leave it as it is . " 
Thank you very much indeed .

Ann Cooper talks school lunches 
My thing with school lunch is , it 's a social justice issue . 
I 'm the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District . I have 90 employees and 17 locations , 9,600 kids . 
I 'm doing 7,100 meals a day and I 've been doing it for two years , trying to change how we feed kids in America . 
And that 's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today . 
These are some of my kids with a salad bar . 
I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there . 
Everyone says it could n't be done . 
Little kids could n't eat off the salad bar , big kids would spit in it -- neither happened . 
When I took over this , I tried to really figure out , like , what my vision would be . 
How do we really change children 's relationship to food ? 
And I 'll tell you why we need to change it , but we absolutely have to change it . 
And what I came to understand is , we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet , healthy food and healthy kids . 
And that if we do n't do that , the antithesis , although we 've heard otherwise , is we 're really going to become extinct , because we 're feeding our children to death . 
That 's my premise . 
We 're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker . 
And the reason this is happening , by and large , is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food , the way the government oversees our food , the way the USDA puts food on kids ' plates that 's unhealthy , and allows unhealthy food into schools . 
And by -- tacitly , all of us send our kids , or grandchildren , or nieces , or nephews , to school and tell them to learn , you know , learn what 's in those schools . 
And when you feed these kids bad food , that 's what they 're learning . So that 's really what this is all about . 
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness . 
We now live in a country where most of us do n't decide , by and large , what we eat . We see big businesses , Monsanto and DuPont , who brought out Agent Orange and stain - resistant carpet . 
They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country . 
These are -- 10 companies control much of what 's in our grocery stores , much of what people eat . And that 's really , really a problem . 
So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate , I really started focusing on what we would teach them . 
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region . 
And clearly , with what 's going on with fossil fuel usage , or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away , as oil hits its peak oil , you know , we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should , or could , be moving food 1,500 miles before we eat it . 
So we talked to kids about that , and we really start to feed kids regional food . 
And then we talk about organic food . 
Now , most school districts ca n't really afford organic food , but we , as a nation , have to start thinking about consuming , growing and feeding our children food that 's not chock - full of chemicals . 
We ca n't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones . 
We ca n't keep doing that . 
You know , it does n't work . 
And the results of that are kids getting sick . 
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics . 
Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America is consumed in animal husbandry . 
We are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day . 
Seventy percent -- it 's unbelievable . 
And the result of it is , we have diseases . 
We have things like E. coli that we ca n't fix , that we ca n't make kids better when they get sick . 
And , you know , certainly antibiotics have been over - prescribed , but it 's an issue in the food supply . 
One of my favorite facts is that U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year . 
That means every one of us , and our children , consumes what would equal a five - pound bag -- those bags you have at home . If I had one here and ripped it open , and that pile I would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply , because of the way we consume produce in America . 
The USDA allows these antibiotics , these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply , and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine . 
Okay , we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT , but we know it was n't good for you and me . 
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply . 
And that has to change , you know . 
The USDA can not be seen as the be - all and end - all of what we feed our kids and what 's allowed . 
We can not believe that they have our best interests at heart . 
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food . 
That 's what I really try and get people to understand . 
I really try and teach it to kids . I think it 's the most important . 
It 's consuming food in a way in which we 'll still have a planet , in which kids will grow up to be healthy , and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we 're seeing . 
It really is just a new idea . 
I mean , people toss around sustainability , but we have to figure out what sustainability is . 
In less than 200 years , you know , just in a few generations , we 've gone from being 200 -- being 100 percent , 95 percent farmers to less than 2 percent of farmers . 
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers -- 2.1 million prisoners , 1.9 million farmers . 
And we spend 35,000 dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison , and school districts spend 500 dollars a year feeding a child . 
It 's no wonder , you know , we have criminals . 
And what 's happening is , we 're getting sick . 
We 're getting sick and our kids are getting sick . 
It is about what we feed them . 
What goes in is what we are . 
We really are what we eat . 
And if we continue down this path , if we continue to feed kids bad food , if we continue not to teach them what good food is , what 's going to happen ? You know , what is going to happen ? 
What 's going to happen to our whole medical system ? 
What 's going to happen is , we 're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own . 
The CDC , the Center for Disease Control , has said , of the children born in the year 2000 -- those seven- and eight - year - olds today -- one out of every three Caucasians , one out of every two African - Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime . 
And if that 's not enough , they 've gone on to say , most before they graduate high school . 
This means that 40 or 45 percent of all school - aged children could be insulin - dependent within a decade . Within a decade . 
What 's going to happen ? 
Well , the CDC has gone further to say that those children born in the year 2000 could be the first generation in our country 's history to die at a younger age than their parents . 
And it 's because of what we feed them . 
Because eight - year - olds do n't get to decide -- and if they do , you should be in therapy . 
You know , we are responsible for what kids eat . 
But oops , maybe they 're responsible for what kids eat . 
Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year marketing non - nutrient foods to kids . 
20 billion dollars a year . 10,000 ads most kids see . 
They spend 500 dollars for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods that kids should n't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy , nutritious food . 
The result of which is kids think they 're going to die if they do n't have chicken nuggets . 
You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more , and more , and more . 
This is the USDA portion size , that little , tiny thing . 
And the one over there , that 's bigger than my head , is what McDonald 's and Burger King and those big companies think we should eat . 
And why can they serve that much ? 
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers ? 
It 's because of the way the government commodifies food , and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non - nutrient foods really , really cheap . 
Which is why I say it 's a social justice issue . 
Now , I said I 'm doing this in Berkeley , and you might think , " Oh , Berkeley . Of course you can do it in Berkeley . " 
Well , this is the food I found 24 months ago . 
This is not even food . 
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids : Extremo Burritos , corn dogs , pizza pockets , grilled cheese sandwiches . 
Everything came in plastic , in cardboard . 
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter . 
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher , because if it did n't come in a can , it came frozen in a box . 
The USDA allows this . 
The USDA allows all of this stuff . 
In case you ca n't tell , that 's , like , pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes . 
Chicken nuggets , Tater Tots , chocolate milk with high fructose , canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal . 
That 's what the government says is okay to feed our kids . 
It ai n't okay . You know what ? It is not okay . 
And we , all of us , have to understand that this is about us , that we can make a difference here . 
Now I do n't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets , but I 'm sure you 're rich if you did . 
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart , a giraffe , a star ? 
Well , Tyson did , because there 's no chicken in the chicken . 
And that they could figure it out , that we could sell this stuff to kids . 
You know , what 's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken ? 
But this is what most schools serve . 
In fact , this may be what a lot of parents serve , as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve . 
We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food . 
We really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe . 
You know , that vegetables are actually colorful , that they have flavor , that carrots grow in the ground , that strawberries grow in the ground . 
There 's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush . 
You know , we have to change the way we teach kids about these things . 
There 's a lot of stuff we can do . There 's a lot of schools doing farm - to - school programs . There 's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools . 
Now , in Berkeley , we 've gone totally fresh . 
We have no high - fructose corn syrup , no trans fats , no processed foods . 
We 're cooking from scratch every day . 
We have 25 percent of our -- thank you -- 25 percent of our stuff is organic and local . We cook . 
Those are my hands . I get up at 4 a.m. 
every day and go cook the food for the kids , because this is what we need to do . 
We ca n't keep serving kids processed crap , full of chemicals , and expect these are going to be healthy citizens . 
You 're not going to get the next generation , or the generation after , to be able to think like this if they 're not nourished . 
If they 're eating chemicals all the time , they 're not going to be able to think . 
They 're not going to be smart . 
You know what ? They 're just going to be sick . 
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that , you know , this was all pretty amazing to people , very , very different , and I needed to market it . 
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent . 
And these calendars really started to lay out my program . 
Now I 'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district . 
So this is a typical menu . 
This is what we 're serving this week at the schools . 
And you see these recipes on the side ? 
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes . 
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes . 
They also may be growing them . And we serve them in the cafeterias . 
If we 're going to change children 's relationship to food , it 's delicious , nutritious food in the cafeterias , hands - on experience -- you 're looking in cooking and gardening classes -- and academic curriculum to tie it all together . 
Now you 've probably garnered that I do n't love the USDA , and I do n't have any idea what to do with their pyramid , this upside - down pyramid with a rainbow over the top , I do n't know . 
You know , run up into the end of the rainbow , I do n't know what you do with it . So , I came up with my own . 
This is available on my website in English and Spanish , and it 's a visual way to talk to kids about food . 
The really tiny hamburger , the really big vegetables . 
We have to start changing this . 
We have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference . 
We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools . 
And why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation , maybe two , of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food , one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer . 
What are kids learning ? Where is the family time ? 
Where is socialization ? Where is discussion ? 
Where is learning to talk ? 
You know , we have to change it . 
I work with kids a lot . These are kids I work with in Harlem . 
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating . 
We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts are n't breakfast . 
We have to teach kids that if they 're on a diet of refined sugar , they go up and down , just like if they 're on a diet of crack . 
And we have to pull it all together . We have composting in all of our schools . 
We have recycling in all of our schools . 
You know , the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important , we have to teach kids about in school . 
It has to be so much a part of them that they really get it . 
Because , you know what , many of us are sort of at the end of our careers , and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids , the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet . 
One of the things I do a lot is public - private partnerships . 
I work with private companies who are willing to do R & D with me , who are willing to do distribution for me , who are really willing to work to go into schools . 
Schools are underfunded . 
Most schools in America spend less than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child . 
That comes down to under five dollars an hour . 
Most of you spend 10 , 15 dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them . 
So we 're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system . 
And if we 're going to change it , and change how we feed kids , we really have to rethink that . 
So , public and private partnerships , advocacy groups , working with foundations . 
In our school district , the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services . And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent , we could start to really fix this program . 
We really need to change it . 
It 's going to take more money . 
Of course , it 's not all about food ; it 's also about kids getting exercise . 
And one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch . 
It 's sort of this " duh " thing . 
You know , if you have kids coming into lunch and all they 're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess , you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside . 
And then , at one in the afternoon , they 're totally crashing . 
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up , because they have n't had lunch . 
So if the only thing they 'd have to do after lunch is go to class , believe me , they 're going to sit there and eat their lunch . 
We need to -- we need to educate . 
We need to educate the kids . 
We need to educate the staff . 
I had 90 employees . 
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could . 
And , you know , I 'm not that better off now . 
But we really have to educate . 
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again , because , of course , they do n't -- because we 've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long . 
We need 40-minute lunches -- most schools have 20-minute lunches -- and lunches that are time - appropriate . 
There was just a big study done , and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning . 
That is not lunchtime . 
You know , it 's crazy . It 's crazy what we 're doing . 
And just remember , at very least tacitly , this is what we 're teaching children as what they should be doing . 
I think if we 're going to fix this , one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program . 
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA , I think it should be under CDC . 
If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative , and we started thinking about food as health , then I think we would n't have corn dogs as lunch . 
Okay , Finance 101 on this , and this -- I 'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece , because I think this is something we all have to understand . 
The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars feeding 30 million children a year . 
That number probably needs to double . 
People say , " Oh my God , where are we going to get 8 billion ? " 
In this country , we 're spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food . 
We spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids . 
We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables , which is why we need all the diet aids . 
We spend 200 billion dollars a year on diet - related illness today , with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes . 
200 billion . 
So you know what , when we talk about needing 8 billion more , it 's not a lot . 
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that 's what the government allocates for lunch . 
Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead . 
That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools , 80 to 90 cents . In L.A. , it 's 56 cents . 
So we 're spending less than a dollar , OK , on lunch . 
Now I do n't know about you , but I go to Starbucks and Pete 's and places like that , and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars . 
One gourmet coffee , one , is more -- we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools . 
You know what ? We should be ashamed . 
We , as a country , should be ashamed at that . 
The richest country . 
In our country , it 's the kids that need it the most , who get this really , really lousy food . 
It 's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that ca n't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food . 
And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick . 
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of . 
We can all make a difference . 
That every single one of us , whether we have children , whether we care about children , whether we have nieces or nephews , or anything -- that we can make a difference . 
Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids , whether you take your kids , or grandchildren , or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers ' market . Just do tastings with them . 
Sit down and care . 
And on the macro level , we 're in what seems to be a 19-month presidential campaign , and of all the things we 're asking all of these potential leaders , what about asking for the health of our children ? 
Thank you .

It ’s an unfortunate reality in nearly every major city — road congestion , especially during rush hours . Jonas Eliasson reveals how subtly nudging just a small percentage of drivers to stay off major roads can make traffic jams a thing of the past . 
cars , transportation

Jonas Eliasson : How to solve traffic jams 
Hi . I 'm here to talk about congestion , namely road congestion . 
Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon . 
It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world , which is a little bit surprising when you think about it . 
I mean , think about how different cities are , actually . 
I mean , you have the typical European cities , with a dense urban core , good public transportation mostly , not a lot of road capacity . 
But then , on the other hand , you have the American cities . 
It 's moving by itself , okay . 
Anyway , the American cities : lots of roads dispersed over large areas , almost no public transportation . 
And then you have the emerging world cities , with a mixed variety of vehicles , mixed land - use patterns , also rather dispersed but often with a very dense urban core . 
And traffic planners all around the world have tried lots of different measures : dense cities or dispersed cities , lots of roads or lots of public transport or lots of bike lanes or more information , or lots of different things , but nothing seems to work . 
But all of these attempts have one thing in common . 
They 're basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving . 
They 're essentially , to a point , attempts at planning what other people should do , planning their life for them . 
Now , planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do , and let me tell you a story . 
Back in 1989 , when the Berlin Wall fell , an urban planner in London got a phone call from a colleague in Moscow saying , basically , " Hi , this is Vladimir . I 'd like to know , who 's in charge of London 's bread supply ? " 
And the urban planner in London goes , " What do you mean , who 's in charge of London 's — I mean , no one is in charge . " 
" Oh , but surely someone must be in charge . 
I mean , it 's a very complicated system . Someone must control all of this . " 
" No . No . No one is in charge . 
I mean , it basically -- I have n't really thought of it . 
It basically organizes itself . " 
It organizes itself . 
That 's an example of a complex social system which has the ability of self - organizing , and this is a very deep insight . 
When you try to solve really complex social problems , the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives . 
You do n't plan the details , and people will figure out what to do , how to adapt to this new framework . 
And let 's now look at how we can use this insight to combat road congestion . 
This is a map of Stockholm , my hometown . 
Now , Stockholm is a medium - sized city , roughly two million people , but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges , old bridges -- which means lots of road congestion . 
And these red dots show the most congested parts , which are the bridges that lead into the inner city . 
And then someone came up with the idea that , apart from good public transport , apart from spending money on roads , let 's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks . 
Now , one or two euros , that is n't really a lot of money , I mean compared to parking charges and running costs , etc . , so you would probably expect that car drivers would n't really react to this fairly small charge . 
You would be wrong . 
One or two euros was enough to make 20 percent of cars disappear from rush hours . 
Now , 20 percent , well , that 's a fairly huge figure , you might think , but you 've still got 80 percent left of the problem , right ? 
Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic . 
Now , that 's also wrong , because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really , really rapidly . 
But fortunately , it also works the other way around . 
If you can reduce traffic even somewhat , then congestion will go down much faster than you might think . 
Now , congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm on January 3 , 2006 , and the first picture here is a picture of Stockholm , one of the typical streets , January 2 . 
The first day with the congestion charges looked like this . 
This is what happens when you take away 20 percent of the cars from the streets . 
You really reduce congestion quite substantially . 
But , well , as I said , I mean , car drivers adapt , right ? 
So after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges . 
Wrong again . It 's now six and a half years ago since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm , and we basically have the same low traffic levels still . 
But you see , there 's an interesting gap here in the time series in 2007 . 
Well , the thing is that , the congestion charges , they were introduced first as a trial , so they were introduced in January and then abolished again at the end of July , followed by a referendum , and then they were reintroduced again in 2007 , which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity . 
I mean , this was a really fun experiment to start with , and we actually got to do it twice . 
And personally , I would like to do this every once a year or so , but they wo n't let me do that . 
But it was fun anyway . 
So , we followed up . What happened ? 
This is the last day with the congestion charges , July 31 , and you see the same street but now it 's summer , and summer in Stockholm is a very nice and light time of the year , and the first day without the congestion charges looked like this . 
All the cars were back again , and you even have to admire the car drivers . They adapt so extremely quickly . 
The first day they all came back . 
And this effect hanged on . So 2007 figures looked like this . 
Now these traffic figures are really exciting and a little bit surprising and very useful to know , but I would say that the most surprising slide here I 'm going to show you today is not this one . It 's this one . 
This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm , and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced in the beginning of Spring 2006 , people were fiercely against it . 
Seventy percent of the population did n't want this . 
But what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect , that people hated it more and more . 
No , on the contrary , they changed , up to a point where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges , meaning that -- I mean , let me repeat that : 70 percent of the population in Stockholm want to keep a price for something that used to be free . 
Okay . So why can that be ? Why is that ? 
Well , think about it this way . Who changed ? 
I mean , the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared , surely they must be discontent in a way . 
And where did they go ? If we can understand this , then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this . 
Well , so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services , and tried to figure out who changed , and where did they go ? 
And it turned out that they do n't know themselves . 
For some reason , the car drivers are -- they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do . 
And why is that ? It 's because that travel patterns are much less stable than you might think . 
Each day , people make new decisions , and people change and the world changes around them , and each day all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly away from rush hour car driving in a way that people do n't even notice . 
They 're not even aware of this themselves . 
And the other question , who changed their mind ? 
Who changed their opinion , and why ? 
So we did another interview survey , tried to figure out why people changed their mind , and what type of group changed their minds ? 
And after analyzing the answers , it turned out that more than half of them believe that they have n't changed their minds . 
They 're actually confident that they have liked congestion pricing all along . 
Which means that we are now in a position where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon with 20 percent , and reduced congestion by enormous numbers , and people are n't even aware that they have changed , and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along . 
This is the power of nudges when trying to solve complex social problems , and when you do that , you should n't try to tell people how to adapt . 
You should just nudge them in the right direction . 
And if you do it right , people will actually embrace the change , and if you do it right , people will actually even like it . 
Thank you .

Monika Bulaj : The hidden light of Afghanistan 
My travels to Afghanistan began many , many years ago on the eastern border of my country , my homeland , Poland . 
I was walking through the forests of my grandmother 's tales . 
A land where every field hides a grave , where millions of people have been deported or killed in the 20th century . 
Behind the destruction , I found a soul of places . 
I met humble people . 
I heard their prayer and ate their bread . 
Then I have been walking East for 20 years -- from Eastern Europe to Central Asia -- through the Caucasus Mountains , Middle East , North Africa , Russia . 
And I ever met more humble people . 
And I shared their bread and their prayer . 
This is why I went to Afghanistan . 
One day , I crossed the bridge over the Oxus River . 
I was alone on foot . 
And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me that he forgot to stamp my passport . 
But he gave me a cup of tea . 
And I understood that his surprise was my protection . 
So I have been walking and traveling , by horses , by yak , by truck , by hitchhiking , from Iran 's border to the bottom , to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor . 
And in this way I could find noor , the hidden light of Afghanistan . 
My only weapon was my notebook and my Leica . 
I heard prayers of the Sufi -- humble Muslims , hated by the Taliban . 
Hidden river , interconnected with the mysticism from Gibraltar to India . 
The mosque where the respectful foreigner is showered with blessings and with tears , and welcomed as a gift . 
What do we know about the country and the people that we pretend to protect , about the villages where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is opium ? 
These are opium - addicted people on the roofs of Kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war . 
These are the nomad girls who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen . 
What do we know about the women 10 years after the war ? 
Clothed in this nylon bag , made in China , with the name of burqa . 
I saw one day , the largest school in Afghanistan , a girls ' school . 
13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground , full of scorpions . 
And their love [ for studying ] was so big that I cried . 
What do we know about the death threats by the Taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh ? 
The region is not secure , but full of the Taliban , and they did it . 
My aim is to give a voice to the silent people , to show the hidden lights behind the curtain of the great game , the small worlds ignored by the media and the prophets of a global conflict . 
Thanks .

When Dave deBronkart learned he had a rare and terminal cancer , he turned to a group of fellow patients online -- and found the medical treatment that saved his life . Now he calls on all patients to talk with one another , know their own health data , and make health care better one e - Patient at a time .

Dave deBronkart : Meet e - Patient Dave 
It 's an amazing thing that we 're here to talk about the year of patients rising . 
You heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases , patients who are saying , " You know what , I know what the odds are , but I 'm going to go look for more information . 
I 'm going to define what the terms of my success are . " 
I 'm going to be sharing with you how four years ago I almost died -- found out I was , in fact , already almost dead . 
And what I then found out about what 's called the e - Patient movement -- I 'll explain what that term means . 
I had been blogging under the name Patient Dave , and when I discovered this , I just renamed myself e - Patient Dave . 
Regarding the word " patient , " when I first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer , I noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who 's not in the room here , somebody out there . 
Some of our talks today , we still act like that . 
But I 'm here to tell you , " patient " is not a third - person word . 
You , yourself , will find yourself in a hospital bed -- or your mother , your child -- there are heads nodding , people who say , " Yes , I know exactly what you mean . " 
So when you hear what I 'm going to talk about here today , first of all , I want to say that I am here on behalf of all the patients that I have ever met , all the ones I have n't met . 
This is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care , in fixing health care . 
One of the senior doctors at my hospital , Charlie Safran , and his colleague , Warner Slack , have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient . 
They have been saying that since the 1970s . 
Now I 'm going to step back in history . 
This is from July , 1969 . 
I was a freshman in college , and this was when we first landed on the Moon . 
And it was the first time we had ever seen from another surface -- that 's the place where you and I are right now , where we live . 
The world was changing . 
It was about to change in ways that nobody could foresee . 
A few weeks later , Woodstock happened . 
Three days of fun and music . 
Here , just for historical authenticity , is a picture of me in that year . 
Yeah , the wavy hair , the blue eyes -- it was really something . 
That Fall of 1969 , the Whole Earth Catalog came out . 
It was a hippie journal of self - sufficiency . 
We think of hippies of being just hedonists , but there 's a very strong component -- I was in that movement -- a very strong component of being responsible for yourself . 
This book 's title 's subtitle is : " Access to Tools . " 
And it talked about how to build your own house , how to grow your own food , all kinds of things . 
In the 1980s , this young doctor , Tom Ferguson , was the medical editor of the Whole Earth Catalog . 
And he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine and health care is taking care of ourselves . 
In fact , he said it was 70 to 80 percent of how we actually take care of our bodies . 
Well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease , the key thing that holds us back is access to information . 
And when the Web came along , that changed everything , because not only could we find information , we could find other people like ourselves who could gather , who could bring us information . 
And he coined this term e - Patients -- equipped , engaged , empowered , enabled . 
Obviously at this stage of life he was in a somewhat more dignified form than he was back then . 
Now I was an engaged patient long before I ever heard of the term . 
In 2006 , I went to my doctor for a regular physical , and I had said , " I have a sore shoulder . " 
Well , I got an X - ray , and the next morning -- you may have noticed , those of you who have been through a medical crisis will understand this . 
This morning , some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition . 
For me , it was 9:00 AM on January 3 , 2007 . 
I was at the office ; my desk was clean ; I had the blue partition carpet on the walls . 
The phone rang and it was my doctor . 
He said , " Dave , I pulled up the X - ray image on the screen on the computer at home . " 
He said , " Your shoulder 's going to be fine , but Dave , there 's something in your lung . " 
And if you look in that red oval , that shadow was not supposed to be there . 
To make a long story short , I said , " So you need me to get back in there ? " 
He said , " Yeah , we 're going to need to do a CT scan of your chest . " 
And in parting I said , " Is there anything I should do ? " 
He said -- think about this one . 
This is the advice your doctor gives you : " just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife . " 
I went in for the CAT scan , and it turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs . 
So at that point we knew that it was cancer . 
We knew it was n't lung cancer . 
That meant it was metastasized from somewhere . 
The question was , where from ? 
So I went in for an ultrasound . 
I got to do what many women have -- the jelly on the belly and bzzzz . 
My wife came with me . 
She 's a veterinarian , so she 's seen lots of ultrasounds . 
I mean , she knows I 'm not a dog . 
But what we saw -- this is an MRI image . 
This is much sharper than an ultrasound would be . 
What we saw in that kidney was that big blob there . 
And there were actually two of these . 
One was growing out the front and it had already erupted , and it latched onto the bowel . 
One was growing out the back , and it attached to the soleus muscle , which is a big muscle in the back that I 'd never heard of , but all of a sudden I cared about it . 
I went home . 
Now I 've been Googling -- I 've been online since 1989 on CompuServe . 
I went home , and I know you ca n't read the details here ; that 's not important . 
My point is I went to a respected medical website , WebMD , because I know how to filter out junk . 
I also found my wife online . 
Before I met her , I went through some suboptimal search results . 
So I looked for quality information . 
There 's so much about trust -- what sources of information can we trust ? 
Where does my body end and an invader start ? 
And cancer , a tumor , is something you grow out of your own tissue . 
How does that happen ? 
Where does medical ability end and start ? 
Well , so what I read on WebMD : " The prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer . 
Almost all patients are incurable . " 
I 've been online long enough to know if I do n't like the first results I get , I go look for more . 
And what I found was on other websites , even by the third page of Google results , " Outlook is bleak " , " Prognosis is grim . " 
And I 'm thinking , " What the heck ? " 
I did n't feel sick at all . 
I mean , I 'd been getting tired in the evening , but I was 56 years old . 
I was slowly losing weight , but for me , that was what the doctor told me to do . 
It was really something . 
And this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug I eventually got . 
Totally by coincidence , there 's that thing in my lung . 
In the left femur , the left thigh bone , there 's another one . 
I had one . My leg eventually snapped . 
I fainted and landed on it , and it broke . 
There 's one in the skull , and then just for good measure , I had these other tumors -- including , by the time my treatment started , one was growing out of my tongue . 
I had kidney cancer growing out of my tongue . 
And what I read was that my median survival was 24 weeks . 
This was bad . 
I was facing the grave . 
I thought , " What 's my mother 's face going to look like on the day of my funeral ? " 
I had to sit down with my daughter and say , " Here 's the situation . " 
Her boyfriend was with her . 
I said , " I do n't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while Dad 's still alive . " 
It 's really serious . 
Because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help , think about this . 
Well , my doctor prescribed a patient community , Acor.org , a network of cancer patients , of all amazing things . 
Very quickly they told me , " Kidney cancer is an uncommon disease . 
Get yourself to a specialist center . 
There is no cure , but there 's something that sometimes works -- it usually does n't -- called high - dosage interleukin . 
Most hospitals do n't offer it , so they wo n't even tell you it exists . 
And do n't let them give you anything else first . 
And by the way , here are four doctors in your part of the United States who offer it and their phone numbers . " 
How amazing is that ? 
Here 's the thing . 
Here we are , four years later : you ca n't find a website that gives patients that information . 
Government - approved , American Cancer Society , but patients know what patients want to know . 
It 's the power of patient networks . 
This amazing substance -- again I mentioned , where does my body end ? 
My oncologist and I talk a lot these days because I try to keep my talks technically accurate . 
And he said , " You know , the immune system is good at detecting invaders -- bacteria coming from outside -- but when it 's your own tissue that you 've grown , it 's a whole different thing . " 
And I went through a mental exercise actually , because I started a patient support community of my own on a website , and one of my friends , one of my relatives actually , said , " Look , Dave , who grew this thing ? 
Are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself ? " 
So we went into it . 
And the story of how all that happens is in this book . 
Anyway , this is the way the numbers unfolded . 
Me being me , I put the numbers from my hospital 's website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet . 
Do n't worry about the numbers . 
You see , that 's the immune system . 
Amazing thing , those two yellow lines are where I got the two doses of interleukin two months apart . 
And look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between . 
Just incredible . 
Who knows what we 'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of it . 
The punch line is that a year and a half later , I was there when this magnificent young woman , my daughter , got married . 
And when she came down those steps , and it was just her and me for that moment , I was so glad that she did n't have to say to her mother , " I wish Dad could have been here . " 
And this is what we 're doing when we make health care better . 
Now I want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care . 
This is Regina Holliday , a painter in Washington D.C. , whose husband died of kidney cancer a year after my disease . 
She 's painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital . 
One of the things that she discovered was that her husband 's medical record in this paper folder was just disorganized . 
And she thought , " You know , if I have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box , why ca n't there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty , every new doctor , the basics about my husband 's condition ? " 
So she painted this medical facts mural with a nutrition label , something like that , in a diagram of him . 
She then , last year , painted this diagram . 
She studied health care like me . 
She came to realize that there were a lot of people who 'd written patient advocate books that you just do n't hear about at medical conferences . 
Patients are such an underutilized resource . 
Well as it says in my introduction , I 've gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data . 
And I actually said at one conference a couple of years ago , " Give me my damn data , because you people ca n't be trusted to keep it clean . " 
And here she has our damned data -- it 's a pun -- which is starting to break out , starting to break through -- the water symbolizes our data . 
And in fact , I want to do a little something improvisational for you here . 
There 's a guy on Twitter that I know , a health IT guy outside Boston , and he wrote the e - Patient rap . 
And it goes like this . 
♫ Gimme my damn data ♫ ♫ I want to be an e - Patient just like Dave ♫ ♫ Gimme my damn data , cuz it 's my life to save ♫ Now I 'm not going to go any further . 
Well thank you . That shot the timing . 
Think about the possibility , why is it that iPhones and iPads advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take care of your family ? 
Here 's a website , VisibleBody.com , that I stumbled across . 
And I thought , " You know , I wonder what my soleus muscle is ? " 
So you can click on things and remove it . 
And I saw , " Aha , that 's the kidney and the soleus muscle . " 
And I was rotating it in 3D and saying , " I understand now . " 
And then I realized it reminded me of Google Earth , where you can fly to any address . 
And I thought , " Why not take this and connect it to my digital scan data and have Google Earth for my body ? " 
What did Google come out with this year ? 
Now there 's Google Body browser . 
But you see , it 's still generic . 
It 's not my data . 
But if we can get that data out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it , the way software innovators like to do , who knows what we 'll be able to come up with . 
One final story : this is Kelly Young , a rheumatoid arthritis patient from Florida . 
This is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks . 
RA patients , as they call themselves -- her blog is RA Warrior -- have a big problem because 40 percent of them have no visible symptoms . 
And that makes it just really hard to tell how the disease is going . 
And some doctors think , " Yeah right , you 're really in pain . " 
Well she found , through her online research , a nuclear bone scan that 's usually used for cancer , but it can also reveal inflammation . 
And she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray . 
So she took it . 
And the radiologist report said , " No cancer found . " 
Well that 's not what he was supposed to do with it . 
So she had it read again , she wanted to have it read again , and her doctor fired her . 
She pulled up the CD . 
He said , " If you do n't want to follow my instructions , go away . " 
So she pulled up the CD of the scan images , and look at all those hot spots . 
And she 's now actively engaged on her blog in looking for assistance in getting better care . 
See , that is an empowered patient -- no medical training . 
We are , you are , the most underused resource in health care . 
What she was able to do was because she had access to the raw data . 
How big a deal was this ? 
Well at TED2009 , Tim Berners - Lee himself , inventor of the Web , gave a talk where he said the next big thing is not to have your browser go out and find other people 's articles about the data , but the raw data . 
And he got them chanting by the end of the talk , " Raw data now . 
Raw data now . " 
And I ask you , three words , please , to improve health care : let patients help . 
Let patients help . 
Let patients help . 
Let patients help . 
Thank you . 
For all the patients around the world watching this on the webcast , God bless you , everyone -- let patients help . 
Host : And bless yourself . Thank you very much .

Around the world right now , one billion people are trapped in poor or failing countries . How can we help them ? Economist Paul Collier lays out a bold , compassionate plan for closing the gap between rich and poor .

Paul Collier on the " bottom billion " 
So , can we dare to be optimistic ? 
Well , the thesis of " The Bottom Billion " is that a billion people have been stuck living in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years , and hence diverging from the rest of mankind . 
And so , the real question to pose is not , " Can we be optimistic ? " 
It 's , " How can we give credible hope to that billion people ? " 
That , to my mind , is the fundamental challenge now of development . 
What I 'm going to offer you is a recipe , a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good , which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self - interest . 
Compassion , because a billion people are living in societies that have not offered credible hope . 
That is a human tragedy . 
Enlightened self - interest , because if that economic divergence continues for another 40 years , combined with social integration globally , it will build a nightmare for our children . 
We need compassion to get ourselves started , and enlightened self - interest to get ourselves serious . 
That 's the alliance that changes the world . 
So , what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion ? 
What can we actually do ? 
Well , a good guide is to think , " What did we do last time the rich world got serious about developing another region of the world ? " 
That gives us , it turns out , quite a good clue , except you have to go back quite a long time . 
The last time the rich world got serious about developing another region was in the late 1940s . 
The rich world was you , America , and the region that needed to be developed was my world , Europe . 
That was post - War Europe . 
Why did America get serious ? 
It was n't just compassion for Europe , though there was that . 
It was that you knew you had to , because , in the late 1940s , country after country in Central Europe was falling into the Soviet bloc , and so you knew you 'd no choice . 
Europe had to be dragged into economic development . 
So , what did you do , last time you got serious ? 
Well , yes , you had a big aid program . Thank you very much . 
That was Marshall aid : we need to do it again . Aid is part of the solution . 
But what else did you do ? 
Well , you tore up your trade policy , and totally reversed it . 
Before the war , America had been highly protectionist . 
After the war , you opened your markets to Europe , you dragged Europe into the then - global economy , which was your economy , and you institutionalized that trade liberalization through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . 
So , total reversal of trade policy . 
Did you do anything else ? 
Yes , you totally reversed your security policy . 
Before the war , your security policy had been isolationist . 
After the war , you tear that up , you put 100,000 troops in Europe for over 40 years . 
So , total reversal of security policy . Anything else ? 
Yes , you tear up the " Eleventh Commandment " -- national sovereignty . 
Before the war , you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct that you were n't even willing to join the League of Nations . 
After the war , you found the United Nations , you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , you found the IMF , you encouraged Europe to create the European Community -- all systems for mutual government support . 
That is still the waterfront of effective policies : aid , trade , security , governments . 
Of course , the details of policy are going to be different , because the challenge is different . 
It 's not rebuilding Europe , it 's reversing the divergence for the bottom billion , so that they actually catch up . 
Is that easier or harder ? 
We need to be at least as serious as we were then . 
Now , today I 'm going to take just one of those four . 
I 'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest , the one that 's just motherhood and apple pie -- governments , mutual systems of support for governments -- and I 'm going to show you one idea in how we could do something to strengthen governance , and I 'm going to show you that that is enormously important now . 
The opportunity we 're going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion , and that is the commodity booms . 
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many , though not all , of the countries of the bottom billion . 
Partly , they 're pumping money in because commodity prices are high , but it 's not just that . There 's also a range of new discoveries . 
Uganda has just discovered oil , in about the most disastrous location on Earth ; Ghana has discovered oil ; Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground . 
So , a mass of new discoveries . 
Between them , these new revenue flows dwarf aid . 
Just to give you one example : Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue . 
The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion . 
So , the flow of resources from the commodity booms to the bottom billion are without precedent . 
So there 's the optimism . 
The question is , how is it going to help their development ? 
It 's a huge opportunity for transformational development . 
Will it be taken ? 
So , here comes a bit of science , and this is a bit of science I 've done since " The Bottom Billion , " so it 's new . 
I 've looked to see what is the relationship between higher commodity prices of exports , and the growth of commodity - exporting countries . 
And I 've looked globally , I 've taken all the countries in the world for the last 40 years , and looked to see what the relationship is . 
And the short run -- say , the first five to seven years -- is just great . 
In fact , it 's hunky dory : everything goes up . 
You get more money because your terms of trade have improved , but also that drives up output across the board . 
So GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic ! That 's the short run . 
And how about the long run ? 
Come back 15 years later . 
Well , the short run , it 's hunky dory , but the long run , it 's humpty dumpty . 
You go up in the short run , but then most societies historically have ended up worse than if they 'd had no booms at all . 
That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go ; it 's a forecast of the consequences , the long - term consequences , for growth of an increase in prices . 
So , what goes wrong ? Why is there this " resource curse , " as it 's called ? 
And again , I 've looked at that , and it turns out that the critical issue is the level of governance , the initial level of economic governance , when the resource booms accrue . 
In fact , if you 've got good enough governance , there is no resource boom . 
You go up in the short term , and then you go up even more in the long term . 
That 's Norway , the richest country in Europe . It 's Australia . It 's Canada . 
The resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance . 
They still go up in the short run . 
That 's what we 're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment . 
The best growth rates they 've had -- ever . 
And the question is whether the short run will persist . 
And with bad governance historically , over the last 40 years , it has n't . 
It 's countries like Nigeria , which are worse off than if they 'd never had oil . 
So , there 's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term , and below which you go down . 
Just to benchmark that threshold , it 's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s . 
So , the question is , are the bottom billion above or below that threshold ? 
Now , there 's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s , and that is the spread of democracy . 
So I thought , well , maybe that is the thing which has transformed governance in the bottom billion . 
Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy . 
So , I looked . Democracy does have significant effects -- and unfortunately , they 're adverse . 
Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies . 
At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research , but -- -- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that . 
Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy : there 's electoral competition , which determines how you acquire power , and there are checks and balances , which determine how you use power . 
It turns out that electoral competition is the thing that 's doing the damage with democracy , whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good . 
And so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances . 
They have n't got them . 
They got instant democracy in the 1990s : elections without checks and balances . 
How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances ? 
In all the societies of the bottom billion , there are intense struggles to do just that . 
The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards , which will be voluntary , but which would spell out the key decision points that need to be taken in order to harness these resource revenues . 
We know these international standards work because we 've already got one . 
It 's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative . 
That is the very simple idea that governments should report to their citizens what revenues they have . 
No sooner was it proposed than reformers in Nigeria adopted it , pushed it and published the revenues in the paper . 
Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked . 
People wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of revenue . 
So , we know it works . What would the content be of these international standards ? 
I ca n't go through all of them , but I 'll give you an example . 
The first is how to take the resources out of the ground -- the economic processes , taking the resources out of the ground and putting assets on top of the ground . 
And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction . 
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment , how they 've been sold over the last 40 years ? 
A company flies in , does a deal with a minister . 
And that 's great for the company , and it 's quite often great for the minister -- -- and it 's not great for their country . 
There 's a very simple institutional technology which can transform that , and it 's called verified auctions . 
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth is of course the treasury -- that is , the British Treasury . 
And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights to third - generation mobile phones by working out what those rights were worth . 
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds . 
Just in time , a set of economists got there and said , " Why not try an auction ? It 'll reveal the value . " 
It went for 20 billion pounds through auction . 
If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10 , think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like . 
When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone , the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team to give expertise on how to conduct auctions . 
There are five such decision points ; each one needs an international standard . 
If we could do it , we would change the world . 
We would be helping the reformers in these societies , who are struggling for change . 
That 's our modest role . We can not change these societies , but we can help the people in these societies who are struggling and usually failing , because the odds are so stacked against them . 
And yet , we 've not got these rules . 
If you think about it , the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch -- nothing . 
Why on Earth are they not there ? 
I realized that the reason they 're not there is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies , politicians will get away with gestures . 
That unless we have an informed society , what politicians do , especially in relation to Africa , is gestures : things that look good , but do n't work . 
And so I realized we had to go through the business of building an informed citizenry . 
That 's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist , and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach . 
However , I have to say , the process of communication does not come naturally to me . 
This is why I 'm on this stage , but it 's alarming . 
I grew up in a culture of self - effacement . 
My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks , and the blog comment said , " Collier is not charismatic -- -- but his arguments are compelling . " 
If you agree with that sentiment , and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry , you will realize that I need you . 
Please , become ambassadors . 
Thank you .

Laparoscopic surgery uses minimally invasive incisions -- which means less pain and shorter recovery times for patients . But Steven Schwaitzberg has run into two problems teaching these techniques to surgeons around the world -- language and distance . He shares how a new technology , which combines video conferencing and a real - time universal translator , could help .

Steven Schwaitzberg : A universal translator for surgeons 
So I want to talk to you about two things tonight . 
Number one : Teaching surgery and doing surgery is really hard . 
And second , that language is one of the most profound things that separate us all over the world . 
And in my little corner of the world , these two things are actually related , and I want to tell you how tonight . 
Now , nobody wants an operation . 
Who here has had surgery ? 
Did you want it ? 
Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation . 
Nobody wants an operation . 
In particular , nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain , that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school , that leave a big scar . 
But if you have to have an operation , what you really want is a minimally invasive operation . 
That 's what I want to talk to you about tonight -- how doing and teaching this type of surgery led us on a search for a better universal translator . 
Now , this type of surgery is hard , and it starts by putting people to sleep , putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen , blowing them up like a balloon , sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen -- it 's dangerous stuff -- and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen . 
So let 's see what it looks like . 
So this is gallbladder surgery . 
We perform a million of these a year in the United States alone . 
This is the real thing . There 's no blood . 
And you can see how focused the surgeons are , how much concentration it takes . 
You can see it in their faces . 
It 's hard to teach , and it 's not all that easy to learn . 
We do about five million of these in the United States and maybe 20 million of these worldwide . 
All right , you 've all heard the term : " He 's a born surgeon . " 
Let me tell you , surgeons are not born . 
Surgeons are not made either . 
There are no little tanks where we 're making surgeons . 
Surgeons are trained one step at a time . 
It starts with a foundation , basic skills . 
We build on that and we take people , hopefully , to the operating room where they learn to be an assistant . 
Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training . 
And when they do all of that for about five years , they get the coveted board certification . 
If you need surgery , you want to be operated on by a board - certified surgeon . 
You get your board certificate , and you can go out into practice . 
And eventually , if you 're lucky , you achieve mastery . 
Now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the United States , SAGES , started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures . 
Now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of Surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified . 
It 's not a lecture , it 's not a course , it 's all of that plus a high - stakes assessment . 
It 's hard . 
Now just this past year , one of our partners , the American College of Surgeons , teamed up with us to make an announcement that all surgeons should be FLS -certified before they do minimally invasive surgery . 
And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada ? 
No , we just said all surgeons . 
So to lift this education and training worldwide is a very large task , something I 'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world . 
SAGES does surgery all over the world , teaching and educating surgeons . 
So we have a problem , and one of the problems is distance . 
We ca n't travel everywhere . 
We need to make the world a smaller place . 
And I think that we can develop some tools to do so . 
And one of the tools I like personally is using video . 
So I was inspired by a friend . 
This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto . 
And he proved that you could actually teach people to do surgery using video conferencing . 
So here 's Allan teaching an English - speaking surgeon in Africa these basic fundamental skills necessary to do minimally invasive surgery . 
Very inspiring . 
But for this examination , which is really hard , we have a problem . 
Even people who say they speak English , only 14 percent pass . 
Because for them it 's not a surgery test , it 's an English test . 
Let me bring it to you locally . 
I work at the Cambridge Hospital . 
It 's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility . 
We have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages , and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital . 
It 's a big labor - intensive effort . 
If you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients -- not just teaching surgeons , just trying to talk to your patients -- there are n't enough translators in the world . 
We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest . 
At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors to people who just got here last week . 
And you have no idea how hard it is to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you ca n't talk to . 
And there is n't always a translator available . 
So we need tools . 
We need a universal translator . 
One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world . 
It 's really about setting up a dialogue . 
We have a lot to learn . 
Here in the United States we spend more money per person for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world . 
Maybe we have something to learn as well . 
So I 'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world . 
This past year I 've been in Latin America , I 've been in China , talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery . 
And everywhere I go the barrier is : " We want this , but we need it in our language . " 
So here 's what we think we want to do : Imagine giving a lecture and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously . 
I want to talk to the people in Asia , Latin America , Africa , Europe seamlessly , accurately and in a cost - effective fashion using technology . 
And it has to be bi - directional . 
They have to be able to teach us something as well . 
It 's a big task . 
So we looked for a universal translator ; I thought there would be one out there . 
Your webpage has translation , your cellphone has translation , but nothing that 's good enough to teach surgery . 
Because we need a lexicon . What is a lexicon ? 
A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain . 
I need to have a health care lexicon . 
And in that I need a surgery lexicon . 
That 's a tall order . We have to work at it . 
So let me show you what we 're doing . 
This is research -- ca n't buy it . 
We 're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator . 
It starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology , we then add another technology to do video conferencing . 
But we do n't have the words yet , so we add a third technology . 
And now we 've got the words , and we can apply the special sauce : the translation . 
We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic . 
We work with a fourth technology . 
And we currently have access to eleven language pairs . 
More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place . 
And I 'd like to show you our prototype of stringing all of these technologies that do n't necessarily always talk to each other to become something useful . 
Narrator : Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery . 
Module five : manual skills practice . 
Students may display captions in their native language . 
Steven Schwaitzberg : If you 're in Latin America , you click the " I want it in Spanish " button and out it comes in real time in Spanish . 
But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time , by using technology in a constructive fashion , you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian -- on and on and on , simultaneously without the use of human translators . 
But that 's the lectures . 
If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning , it 's knowledge and skills . 
The difference in an operation between doing something successfully and not may be moving your hand this much . 
So we 're going to take it one step further ; we 've brought my friend Allan back . 
Allan Okrainec : Today we 're going to practice suturing . 
This is how you hold the needle . 
Grab the needle at the tip . 
It 's important to be accurate . 
Aim for the black dots . 
Orient your loop this way . 
Now go ahead and cut . 
Very good Oscar . I 'll see you next week . 
SS : So that 's what we 're working on in our quest for the universal translator . 
We want it to be bi - directional . 
We have a need to learn as well as to teach . 
I can think of a million uses for a tool like this . 
As we think about intersecting technologies -- everybody has a cell phone with a camera -- we could use this everywhere , whether it be health care , patient care , engineering , law , conferencing , translating videos . 
This is a ubiquitous tool . 
In order to break down our barriers , we have to learn to talk to people , to demand that people work on translation . 
We need it for our everyday life , in order to make the world a smaller place . 
Thank you very much .

Janet Echelman : Taking imagination seriously 
This story is about taking imagination seriously . 
Fourteen years ago , I first encountered this ordinary material , fishnet , used the same way for centuries . 
Today , I 'm using it to create permanent , billowing , voluptuous forms the scale of hard - edged buildings in cities around the world . 
I was an unlikely person to be doing this . 
I never studied sculpture , engineering or architecture . 
In fact , after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven . 
I went off on my own to become an artist , and I painted for 10 years , when I was offered a Fulbright to India . 
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings , I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram . 
The deadline for the show arrived -- my paints did n't . 
I had to do something . 
This fishing village was famous for sculpture . 
So I tried bronze casting . 
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive . 
I went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand . 
I 'd seen it every day , but this time I saw it differently -- a new approach to sculpture , a way to make volumetric form without heavy solid materials . 
My first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen . 
It 's a self - portrait titled " Wide Hips . " 
We hoisted them on poles to photograph . 
I discovered their soft surfaces revealed every ripple of wind in constantly changing patterns . 
I was mesmerized . 
I continued studying craft traditions and collaborating with artisans , next in Lithuania with lace makers . 
I liked the fine detail it gave my work , but I wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in . 
Returning to India to work with those fishermen , we made a net of a million and a half hand - tied knots -- installed briefly in Madrid . 
Thousands of people saw it , and one of them was the urbanist Manual Sola - Morales who was redesigning the waterfront in Porto , Portugal . 
He asked if I could build this as a permanent piece for the city . 
I did n't know if I could do that and preserve my art . 
Durable , engineered , permanent -- those are in opposition to idiosyncratic , delicate and ephemeral . 
For two years , I searched for a fiber that could survive ultraviolet rays , salt , air , pollution , and at the same time remain soft enough to move fluidly in the wind . 
We needed something to hold the net up out there in the middle of the traffic circle . 
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring . 
We had to engineer it to move gracefully in an average breeze and survive in hurricane winds . 
But there was no engineering software to model something porous and moving . 
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for America 's Cup racing yachts named Peter Heppel . 
He helped me tackle the twin challenges of precise shape and gentle movement . 
I could n't build this the way I knew because hand - tied knots were n't going to withstand a hurricane . 
So I developed a relationship with an industrial fishnet factory , learned the variables of their machines , and figured out a way to make lace with them . 
There was no language to translate this ancient , idiosyncratic handcraft into something machine operators could produce . 
So we had to create one . 
Three years and two children later , we raised this 50,000-square - foot lace net . 
It was hard to believe that what I had imagined was now built , permanent and had lost nothing in translation . 
This intersection had been bland and anonymous . 
Now it had a sense of place . 
I walked underneath it for the first time . 
As I watched the wind 's choreography unfold , I felt sheltered and , at the same time , connected to limitless sky . 
My life was not going to be the same . 
I want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world . 
I 'm going to share two directions that are new in my work . 
Historic Philadelphia City Hall : its plaza , I felt , needed a material for sculpture that was lighter than netting . 
So we experimented with tiny atomized water particles to create a dry mist that is shaped by the wind and in testing , discovered that it can be shaped by people who can interact and move through it without getting wet . 
I 'm using this sculpture material to trace the paths of subway trains above ground in real time -- like an X - ray of the city 's circulatory system unfolding . 
Next challenge , the Biennial of the Americas in Denver asked , could I represent the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness in a sculpture ? 
I did n't know where to begin , but I said yes . 
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile and the tsunami that rippled across the entire Pacific Ocean . 
It shifted the Earth 's tectonic plates , sped up the planet 's rotation and literally shortened the length of the day . 
So I contacted NOAA , and I asked if they 'd share their data on the tsunami , and translated it into this . 
Its title : " 1.26 " refers to the number of microseconds that the Earth 's day was shortened . 
I could n't build this with a steel ring , the way I knew . 
Its shape was too complex now . 
So I replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel . 
The sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabric of the city . 
There was no software that could extrude these complex net forms and model them with gravity . 
So we had to create it . 
Then I got a call from New York City asking if I could adapt these concepts to Times Square or the High Line . 
This new soft structural method enables me to model these and build these sculptures at the scale of skyscrapers . 
They do n't have funding yet , but I dream now of bringing these to cities around the world where they 're most needed . 
Fourteen years ago , I searched for beauty in the traditional things , in craft forms . 
Now I combine them with hi - tech materials and engineering to create voluptuous , billowing forms the scale of buildings . 
My artistic horizons continue to grow . 
I 'll leave you with this story . 
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix . 
An attorney in the office who 'd never been interested in art , never visited the local art museum , dragged everyone she could from the building and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture . 
There they were in their business suits , laying in the grass , noticing the changing patterns of wind beside people they did n't know , sharing the rediscovery of wonder . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . Thank you .

Edward Burtynsky photographs the landscape of oil 
I started my journey 30 years ago . 
And I worked in mines . And I realized that this was a world unseen . 
And I wanted , through color and large format cameras and very large prints , to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape , how we use the land . 
And to me this was a key component that somehow , through this medium of photography , which allows us to contemplate these landscapes , that I thought photography was perfectly suited to doing this type of work . 
And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes , it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed . 
Because that is what has changed , is the speed at which we 're taking all our resources . 
And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil . 
And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction , where we 're taking it from the ground , refinement . And that 's one chapter . 
The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it -- our cities , our cars , our motorcultures , where people gather around the vehicle as a celebration . 
And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil , this entropic end , where all of our parts of cars , our tires , oil filters , helicopters , planes -- where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up ? 
And to me , again , photography was a way in which I could explore and research the world , and find those places . 
And another idea that I had as well , that was brought forward by an ecologist -- he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said , well , how much carbon it would take , and how much organic material ? 
It was 23 metric tons for one liter . 
So whenever I fill up my gas , I think of that liter , and how much carbon . 
And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton , but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy . 
From the photosynthetic growth , it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we use , the 30 billion barrels we use per year . 
And that also brought me to the fact that this poses such a risk to our society . 
Looking at 30 billion per year , we look at our two largest suppliers , Saudi Arabia and now Canada , with its dirty oil . 
And together they only form about 15 years of supply . 
The whole world , at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves , only gives us about 45 years . 
So , it 's not a question of if , but a question of when peak oil will come upon us . 
So , to me , using photography -- and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents , our ways of thinking , to begin to deal with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time , how to deal with our energy crisis . 
And I would like to say that , on the other side of it , 30 , 40 years from now , the children that I have , I can look at them and say , " We did everything we possibly , humanly could do , to begin to mitigate this , what I feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time . Thank you .

Neuroscientist and inventor Christopher deCharms demonstrates a new way to use fMRI to show brain activity -- thoughts , emotions , pain -- while it is happening . In other words , you can actually see how you feel .

Christopher deCharms looks inside the brain 
Hi . I 'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back , just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave . 
You can mimic what you can see . 
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm . 
Soon , you 'll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there . 
I 'm going to tell you about that technology . 
People have wanted to look inside the human mind , the human brain , for thousands of years . 
Well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that . 
People envision this as being very difficult . 
You had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream . 
It was terribly dangerous . 
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries . 
But now , we have a real technology to do this . 
We 're going to fly into my colleague Peter 's brain . 
We 're going to do it non - invasively using MRI . 
We do n't have to inject anything . We do n't need radiation . 
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter 's brain -- literally , fly into his body -- but more importantly , we can look into his mind . 
When Peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter 's mind taking place . 
Now you 've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms , that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains . 
What 's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis . 
We 've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds , and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he 's inside the scanner . 
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second . 
If he can see this pattern in his own brain , he can learn how to control it . 
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therapist 's couch , pills and the knife . 
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have . 
We all know that as we form thoughts , they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains . 
Chronic pain is an example . If you burn yourself , you pull your hand away . 
But if you 're still in pain in six months ' or six years ' time , it 's because these circuits are producing pain that 's no longer helping you . 
If we can look at the activation in the brain that 's producing the pain , we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information , and then we can select the areas that produce the pain . 
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep . 
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing . 
What you 're seeing here is , we 've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient . 
This may shock you , but we 're literally reading this person 's brain in real time . 
They 're watching their own brain activation , and they 're controlling the pathway that produces their pain . 
They 're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates . 
As they do it , in the upper left is a display that 's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled . 
When they control their brain , they can control their pain . 
This is an investigational technology , but , in clinical trials , we 're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients . 
This is not " The Matrix . " You can only do this to yourself . You take control . 
I 've seen inside my brain . You will too , soon . 
When you do , what do you want to control ? 
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself , all your experiences . 
These are some of the areas we 're working on today that I do n't have time to go into in detail . 
But I want to leave with you the big question . 
We are the first generation that 's going to be able to enter into , using this technology , the human mind and brain . 
Where will we take it ? 
http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html 
Questions of good and evil , right and wrong are commonly thought unanswerable by science . But Sam Harris argues that science can -- and should -- be an authority on moral issues , shaping human values and setting out what constitutes a good life .

Sam Harris : Science can answer moral questions 
I 'm going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values . 
Now , it 's generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion . 
It 's thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value . 
And , consequently , most people -- I think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , " What is worth living for ? " 
" What is worth dying for ? " 
" What constitutes a good life ? " 
So , I 'm going to argue that this is an illusion -- that the separation between science and human values is an illusion -- and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history . 
Now , it 's often said that science can not give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres . 
It 's often thought that there 's no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be . 
But I think this is quite clearly untrue . 
Values are a certain kind of fact . 
They are facts about the well - being of conscious creatures . 
Why is it that we do n't have ethical obligations toward rocks ? 
Why do n't we feel compassion for rocks ? 
It 's because we do n't think rocks can suffer . And if we 're more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it 's because we think they 're exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering . 
Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects . 
And there 's no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I 've ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes . 
Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death -- either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell -- you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes . 
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true . 
Now , to speak about the conditions of well - being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts . 
We know that it 's possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong -- where mothers can not feed their children , where strangers can not find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately . 
And we know that it 's possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable . 
And we know -- we know -- that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space . 
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ? 
Probably not . 
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not . 
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths . 
And morality relates to these truths . 
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts . 
Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels -- from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements . 
But if we 're going to talk about human well - being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain . 
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain -- whatever happens after death . 
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain . 
So the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains . 
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience , psychology , etc . 
So , what I 'm arguing is that value 's reduced to facts -- to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings . 
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings . 
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well - being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective . 
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well - being that we rarely access , that few people access . 
And these await our discovery . 
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual . 
Perhaps there are other states that we ca n't access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them . 
Now , let me be clear about what I 'm not saying . I 'm not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question . 
I do n't think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran 's nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense . 
But if questions affect human well - being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them . 
And just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future . 
For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin . 
And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year . 
The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you . 
We 're not talking about Connecticut . 
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious . 
The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child -- this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 . 
But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ? 
Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ? 
Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well - being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re - construed . 
And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well - being ? 
Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health . 
The concept of physical health is undefined . 
As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years . 
When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 . 
It 's now around 80 in the developed world . 
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability . 
People will send you donations when you 're in that condition . 
Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous . 
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science . 
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing . 
Now , why would n't this undermine an objective morality ? 
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat . 
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food . 
But there 's nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison . 
The fact that there are many right answers to the question , " What is food ? " 
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition . 
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions . 
So , for instance , if it 's really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there 's no such thing as moral truth . 
Why would we think this ? 
Consider , by analogy , the game of chess . 
Now , if you 're going to play good chess , a principle like , " Do n't lose your Queen , " is very good to follow . 
But it clearly admits some exceptions . 
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do . 
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do . 
And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity . 
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all . 
Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere . 
Consider the great problem of women 's bodies : What to do about them ? 
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up . 
Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as " wrong " in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ? 
And who are we to say , even , that they 're wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ? 
Well , who are we not to say this ? 
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well - being that we have to be non - judgmental about a practice like this ? 
I 'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil -- women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I 'm concerned . 
But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father 's first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ? 
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her . 
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ? 
Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society . 
For instance , this is what it 's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world . 
Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images . 
But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , " Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women 's bodies ? " 
I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ? 
Probably not . OK , so perhaps there 's some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance . 
Perhaps there are many such places -- again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape . 
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak . 
Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another . 
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well - being . 
In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering . 
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue . 
But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values . 
Now , what stands in the way of this ? 
Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular , academic , scientist types . 
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we do n't in any other area of our lives . 
So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness . 
On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women . 
So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one 's time . 
Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , " Well , there 's nothing for the Dalai Lama to be really right about -- really right about -- or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science . 
He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla . 
There 's nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . " 
Notice that we do n't do this in science . 
On the left you have Edward Witten . 
He 's a string theorist . 
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten . 
The other half will tell you they do n't like the question . 
So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said,"String theory is bogus . 
It does n't resonate with me . It 's not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale . 
I 'm not a fan . " 
Well , nothing would happen because I 'm not a physicist ; I do n't understand string theory . 
I 'm the Ted Bundy of string theory . 
I would n't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member . 
But this is just the point . 
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded . 
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise . 
That is what it is for knowledge to count . 
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ? 
How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count ? 
How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ? 
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No . 
How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well - being ? 
So , this , I think , is what the world needs now . 
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts . 
It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it 's possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering . 
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality . 
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing . 
We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology can not be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them . 
It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well - being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes . 
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life . 
And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers . 
Thank you very much . 
Chris Anderson : So , some combustible material there . 
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming - with - rage thing , after as well , some of them . 
Language seems to be really important here . 
When you 're talking about the veil , you 're talking about women dressed in cloth bags . 
I 've lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women . 
And some of them would say something else . They would say , " No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it 's a result of the fact that " -- and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view -- " that male lust is not to be trusted . " 
I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ? 
Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you 're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you do n't veil yourself ? 
And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face -- I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under . 
And so I think we should n't be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it 's 120 degrees out and you 're wearing a full burqa . 
CA : A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress . 
But can you reconcile that ? 
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that does n't become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same . 
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness . 
SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail . 
So , we 're going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we 're going to understand the factors that encourage it -- whether they 're genetic , whether they 're how people talk to one another , whether they 're economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space . 
So , everything is not going to be up for grabs . 
It 's not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well - educated in the context of men who do desire women . 
I mean I do n't think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea -- but at a certain point we 're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them . 
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ? 
And I think there are clearly right answers to that . 
CA : And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ? 
SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system . 
So , you can say like , " Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . " 
If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love . 
But again , then we have to talk about well - being in a larger context . 
It 's all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus . 
CA : Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours . 
We do n't have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED . 
SH : Really an honor . Thank you . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_steinberg_natural_pest_control_using_bugs.html 
At TEDxTelAviv , Shimon Steinberg looks at the difference between pests and bugs -- and makes the case for using good bugs to fight bad bugs , avoiding chemicals in our quest for perfect produce .

Shimon Steinberg : Natural pest control ... using bugs ! 
I 'm a bug lover , myself -- not from childhood , by the way , but rather late . 
When I bachelored , majoring in zoology in Tel Aviv University , I kind of fell in love with bugs . 
And then , within zoology , I took the course or the discipline of entomology , the science of insects . 
And then I thought , myself , how can I be practical or help in the science of entomology ? 
And then I moved to the world of plant protection -- plant protection from insects , from bad bugs . 
And then within plant protection , I came into the discipline of biological pest control which we actually define as the use of living organisms to reduce populations of noxious plant pests . 
So it 's a whole discipline in plant protection that 's aiming at the reduction of chemicals . 
And biological pest control , by the way , or these good bugs that we are talking about , they 've existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years , for a long , long time . 
But only in the last 120 years people started , or people knew more and more how to exploit , or how to use , this biological control phenomenon , or in fact , natural control phenomenon , to their own needs . 
Because biological control phenomenon , you can see it in your backyard . 
Just take a magnifying glass . You see what I have here ? 
That 's a magnifier times 10 . 
Yeah , times 10 . 
Just open it . 
You just twist leaves , and you see a whole new world of minute insects , or little spiders of one millimeter , one and a half , two millimeters long , and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones . 
So this phenomenon of natural control exists literally everywhere . 
Here , in front of this building , I 'm sure . 
Just have a look at the plants . 
So it 's everywhere , and we need to know how to exploit it . 
Well let us go hand by hand and browse through just a few examples . 
What is a pest ? 
What damage [ does ] it actually inflict on the plant ? 
And what is the natural enemy , the biologically controlled agent , or the good bug , that we are talking about ? 
In general , I 'm going to talk about insects and spiders , or mites , let us call them . 
Insects , those six - legged organisms and spiders or mites , the eight - legged organisms . 
Let 's have a look at that . 
Here is a pest , devastating pest , a spider mite , because it does a lot of webbing like a spider . 
You see the mother in between and two daughters , probably on the left and right , and a single egg on the right - hand side . 
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict . 
On your right - hand side you can see a cucumber leaf , and on the middle , cotton leaf , and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings . 
They can literally turn from green to white because of the sucking , piercing mouthparts of those spiders . 
But here comes nature that provides us with a good spider . 
This is a predatory mite -- just as small as a spider mite , by the way , one millimeter , two millimeters long , not more than that , running quickly , hunting , chasing the spider mites . 
And here you can see this lady in action on your left - hand side -- just pierces , sucks the body fluids on the left - hand side of the pest mite . 
And after five minutes , this is what you see : just a typical dead corpse , shriveled , sucked - out , dead corpse of the spider mite , and next to it , two satiated individuals of predatory mites , a mother on the left - hand side , a young nymph on the right - hand side . 
By the way , a meal for them for 24 hours is about five individuals of the spider mites , of the bad mites , or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites . 
By the way , they are hungry always . 
And there is another example : aphids . 
By the way , it 's springtime now in Israel . 
When temperature rises sharply , you can see those bad ones , those aphids , all over the plants , in your hibiscus , in your lantana , in the young , fresh foliage of the spring flush , so - called . 
By the way , with aphids you have only females , like Amazons . 
Females giving rise to females giving rise to other females . 
No males at all . 
Parthenogenesis , [ as it ] was so called . 
And they are very happy with that , apparently . 
Here we can see the damage . 
Those aphids secrete some sticky , sugary liquid called honeydew , and this just globs the upper parts of the plant . 
Here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus , sooty mold , which is covering it . 
And here comes the salvation through this parasitic wasp . 
Here we are not talking about a predator . 
Here we are talking a parasite -- not a two - legged parasite , but an eight - legged parasite , of course . 
This is a parasitic wasp , again , two millimeters long , slender , a very quick and sharp flier . 
And here you can see this parasite in action , like in an acrobatic maneuver . 
She stands vis - a - vis in front of the victim at the right - hand side , bending its abdomen and inserting a single egg , a single egg into the body fluids of the aphid . 
By the way , the aphid tries to escape . 
She kicks and bites and secretes different liquids , but nothing will happen , in fact . 
Only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid . 
And after a few days , depending upon temperature , the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside . 
This is all natural . This is all natural . 
This is not fiction , nothing at all . 
Again , in your backyard , in your backyard . 
But this is the end result . 
This is the end result : Mummies -- M - U - M - M - Y. 
This is the visual result of a dead aphid encompassing inside , in fact , a developing parasitoid that after a few minutes you see halfway out . 
The birth is almost complete . 
You can see , by the way , in different movies , etc . , it takes just a few minutes . 
And if this is a female , she 'll immediately mate with a male and off she goes because time is very short . 
This female can live only three to four days , and she needs to give rise to around 400 eggs . 
That means she has 400 bad aphids to put her eggs into their body fluids . 
And this is of course not the end of it . 
There is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example . 
Again , we 'll start first with the pest : the thrips . 
By the way , all these weird names -- I did n't bother you with the Latin names of these creatures , okay , just the popular names . 
But this is a nice , slender , very bad pest . 
If you can see this , sweet peppers . 
This is not just an exotic , ornamental sweet pepper . 
This is a sweet pepper which is not consumable because it is suffering from a viral disease transmitted by those thrip adults . 
And here comes the natural enemy , minute pirate bug , " minute " because it is rather small . 
Here you can see the adult , black , and two young ones . 
And again , in action . 
This adult pierces the thrips , sucking it within just several minutes , just going to the other prey , continuing all over the place . 
And if we spread those minute pirate bugs , the good ones , for example , in a sweet pepper plot , they go to the flowers . 
And look , this flower is flooded with predatory bugs , with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones , the thrips . 
So this is a very positive situation , by the way . 
No harm to the developing fruit . No harm to the fruit set . 
Everything is just fine under these circumstances . 
But again , the question is , here you saw them on a one - to - one basis -- the pest , the natural enemy . 
What we do is actually this . 
In Northeast Israel , in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu , there is a facility that mass - produces those natural enemies . 
In other words , what we do there , we amplify , we amplify the natural control , or the biological control phenomenon . 
And in 30,000 square meters of state - of - the - art greenhouses , there , we are mass - producing those predatory mites , those minute pirate bugs , those parasitic wasps , etc . , etc . 
Many different parts . 
By the way , they have a very nice landscape -- you see the Jordanian Mountains on the one hand and the Jordan Valley on the other hand , and a good , mild winter and a nice , hot summer , which is an excellent condition to mass - produce those creatures . 
And by the way , mass - production -- it is not genetic manipulation . 
There are no GMOs -- Genetically Modified Organisms -- whatsoever . 
We take them from nature , and the only thing that we do , we give them the optimal conditions , under the greenhouses or in the climate rooms , in order to proliferate , multiply and reproduce . 
And that 's what we get , in fact . 
You see under a microscope . 
You see in the upper left corner , you see a single predatory mite . 
And this is the whole bunch of predatory mites . 
You see this ampoule . You see this one . 
I have one gram of those predatory mites . 
One gram 's 80,000 individuals , 80,000 individuals are good enough to control one acre , 4,000 square meters , of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year . 
And we can produce from this , believe you me , several dozens of kilograms on an annual basis . 
So this is what I call amplification of the phenomenon . 
And no , we do not disrupt the balance . 
On the contrary , because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals . 
Here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals . 
That 's the whole idea . 
And what is the impact ? 
In this table , you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs . 
For example , in Israel , where we employ more than 1,000 hectares -- 10,000 dunams in Israeli terms -- of biological pest controlling sweet pepper under protection , 75 percent of the pesticides were actually reduced . 
And Israeli strawberries , even more -- 80 percent of the pesticides , especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries . 
So the impact is very strong . 
And there goes the question , especially if you ask growers , agriculturists : Why biological control ? 
Why good bugs ? 
By the way , the number of answers you get equals the number of people you ask . 
But if we go , for example , to this place , Southeast Israel , the Arava area above the Great Rift Valley , where the really top - notch -- the pearl of the Israeli agriculture is located , especially under greenhouse conditions , or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to Eilat , you see this just in the middle of the desert . 
And if you zoom in , you can definitely watch this , grandparents with their grandchildren , distributing the natural enemies , the good bugs , instead of wearing special clothes and gas masks and applying chemicals . 
So safety , with respect to the application , this is the number one answer that we get from growers , why biological control . 
Number two , many growers are in fact petrified from the idea of resistance , that the pests will become resistant to the chemicals , just in our case that bacteria becomes resistant to antibiotics . 
It 's the same , and it can happen very quickly . 
Fortunately , in either biological control or even natural control , resistance is extremely rare . 
It hardly happens . 
Because this is evolution , this is the natural ratio , unlike resistance , which happens in the case of chemicals . 
And thirdly , public demand . 
Public demand -- the more the public demands the reduction of chemicals , the more growers become aware of the fact they should , wherever they can and wherever possible , replace the chemical control with biological control . 
Even here , there is another grower , you see , very interested in the bugs , the bad ones and the good ones , wearing this magnifier already on her head , just walking safely in her crop . 
Finally , I want to get actually to my vision , or in fact , to my dream . 
Because , you see , this is the reality . 
Have a look at the gap . 
If we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide , it 's 250 million dollars . 
And look at the overall pesticide industry in all the crops throughout the world . 
I think it 's times 100 or something like that . 
Twenty - five billion . 
So there is a huge gap to bridge . 
So actually , how can we do it ? 
How can we bridge , or let 's say , narrow , this gap in the course of the years ? 
First of all , we need to find more robust , good and reliable biological solutions , more good bugs that we can either mass - produce or actually conserve in the field . 
Secondly , to create even more intensive and strict public demand to reduction of chemicals in the agricultural fresh produce . 
And thirdly , also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry . 
And this gap really narrows . 
Step by step , it does narrow . 
So I think my last slide is : All we are saying , we can actually sing it : Give nature a chance . 
So I 'm saying it on behalf of all the biocontrol petitioners and implementers , in Israel and abroad , really give nature a chance . 
Thank you .

Bruce McCall 's faux nostalgia 
I do n't know what the hell I 'm doing here . 
I was born in a Scots Presbyterian ghetto in Canada , and dropped out of high school . I do n't own a cell phone , and I paint on paper using gouache , which has n't changed in 600 years . 
But about three years ago I had an art show in New York , and I titled it " Serious Nonsense . " 
So I think I 'm actually the first one here -- I lead . 
I called it " Serious Nonsense " because on the serious side , I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when I was a kid . I copied it and I never unlearned it -- it 's the only style I know . And it 's very kind of staid and formal . 
And meanwhile , I use nonsense , as you can see . 
This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors , and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor -- which you ca n't see there . 
This was one of a series called " Zany Afternoons , " which became a book . 
This is a home - built rocket - propelled car . That 's a 1953 Henry J -- I 'm a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in Toledo . 
This is my submission for the L.A. Museum of Film . 
You can probably tell Frank Gehry and I come from the same town . 
My work is so personal and so strange that I have to invent my own lexicon for it . 
And I work a lot in what I call " retrofuturism , " which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow . 
And they 're always wrong , always hilariously , optimistically wrong . 
And the peak time for that was the 30s , because the Depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future ... 
and technology was going to carry us along . 
This is Popular Workbench . Popular science magazines in those days -- I had a huge collection of them from the ' 30s -- all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour -- it 's all going to happen , it 's all going to be wonderful . 
Automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties . 
I was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter , so I have a lot of revenge to take on the subject . 
Detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half . 
This is the ' 58 Bulgemobile : so new , they make tomorrow look like yesterday . 
This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car . 
That 's from a whole catalog -- it 's 18 pages or so -- ran back in the days of the Lampoon , where I cut my teeth . 
Techno - archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened -- for good reason , usually . 
The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based , obviously , on the Hindenburg . 
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man . 
And it carried 56 people at the speed of a Buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark , and it cost twice as much as a first - class cabin on the Normandie to fly it . 
So the Hindenburg was n't , you know , it was inevitable it was going to go . 
This is auto - gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s . 
The auto - gyro could n't wait for the invention of the helicopter , but it should have -- it was n't a big success . 
It 's the only Spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way . 
You needed to know that . 
The flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post - war dream . 
My old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car . 
This is pitched into the future from 1946 , looking at the day all American families have them . 
" There 's Moscow , Shirley . Hope they speak Esperanto ! " 
Faux - nostalgia , which I 'm sort of -- not , say , famous for , but I work an awful lot in it . 
It 's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened . 
Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion -- so I think that ’s a case for serious play . 
This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining , recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s , dining on the wing of a plane . You ca n't see it very well here , but that 's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away . 
This is tank polo in the South Hamptons . 
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . I do a lot of that . 
And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense . 
I think it adds a huge amount . 
Those , for example , are Mark IV British tanks from 1916 . 
They had two machine guns and a cannon , and they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines . 
They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark . 
And they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the Germans were n't going to use gas . 
Happy little story , is n't it ? 
This is Motor Ritz Towers in Manhattan in the 30s , where you drove up to your front door , if you had the guts . 
Anybody who was anybody had an apartment there . 
I managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm . 
And I love cigars -- there 's a cigar billboard down there . 
And faux - nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war . 
This is those wonderful days of the Battle of Britain in 1940 , when a Messerschmitt ME109 bursts into the House of Commons and buzzes around , just to piss off Churchill , who 's down there somewhere . 
It 's a fond memory of times past . 
Hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit , just for the fun of it . This was a piece I did -- a brochure again -- " RMS Tyrannic : The Biggest Thing in All the World . " 
The copy , which you ca n't see because it goes on and on for several pages , says that steerage passengers ca n't get their to bunks before the voyage is over , and it 's so safe it carries no insurance . 
It 's obviously modeled on the Titanic . 
But it 's not a cri de coeur about man 's hubris in the face of the elements . 
It 's just a sick , silly joke . 
Shamelessly cheap is something , I think -- this will wake you up . 
It has no meaning , just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi , and it 's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi . 
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the Lampoon , and I did that , and I thought , " Well , I 'm ashamed . I hope nobody knows it . " 
People wrote in for reprints of that thing . 
Urban absurdism -- that 's what the New Yorker really calls for . 
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers . 
I 've done about 40 of them , and I 'd say 30 of them are based on that concept . 
I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m. , and this steam pouring out of the street , and I thought , " What causes that ? " And that -- who ’s to say ? 
The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it 's a very somber place . 
I thought I could jazz it up a bit , have a little fun with it . 
This is a very un - PC cover . Not in New York . 
I could n't resist , and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying , " This is too serious and solemn to make fun of . You should be ashamed , please apologize on our website . " 
Have n't got around to it yet but -- I may . 
This is the word side of my brain . 
I love the word " Eurotrash . " 
That 's all the Eurotrash coming through JFK customs . 
This was the New York bike messenger meeting the Tour de France . 
If you live in New York , you know how the bike messengers move . 
Except that he 's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do -- and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the Tour de France -- sign of our times , I guess . 
This is the only fashion cover I 've ever done . 
It 's the little old lady that lives in a shoe , and then this thing -- the title of that was , " There Goes the Neighborhood . " 
I do n't know a hell of a lot about fashion -- I was told to do what they call a Mary Jane , and then I got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying : " Put a strap on it " -- " No , do n't put a strap on it " -- " Put a strap on it -- " Do n't put a strap on it " -- because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it 's bad and -- I finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe . 
This is a tiny joke -- E - ZR pass . One letter makes an idea . 
This is a big joke . 
This is the audition for " King Kong . " 
People always ask me , where do you get your ideas , how do your ideas come ? 
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover , in the middle of the night , this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down . 
It was perfectly clear . I did n't do any thinking about it . 
And then when it ran , a lovely lady , an old lady named Mrs. Edgar Rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover , it was so sweet . 
Her former name was Fay Wray , and so that was -- I did n't have the wit to say , " Take the painting . " 
Finally , this was a three - page cover , never done before , and I do n't think it will ever be done again -- successive pages in the front of the magazine . 
It 's the ascent of man using an escalator , and it 's in three parts . 
You ca n't see it all together , unfortunately , but if you look at it enough , you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move . 
Pretty elegant . Nothing like a crash to end a joke . That completes my oeuvre . 
I would just like to add a crass commercial -- I have a kids ' book coming out in the fall called " Marvel Sandwiches , " a compendium of all the serious play that ever was , and it ’s going to be available in fine bookstores , crummy bookstores , tables on the street in October . 
So thank you very much .

Jared Diamond on why societies collapse 
I think all of us have been interested , at one time or another , in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed , such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan , the Easter Islanders , the Anasazi , Fertile Crescent society , Angor Wat , Great Zimbabwe and so on . And within the last decade or two , archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems underlying many of these past collapses . 
But there were also plenty of places in the world where societies have been developing for thousands of years without any sign of a major collapse , such as Japan , Java , Tonga and Tikopea . So evidently , societies in some areas are more fragile than in other areas . 
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile than other societies ? The problem is obviously relevant to our situation today , because today as well , there are some societies that have already collapsed , such as Somalia and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia . There are also societies today that may be close to collapse , such as Nepal , Indonesia and Columbia . 
What about ourselves ? 
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have ? 
Obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor . If anyone tells you that there is a single - factor explanation for societal collapses , you know right away that they 're an idiot . This is a complex subject . 
But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject ? 
In analyzing societal collapses , I 've arrived at a five - point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through to try and understand collapses . And I 'll illustrate that five - point framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society . 
This is a European society with literate records , so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation . 
In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland , settled Greenland , and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed , and every one of them ended up dead . 
Why did they all end up dead ? Well , in my five - point framework , the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts on the environment : people inadvertently destroying the resource base on which they depend . And in the case of the Viking Norse , the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation , which was a particular problem for them because they required forests to make charcoal , to make iron . 
So they ended up an Iron Age European society , virtually unable to make their own iron . A second item on my checklist is climate change . Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter . 
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland , the climate got colder in the late 1300s , and especially in the 1400s . But a cold climate is n't necessarily fatal , because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting Greenland at the same time -- did better , rather than worse , with cold climates . So why did n't the Greenland Norse as well ? 
The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society . And if that friendly support is pulled away , that may make a society more likely to collapse . In the case of the Greenland Norse , they had trade with the mother country -- Norway -- and that trade dwindled : partly because Norway got weaker , partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway . 
The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies . 
In the case of Norse Greenland , the hostiles were the Inuit -- the Eskimos sharing Greenland -- with whom the Norse got off to bad relationships . And we know that the Inuit killed the Norse and , probably of greater importance , may have blocked access to the outer fjords , on which the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year . 
And then finally , the fifth item on my checklist is the political , economic , social and cultural factors in the society that make it more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its environmental problems . In the case of the Greenland Norse , cultural factors that made it difficult for them to solve their problems were : their commitments to a Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals ; their being a competitive - ranked chiefly society ; and their scorn for the Inuit , from whom they refused to learn . So that 's how the five - part framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse . 
What about a society today ? 
For the past five years , I 've been taking my wife and kids to Southwestern Montana , where I worked as a teenager on the hay harvest . And Montana , at first sight , seems like the most pristine environment in the United States . 
But scratch the surface , and Montana suffers from serious problems . 
Going through the same checklist : human environmental impacts ? 
Yes , acute in Montana . Toxic problems from mine waste have caused damage of billions of dollars . 
Problems from weeds , weed control , cost Montana nearly 200 million dollars a year . Montana has lost agricultural areas from salinization , problems of forest management , problems of forest fires . Second item on my checklist : climate change . Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer and drier , but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation from the snow pack , and as the snow is melting -- for example , as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing -- that 's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture . 
Third thing on my checklist : relations with friendlies that can sustain the society . In Montana today , more than half of the income of Montana is not earned within Montana , but is derived from out of state : transfer payments from social security , investments and so on -- which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States . 
Fourth : relations with hostiles . Montanans have the same problems as do all Americans , in being sensitive to problems created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies , and terrorist attacks . And finally , last item on my checklist : question of how political , economic , social , cultural attitudes play into this . Montanans have long - held values , which today seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems . 
Long - held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture , and to no government regulation ; values that worked well in the past , but they do n't seem to be working well today . 
So , I 'm looking at these issues of collapses for a lot of past societies and for many present societies . 
Are there any general conclusions that arise ? 
In a way , just like Tolstoy 's statement about every unhappy marriage being different , every collapsed or endangered society is different -- they all have different details . But nevertheless , there are certain common threads that emerge from these comparisons of past societies that did or did not collapse and threatened societies today . One interesting common thread has to do with , in many cases , the rapidity of collapse after a society reaches its peak . There are many societies that do n't wind down gradually , but they build up -- get richer and more powerful -- and then within a short time , within a few decades after their peak , they collapse . For example , the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building their biggest monuments , and Maya population was greatest . 
Or again , the collapse of the Soviet Union took place within a couple of decades , maybe within a decade , of the time when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power . 
An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish . 
These rapid collapses are especially likely where there 's a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption , or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential . 
In a petri dish , bacteria grow . Say they double every generation , and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty , and then the next generation 's 3/4ths empty , and the next generation half empty . Within one generation after the petri dish still being half empty , it is full . There 's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed . 
So , this is a frequent theme : societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power . 
What it means to put it mathematically is that , if you 're concerned about a society today , you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function . That 's one general theme . A second general theme is that there are many , often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others . Many of those factors are not well understood . For example , why is it that in the Pacific , of those hundreds of Pacific islands , why did Easter Island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation ? 
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental factors -- some , rather subtle ones -- that were working against the Easter Islanders , and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra , latitude , rainfall . Perhaps the most subtle of them is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients which protects island environments in the Pacific is from the fallout of continental dust from central Asia . 
Easter , of all Pacific islands , has the least input of dust from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils . But that 's a factor that we did n't even appreciate until 1999 . 
So , some societies , for subtle environmental reasons , are more fragile than others . And then finally , another generalization . I 'm now teaching a course at UCLA , to UCLA undergraduates , on these collapses of societies . What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is , how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ? 
How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment ? 
What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree ? 
Did n't they see what they were doing ? How could societies not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time ? 
And I would expect that , if our human civilization carries on , then maybe in the next century people will be asking , why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action ? 
It seems incredible in the past . In the future , it 'll seem incredible what we are doing today . And so I 've been trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations about why societies fail to solve their problems -- why they fail to perceive the problems or , if they perceive them , why they fail to tackle them . Or , if they tackle them , why do they fail to succeed in solving them ? 
I 'll just mention two generalizations in this area . 
One blueprint for trouble , making collapse likely , is where there is a conflict of interest between the short - term interest of the decision - making elites and the long - term interest of the society as a whole , especially if the elites are able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their actions . Where what 's good in the short run for the elite is bad for the society as a whole , there 's a real risk of the elite doing things that would bring the society down in the long run . 
For example , among the Greenland Norse -- a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted is more followers and more sheep and more resources to outcompete the neighboring chiefs . And that led the chiefs to do what 's called flogging the land : overstocking the land , forcing tenant farmers into dependency . And that made the chiefs powerful in the short run , but led to the society 's collapse in the long run . 
Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute in the United States today . Especially because the decision makers in the United States are frequently able to insulate themselves from consequences by living in gated compounds , by drinking bottled water and so on . And within the last couple of years , it 's been obvious that the elite in the business world correctly perceive that they can advance their short - term interest by doing things that are good for them but bad for society as a whole , such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron and other businesses . They are quite correct that these things are good for them in the short term , although bad for society in the long term . 
So , that 's one general conclusion about why societies make bad decisions : conflicts of interest . 
And the other generalization that I want to mention is that it 's particularly hard for a society to make quote - unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving strongly held values that are good in many circumstances but are poor in other circumstances . For example , the Greenland Norse , in this difficult environment , were held together for four - and - a - half centuries by their shared commitment to religion , and by their strong social cohesion . But those two things -- commitment to religion and strong social cohesion -- also made it difficult for them to change at the end and to learn from the Inuit . Or today -- Australia . 
One of the things that enabled Australia to survive in this remote outpost of European civilization for 250 years has been their British identity . 
But today , their commitment to a British identity is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt to their situation in Asia . So it 's particularly difficult to change course when the things that get you in trouble are the things that are also the source of your strength . 
What 's going to be the outcome today ? 
Well , all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs going on in the modern world , time bombs that have fuses of a few decades to -- all of them , not more than 50 years , and any one of which can do us in ; the time bombs of water , of soil , of climate change , invasive species , the photosynthetic ceiling , population problems , toxics , etc . , etc . -- listing about 12 of them . And while these time bombs -- none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years , and most of them have fuses of a few decades -- some of them , in some places , have much shorter fuses . At the rate at which we 're going now , the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest within five years . And the Solomon Islands are only one year away from losing their loggable forest , which is their major export . And that 's going to be spectacular for the economy of the Solomons . People often ask me , Jared , what 's the most important thing that we need to do about the world 's environmental problems ? 
And my answer is , the most important thing we need to do is to forget about there being any single thing that is the most important thing we need to do . 
Instead , there are a dozen things , any one of which could do us in . 
And we 've got to get them all right , because if we solve 11 , we fail to solve the 12th -- we 're in trouble . For example , if we solve our problems of water and soil and population , but do n't solve our problems of toxics , then we are in trouble . 
The fact is that our present course is a non - sustainable course , which means , by definition , that it can not be maintained . 
And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades . 
That means that those of us in this room who are less than 50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved , and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see the resolution , but our children and grandchildren certainly will . 
The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms : either we will resolve these non - sustainable time - fuses in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action , or else these conflicts are going to get settled in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely , by war , disease or starvation . But what 's for sure is that our non - sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another in a few decades . In other words , since the theme of this session is choices , we have a choice . Does that mean that we should get pessimistic and overwhelmed ? I draw the reverse conclusion . 
The big problems facing the world today are not at all things beyond our control . Our biggest threat is not an asteroid about to crash into us , something we can do nothing about . 
Instead , all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . And since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . That then means that it 's entirely in our power to deal with these problems . 
In particular , what can all of us do ? For those of you who are interested in these choices , there are lots of things you can do . There 's a lot that we do n't understand , and that we need to understand . And there 's a lot that we already do understand , but are n't doing , and that we need to be doing . Thank you .

Marcel Dicke : Why not eat insects ? 
Okay , I 'm going to show you again something about our diets . 
And I would like to know what the audience is , and so who of you ever ate insects ? 
That 's quite a lot . 
But still , you 're not representing the overall population of the Earth . 
Because there 's 80 percent out there that really eats insects . 
But this is quite good . 
Why not eat insects ? Well first , what are insects ? 
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs . 
And here you see just a selection . 
There 's six million species of insects on this planet , six million species . 
There 's a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects . 
In fact , if we count all the individual organisms , we would come at much larger numbers . 
In fact , of all animals on Earth , of all animal species , 80 percent walks on six legs . 
But if we would count all the individuals , and we take an average weight of them , it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth . 
That means that in terms of biomass , insects are more abundant than we are , and we 're not on a planet of men , but we 're on a planet of insects . 
Insects are not only there in nature , but they also are involved in our economy , usually without us knowing . 
There was an estimation , a conservative estimation , a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year . 
It 's a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the United States for free . 
And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year . 
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars . 
Well we know that that was not a cheap war . 
So insects , just for free , contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude , just for free , without everyone knowing . 
And not only in the States , but in any country , in any economy . 
What do they do ? 
They remove dung , they pollinate our crops . 
A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants . 
They control pests , and they 're food for animals . 
They 're at the start of food chains . 
Small animals eat insects . 
Even larger animals eat insects . 
But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals , still larger animals . 
And at the end of the food chain , we are eating them as well . 
There 's quite a lot of people that are eating insects . 
And here you see me in a small , provincial town in China , Lijiang -- about two million inhabitants . 
If you go out for dinner , like in a fish restaurant , where you can select which fish you want to eat , you can select which insects you would like to eat . 
And they prepare it in a wonderful way . 
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars , locusts , bee pupae -- delicacies . 
And you can eat something new everyday . 
There 's more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe . 
That 's quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we 're eating , like a cow or a pig or a sheep . 
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety . 
And now you may think , okay , in this provincial town in China they 're doing that , but not us . 
Well we 've seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally , but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects , without any exception . 
You 're eating at least 500 grams per year . 
What are you eating ? 
Tomato soup , peanut butter , chocolate , noodles -- any processed food that you 're eating contains insects , because insects are here all around us , and when they 're out there in nature they 're also in our crops . 
Some fruits get some insect damage . 
Those are the fruits , if they 're tomato , that go to the tomato soup . 
If they do n't have any damage , they go to the grocery . 
And that 's your view of a tomato . 
But there 's tomatoes that end up in a soup , and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency , there can be all kinds of things in there , no problem . 
In fact , why would we put these balls in the soup , there 's meat in there anyway ? 
In fact , all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of . 
So anything is a good protein source already . 
Now you may say , " Okay , so we 're eating 500 grams just by accident . " 
We 're even doing this on purpose . 
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or , if you like , Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye . 
The surimi sticks [ of ] crabmeat , or is being sold as crab meat , is white fish that 's being dyed with cochineal . 
Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti . 
It 's being produced in large amounts , 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru , and it 's big business . 
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros . 
One gram of gold is 30 euros . 
So it 's a very precious thing that we 're using to dye our foods . 
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me , for everyone on this Earth . 
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially . 
Where , at the moment , we have something between six and seven billion people , it will grow to about nine billion in 2050 . 
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed , and this is something that worries more and more people . 
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this . 
How are we going to feed this world ? 
And if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent . 
And that 's especially because this world population is increasing , and it 's increasing , not only in numbers , but we 're also getting wealthier , and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat . 
And meat , in fact , is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production . 
Our diet consists , [ in ] some part , of animal proteins , and at the moment , most of us here get it from livestock , from fish , from game . 
And we eat quite a lot of it . 
In the developed world it 's on average 80 kilograms per person per year , which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries , but on average 80 kilograms per person per year . 
In the developing world it 's much lower . 
It 's 25 kilograms per person per year . 
But it 's increasing enormously . 
In China in the last 20 years , it increased from 20 to 50 , and it 's still increasing . 
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average , and a third of the world population is living in China and in India , we 're having an enormous demand on meat . 
And of course , we are not there to say that 's only for us , it 's not for them . 
They have the same share that we have . 
Now to start with , I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world . 
We could do with much , much less -- and I know , I 've been a vegetarian for a long time , and you can easily do without anything . 
You 'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway . 
But then there 's a lot of problems that come with meat production , and we 're being faced with that more and more often . 
The first problem that we 're facing is human health . 
Pigs are quite like us . 
They 're even models in medicine , and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human . 
That means that pigs also share diseases with us . 
And a pig disease , a pig virus , and a human virus can both proliferate , and because of their kind of reproduction , they can combine and produce a new virus . 
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak . 
You get a new disease that can be deadly . 
We eat insects -- they 're so distantly related from us that this does n't happen . 
So that 's one point for insects . 
And there 's the conversion factor . 
You take 10 kilograms of feed , you can get one kilogram of beef , but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat . 
So if you would be an entrepreneur , what would you do ? 
With 10 kilograms of input , you can get either one or nine kg . of output . 
So far we 're taking the one , or up to five kilograms of output . 
We 're not taking the bonus yet . 
We 're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet . 
So that 's two points for insects . 
And there 's the environment . 
If we take 10 kilograms of food -- and it results in one kilogram of beef , the other nine kilograms are waste , and a lot of that is manure . 
If you produce insects , you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce . 
So less waste . 
Furthermore , per kilogram of manure , you have much , much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure than when you have cow manure . 
So you have less waste , and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung . 
So that 's three points for insects . 
Now there 's a big " if , " of course , and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality . 
Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein , or fat , or vitamins , it 's very good . 
In fact , it 's comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment . 
And even in terms of calories , it is very good . 
One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs , or six Big Macs . 
So that 's four points for insects . 
I can go on , and I could make many more points for insects , but time does n't allow this . 
So the question is , why not eat insects ? 
I gave you at least four arguments in favor . 
We 'll have to . 
Even if you do n't like it , you 'll have to get used to this because at the moment , 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock . 
That 's not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding , but it 's also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported . 
We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests , but there 's a limitation very soon . 
And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent , we 're not going to make it that way . 
We could much better change from meat , from beef , to insects . 
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects , so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K. , the USA , the Netherlands , anywhere . 
On the left - hand side , you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night . 
On the right - hand side you see a grasshopper . 
So people there are eating them , not because they 're hungry , but because they think it 's a delicacy . 
It 's just very good food . 
You can vary enormously . 
It has many benefits . 
In fact , we have delicacy that 's very much like this grasshopper : shrimps , a delicacy being sold at a high price . 
Who would n't like to eat a shrimp ? 
There are a few people who do n't like shrimp , but shrimp , or crabs , or crayfish , are very closely related . 
They are delicacies . 
In fact , a locust is a " shrimp " of the land , and it would make very good into our diet . 
So why are we not eating insects yet ? 
Well that 's just a matter of mindset . 
We 're not used to it , and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us . 
That 's why we 're changing the perception of insects . 
And I 'm working very hard with my colleague , Arnold van Huis , in telling people what insects are , what magnificent things they are , what magnificent jobs they do in nature . 
And in fact , without insects , we would not be here in this room , because if the insects die out , we will soon die out as well . 
If we die out , the insects will continue very happily . 
So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects . 
And some might think , well they 're not yet available . 
Well they are . 
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , Marian Peeters , who 's in the picture . 
I predict that later this year , you 'll get them in the supermarkets -- not visible , but as animal protein in the food . 
And maybe by 2020 , you 'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you 're going to eat . 
And they 're being made in the most wonderful ways . 
A Dutch chocolate maker . 
So there 's even a lot of design to it . 
Well in the Netherlands , we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture , and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry . 
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U. 
over to the Hague recently , she went to a high - class restaurant , and they ate insects all together . 
It 's not something that is a hobby of mine . 
It 's really taken off the ground . 
So why not eat insects ? 
You should try it yourself . 
A couple of years ago , we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town , and they ate insects at the same moment , and this was still big , big news . 
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects , because it 's just a normal way of doing . 
So you can try it yourself today , and I would say , enjoy . 
And I 'm going to show to Bruno some first tries , and he can have the first bite . 
Bruno Giussani : Look at them first . Look at them first . 
Marcel Dicke : It 's all protein . 
BG : That 's exactly the same [ one ] you saw in the video actually . 
And it looks delicious . 
They just make it [ with ] nuts or something . 
MD : Thank you .

Tom Wujec demos the 13th - century astrolabe 
As technology progresses , and as it advances , many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent , make us smarter and more connected to the world . 
And what I 'd like to argue is that that 's not necessarily the case , as progress is simply a word for change , and with change you gain something , but you also lose something . 
And to really illustrate this point , what I 'd like to do is to show you how technology has dealt with a very simple , a very common , an everyday question . 
And that question is this . 
What time is it ? What time is it ? 
If you glance at your iPhone , it 's so simple to tell the time . 
But , I 'd like to ask you , how would you tell the time if you did n't have an iPhone ? 
How would you tell the time , say , 600 years ago ? 
How would you do it ? 
Well , the way you would do it is by using a device that 's called an astrolabe . 
So , an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today 's world . 
But , at the time , in the 13th century , it was the gadget of the day . 
It was the world 's first popular computer . 
And it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky . 
So , the different parts of the astrolabe , in this particular type , the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars . 
The plate corresponds to a coordinate system . 
And the mater has some scales and puts it all together . 
If you were an educated child , you would know how to not only use the astrolabe , you would also know how to make an astrolabe . 
And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe , the first technical manual in the English language , was written by Geoffrey Chaucer . 
Yes , that Geoffrey Chaucer , in 1391 , to his little Lewis , his 11-year - old son . 
And in this book , little Lewis would know the big idea . 
And the central idea that makes this computer work is this thing called stereographic projection . 
And basically , the concept is , how do you represent the three - dimensional image of the night sky that surrounds us onto a flat , portable , two - dimensional surface . 
The idea is actually relatively simple . 
Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe , and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere . 
Each point on the surface of the sphere is mapped through the bottom pole , onto a flat surface , where it is then recorded . 
So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device . 
The ecliptic , which is the path of the sun , moon , and planets correspond to an offset circle . 
The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete . 
And the altitude corresponds to the plate system . 
Now , the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection . 
The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems so they fit perfectly . 
There is the position of the sun , moon and planets on the movable rete . 
And then there is their location on the sky as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate . Okay ? 
So how would you use this device ? 
Well , let me first back up for a moment . 
This is an astrolabe . Pretty impressive , is n't it ? 
And so , this astrolabe is on loan from us from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History . 
And you can see the different components . 
This is the mater , the scales on the back . 
This is the rete . Okay . Do you see that ? 
That 's the movable part of the sky . 
And in the back you can see a spider web pattern . 
And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky . 
This is a rule device . And on the back are some other devices , measuring tools and scales , to be able to make some calculations . Okay ? 
You know , I 've always wanted one of these . 
For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper . 
And this one , this is a replica from a 15th - century device . 
And it 's worth probably about three MacBook Pros . 
But a real one would cost about as much as my house , and the house next to it , and actually every house on the block , on both sides of the street , maybe a school thrown in , and some -- you know , a church . 
They are just incredibly expensive . 
But let me show you how to work this device . 
So let 's go to step one . 
First thing that you do is you select a star in the night sky , if you 're telling time at night . 
So , tonight , if it 's clear you 'll be able to see the summer triangle . 
And there is a bright star called Deneb . So let 's select Deneb . 
Second , is you measure the altitude of Deneb . 
So , step two , I hold the device up , and then I sight its altitude there so I can see it clearly now . 
And then I measure its altitude . 
So , it 's about 26 degrees . You ca n't see it from over there . 
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device . 
Deneb is there . I can tell . 
Step four is I then move the rete , move the sky , so the altitude of the star corresponds to the scale on the back . 
Okay , so when that happens everything lines up . 
I have here a model of the sky that corresponds to the real sky . Okay ? 
So , it is , in a sense , holding a model of the universe in my hands . 
And then finally , I take a rule , and move the rule to a date line which then tells me the time here . 
Right . So , that 's how the device is used . 
So , I know what you 're thinking : " That 's a lot of work , is n't it ? Is n't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time ? " 
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time . 
But there is a difference between the two , because with your iPod you can tell -- or your iPhone , you can tell exactly what the time is , with precision . 
The way little Lewis would tell the time is by a picture of the sky . 
He would know where things would fit in the sky . 
He would not only know what time it was , he would also know where the sun would rise , and how it would move across the sky . 
He would know what time the sun would rise , and what time it would set . 
And he would know that for essentially every celestial object in the heavens . 
So , in computer graphics and computer user interface design , there is a term called affordances . 
So , affordances are the qualities of an object that allow us to perform an action with it . 
And what the astrolabe does is it allows us , it affords us , to connect to the night sky , to look up into the night sky and be much more -- to see the visible and the invisible together . 
So , that 's just one use . Incredible , there is probably 350 , 400 uses . 
In fact , there is a text , and that has over a thousand uses of this first computer . 
On the back there is scales and measurements for terrestrial navigation . 
You can survey with it . The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it . 
It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types . 
And it would take a full university course to illustrate it . 
Astrolabes have an incredible history . 
They are over 2,000 years old . 
The concept of stereographic projection originated in 330 B.C. 
And the astrolabes come in many different sizes and shapes and forms . 
There is portable ones . There is large display ones . 
And I think what is common to all astrolabes is that they are beautiful works of art . 
There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just astonishing and remarkable . 
Astrolabes , like every technology , do evolve over time . 
So , the earliest retes , for example , were very simple and primitive . 
And advancing retes became cultural emblems . 
This is one from Oxford . 
And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern is completely symmetrical , and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical , or random sky . 
How cool is that ? This is just amazing . 
So , would little Lewis have an astrolabe ? 
Probably not one made of brass . He would have one made out of wood , or paper . And the vast majority of this first computer was a portable device that you could keep in the back of your pocket . 
So , what does the astrolabe inspire ? 
Well , I think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were , our forebears were , years and years ago . 
It 's just an incredible device . 
Every technology advances . 
Every technology is transformed and moved by others . 
And what we gain with a new technology , of course , is precision and accuracy . 
But what we lose , I think , is an accurate -- a felt sense of the sky , a sense of context . 
Knowing the sky , knowing your relationship with the sky , is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is . 
So , it 's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices . 
And so , what can you learn from these devices ? 
Well , primarily that there is a subtle knowledge that we can connect with the world . 
And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense of how things all fit together , and also how we connect to the world . 
Thanks very much . 
http://www.ted.com/talks/allison_hunt_gets_a_new_hip.html 
When Allison Hunt found out that she needed a new hip -- and that Canada ’s national health care system would require her to spend nearly 2 years on a waiting list -- she took matters into her own hands . 
culture , health care , marketing , medicine , short talk

Allison Hunt gets hip 
Allison Hunt : My three minutes has n't started yet , has it ? 
Chris Anderson : No , you ca n't start the three minutes . 
Reset the three minutes , that 's just not fair . 
AH : Oh my God , it 's harsh up here . 
I mean I 'm nervous enough as it is . 
But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago . 
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery . 
Do you know that surgery ? 
Electric saw , power drill , totally disgusting unless you 're David Bolinsky , in which case it 's all truth and beauty . 
Sure David , if it 's not your hip , it 's truth and beauty . 
Anyway , I did have a really big epiphany around the situation , so Chris invited me to tell you about it . 
But first you need to know two things about me . 
Just two things . 
I 'm Canadian , and I 'm the youngest of seven kids . 
Now , in Canada , we have that great healthcare system . 
That means we get our new hips for free . 
And being the youngest of seven , I have never been at the front of the line for anything . OK ? 
So my hip had been hurting me for years . 
I finally went to the doctor , which was free . 
And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon , also free . 
Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year . 
That is what free gets you . 
I met the surgeon , and he took some free X - rays , and I got a good look at them . And you know , even I could tell my hip was bad , and I actually work in marketing . 
So he said , " Allison , we 've got to get you on the table . 
I 'm going to replace your hip -- it 's about an 18-month wait . " 
18 more months . 
I 'd already waited 10 months , and I had to wait 18 more months . 
You know , it 's such a long wait that I actually started to even think about it in terms of TEDs . 
I would n't have my new hip for this TED . 
I would n't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa . 
I would not have my new hip for TED2008 . 
I would still be on my bad hip . That was so disappointing . 
So , I left his office and I was walking through the hospital , and that 's when I had my epiphany . 
This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line . 
Oh yeah . 
Can I tell you how un - Canadian that is ? 
We do not think that way . 
We do n't talk about it . It 's not even a consideration . 
In fact , when we 're traveling abroad , it 's how we identify fellow Canadians . 
" After you . " " Oh , no , no . After you . " 
Hey , are you from Canada ? " Oh , me too ! Hi ! " 
" Great ! Excellent ! " 
So no , suddenly I was n't averse to butting any geezer off the list . 
Some 70-year - old who wanted his new hip so he could be back golfing , or gardening . 
No , no . Front of the line . 
So by now I was walking the lobby , and of course , that hurt , because of my hip , and I kind of needed a sign . 
And I saw a sign . 
In the window of the hospital 's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said , " Volunteers Needed . " Hmm . 
Well , they signed me up immediately . 
No reference checks . None of the usual background stuff , no . 
They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75 . 
Yeah . They needed some young blood . 
So , next thing you know , I had my bright blue volunteer vest , I had my photo ID , and I was fully trained by my 89-year - old boss . 
I worked alone . 
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop . 
While ringing in hospital staff 's Tic Tacs , I 'd casually ask , " What do you do ? " 
Then I 'd tell them , " Well , I 'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months . 
It 's gon na be so great when the pain stops . Ow ! " 
All the staff got to know the plucky , young volunteer . 
My next surgeon 's appointment was , coincidentally , right after a shift at the gift shop . 
So , naturally , I had my vest and my identification . 
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor 's office . 
And you know , when he walked in , I could just tell that he saw them . 
Moments later , I had a surgery date just weeks away , and a big fat prescription for Percocet . 
Now , word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line . 
And , you know , I 'm not even ashamed of that . 
Two reasons . 
First of all , I am going to take such good care of this new hip . 
But also I intend to stick with the volunteering , which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all . 
Even when a Canadian cheats the system , they do it in a way that benefits society .

At TEDxNASA , Dennis Hong introduces seven award - winnning , all - terrain robots -- like the humanoid , soccer - playing DARwIn and the cliff - gripping CLIMBeR -- all built by his team at RoMeLa , Virginia Tech . Watch to the end to hear the five creative secrets to his lab 's incredible technical success .

Dennis Hong : My seven species of robot 
So , the first robot to talk about is called STriDER . 
It stands for Self - excited Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot . 
It 's a robot that has three legs , which is inspired by nature . 
But have you seen anything in nature , an animal that has three legs ? 
Probably not . So , why do I call this a biologically inspired robot ? How would it work ? 
But before that , let 's look at pop culture . 
So , you know H.G. Wells ' " War of the Worlds , " novel and movie . 
And what you see over here is a very popular video game , and in this fiction they describe these alien creatures that are robots that have three legs that terrorize Earth . 
But my robot , STriDER , does not move like this . 
So , this is an actual dynamic simulation animation . 
I 'm just going to show you how the robot works . 
It flips its body 180 degrees and it swings its leg between the two legs and catches the fall . 
So , that 's how it walks . But when you look at us human being , bipedal walking , what you 're doing is you 're not really using a muscle to lift your leg and walk like a robot . Right ? 
What you 're doing is you really swing your leg and catch the fall , stand up again , swing your leg and catch the fall . 
You 're using your built - in dynamics , the physics of your body , just like a pendulum . 
We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion . 
What you 're doing is , when you stand up , potential energy to kinetic energy , potential energy to kinetic energy . 
It 's a constantly falling process . 
So , even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this , really , we were inspired by biology and applying the principles of walking to this robot . Thus it 's a biologically inspired robot . 
What you see over here , this is what we want to do next . 
We want to fold up the legs and shoot it up for long - range motion . 
And it deploys legs -- it looks almost like " Star Wars " -- when it lands , it absorbs the shock and starts walking . 
What you see over here , this yellow thing , this is not a death ray . 
This is just to show you that if you have cameras or different types of sensors -- because it is tall , it 's 1.8 meters tall -- you can see over obstacles like bushes and those kinds of things . 
So we have two prototypes . 
The first version , in the back , that 's STriDER I. 
The one in front , the smaller , is STriDER II . 
The problem that we had with STriDER I is it was just too heavy in the body . We had so many motors , you know , aligning the joints , and those kinds of things . 
So , we decided to synthesize a mechanical mechanism so we could get rid of all the motors , and with a single motor we can coordinate all the motions . 
It 's a mechanical solution to a problem , instead of using mechatronics . 
So , with this now the top body is light enough . So , it 's walking in our lab ; this was the very first successful step . 
It 's still not perfected -- its coffee falls down -- so we still have a lot of work to do . 
The second robot I want to talk about is called IMPASS . 
So , it 's a wheel - leg hybrid robot . 
So , think of a rimless wheel or a spoke wheel , but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub ; so , it 's a wheel - leg hybrid . 
We are literally re - inventing the wheel here . 
Let me demonstrate how it works . 
So , in this video we 're using an approach called the reactive approach . 
Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet , it 's trying to walk over a changing terrain , a soft terrain where it pushes down and changes . 
And just by the tactile information , it successfully crosses over these type of terrain . 
But , when it encounters a very extreme terrain , in this case , this obstacle is more than three times the height of the robot , Then it switches to a deliberate mode , where it uses a laser range finder , and camera systems , to identify the obstacle and the size , and it plans , carefully plans the motion of the spokes and coordinates it so that it can show this kind of very very impressive mobility . 
You probably have n't seen anything like this out there . 
This is a very high mobility robot that we developed called IMPASS . 
Ah , is n't that cool ? 
When you drive your car , when you steer your car , you use a method called Ackermann steering . 
The front wheels rotate like this . 
For most small wheeled robots , they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turns the opposite direction . 
For IMPASS , we can do many , many different types of motion . 
For example , in this case , even though the left and right wheel is connected with a single axle rotating at the same angle of velocity . 
We just simply change the length of the spoke . 
It affects the diameter and then can turn to the left , turn to the right . 
So , these are just some examples of the neat things that we can do with IMPASS . 
This robot is called CLIMBeR : Cable - suspended Limbed Intelligent Matching Behavior Robot . 
So , I 've been talking to a lot of NASA JPL scientists -- at JPL they are famous for the Mars rovers -- and the scientists , geologists always tell me that the real interesting science , the science - rich sites , are always at the cliffs . 
But the current rovers can not get there . 
So , inspired by that we wanted to build a robot that can climb a structured cliff environment . 
So , this is CLIMBeR. 
So , what it does , it has three legs . It 's probably difficult to see , but it has a winch and a cable at the top -- and it tries to figure out the best place to put its foot . 
And then once it figures that out in real time , it calculates the force distribution : how much force it needs to exert to the surface so it does n't tip and does n't slip . 
Once it stabilizes that , it lifts a foot , and then with the winch it can climb up these kinds of thing . 
Also for search and rescue applications as well . 
Five years ago I actually worked at NASA JPL during the summer as a faculty fellow . 
And they already had a six legged robot called LEMUR . 
So , this is actually based on that . This robot is called MARS : Multi - Appendage Robotic System . So , it 's a hexapod robot . 
We developed our adaptive gait planner . 
We actually have a very interesting payload on there . 
The students like to have fun . And here you can see that it 's walking over unstructured terrain . 
It 's trying to walk on the coarse terrain , sandy area , but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand the foot 's soil sinkage model changes . 
So , it tries to adapt its gait to successfully cross over these kind of things . 
And also , it does some fun stuff , as can imagine . 
We get so many visitors visiting our lab . 
So , when the visitors come , MARS walks up to the computer , starts typing " Hello , my name is MARS . " 
Welcome to RoMeLa , the Robotics Mechanisms Laboratory at Virginia Tech . 
This robot is an amoeba robot . 
Now , we do n't have enough time to go into technical details , I 'll just show you some of the experiments . 
So , this is some of the early feasibility experiments . 
We store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move . 
Or use an active tension cords to make it move forward and backward . It 's called ChIMERA . 
We also have been working with some scientists and engineers from UPenn to come up with a chemically actuated version of this amoeba robot . 
We do something to something And just like magic , it moves . The blob . 
This robot is a very recent project . It 's called RAPHaEL . 
Robotic Air Powered Hand with Elastic Ligaments . 
There are a lot of really neat , very good robotic hands out there in the market . 
The problem is they 're just too expensive , tens of thousands of dollars . 
So , for prosthesis applications it 's probably not too practical , because it 's not affordable . 
We wanted to go tackle this problem in a very different direction . 
Instead of using electrical motors , electromechanical actuators , we 're using compressed air . 
We developed these novel actuators for joints . 
It is compliant . You can actually change the force , simply just changing the air pressure . 
And it can actually crush an empty soda can . 
It can pick up very delicate objects like a raw egg , or in this case , a lightbulb . 
The best part , it took only $ 200 dollars to make the first prototype . 
This robot is actually a family of snake robots that we call HyDRAS , Hyper Degrees - of - freedom Robotic Articulated Serpentine . 
This is a robot that can climb structures . 
This is a HyDRAS 's arm . 
It 's a 12 degrees of freedom robotic arm . 
But the cool part is the user interface . 
The cable over there , that 's an optical fiber . 
And this student , probably the first time using it , but she can articulate it many different ways . 
So , for example in Iraq , you know , the war zone , there is roadside bombs . Currently you send these remotely controlled vehicles that are armed . 
It takes really a lot of time and it 's expensive to train the operator to operate this complex arm . 
In this case it 's very intuitive ; this student , probably his first time using it , doing very complex manipulation tasks , picking up objects and doing manipulation , just like that . Very intuitive . 
Now , this robot is currently our star robot . 
We actually have a fan club for the robot , DARwIn : Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence . 
As you know , we are very interested in humanoid robot , human walking , so we decided to build a small humanoid robot . 
This was in 2004 ; at that time , this was something really , really revolutionary . 
This was more of a feasibility study : What kind of motors should we use ? 
Is it even possible ? What kinds of controls should we do ? 
So , this does not have any sensors . 
So , it 's an open loop control . 
For those who probably know , if you do n't have any sensors and there are any disturbances , you know what happens . 
So , based on that success , the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics . 
And thus , DARwIn I was born in 2005 . 
It stands up , it walks -- very impressive . 
However , still , as you can see , it has a cord , umbilical cord . So , we 're still using an external power source and external computation . 
So , in 2006 , now it 's really time to have fun . 
Let 's give it intelligence . We give it all the computing power it needs : a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip , two FireWire cameras , rate gyros , accelerometers , four force sensors on the foot , lithium polymer batteries . 
And now DARwIn II is completely autonomous . 
It is not remote controlled . 
There are no tethers . It looks around , searches for the ball , looks around , searches for the ball , and it tries to play a game of soccer , autonomously : artificial intelligence . 
Let 's see how it does . This was our very first trial , and ... Spectators : Goal ! 
Dennis Hong : So , there is actually a competition called RoboCup . 
I do n't know how many of you have heard about RoboCup . 
It 's an international autonomous robot soccer competition . 
And the goal of RoboCup , the actual goal is , by the year 2050 we want to have full size , autonomous humanoid robots play soccer against the human World Cup champions and win . 
It 's a true actual goal . It 's a very ambitious goal , but we truly believe that we can do it . 
So , this is last year in China . 
We were the very first team in the United States that qualified in the humanoid RoboCup competition . 
This is this year in Austria . 
You 're going to see the action , three against three , completely autonomous . 
There you go . Yes ! 
The robots track and they team play amongst themselves . 
It 's very impressive . It 's really a research event packaged in a more exciting competition event . 
What you see over here , this is the beautiful Louis Vuitton Cup trophy . 
So , this is for the best humanoid , and we would like to bring this for the very first time , to the United States next year , so wish us luck . 
Thank you . 
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents . 
Last year it actually conducted the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra for the holiday concert . 
This is the next generation robot , DARwIn IV , but smarter , faster , stronger . 
And it 's trying to show off its ability : " I 'm macho , I 'm strong . 
I can also do some Jackie Chan - motion , martial art movements . " 
And it walks away . So , this is DARwIn IV . 
And again , you 'll be able to see it in the lobby . 
We truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the United States . So , stay tuned . 
All right . So I showed you some of our exciting robots at work . 
So , what is the secret of our success ? 
Where do we come up with these ideas ? 
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ? 
We have a fully autonomous vehicle that can drive into urban environments . We won a half a million dollars in the DARPA Urban Challenge . 
We also have the world 's very first vehicle that can be driven by the blind . 
We call it the Blind Driver Challenge , very exciting . 
And many , many other robotics projects I want to talk about . 
These are just the awards that we won in 2007 fall from robotics competitions and those kinds of things . 
So , really , we have five secrets . 
First is : Where do we get inspiration ? 
Where do we get this spark of imagination ? 
This is a true story , my personal story . 
At night when I go to bed , 3 - 4 a.m. in the morning , I lie down , close my eyes , and I see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around . 
And they assemble , and they form these kinds of mechanisms . 
And then I think , " Ah this is cool . " 
So , right next to my bed I keep a notebook , a journal , with a special pen that has a light on it , LED light , because I do n't want to turn on the light and wake up my wife . 
So , I see this , scribble everything down , draw things , and I go to bed . 
Every day in the morning , the first thing I do before my first cup of coffee , before I brush my teeth , I open my notebook . 
Many times it 's empty , sometimes I have something there -- if something 's there , sometimes it 's junk -- but most of the time I ca n't even read my handwriting . 
And so , 4 am in the morning , what do you expect , right ? 
So , I need to decipher what I wrote . 
But sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there , and I have this eureka moment . 
I directly run to my home office , sit at my computer , I type in the ideas , I sketch things out and I keep a database of ideas . 
So , when we have these calls for proposals , I try to find a match between my potential ideas and the problem . If there is a match we write a research proposal , get the research funding in , and that 's how we start our research programs . 
But just a spark of imagination is not good enough . 
How do we develop these kinds of ideas ? 
At our lab RoMeLa , the Robotics and Mechanisms Laboratory , we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions . 
So , we gather around , we discuss about problems and social problems and talk about it . 
But before we start we set this golden rule . 
The rule is : Nobody criticizes anybody 's ideas . 
Nobody criticizes any opinion . 
This is important , because many times students , they fear or they feel uncomfortable how others might think about their opinions and thoughts . 
So , once you do this , it is amazing how the students open up . 
They have these wacky , cool , crazy , brilliant ideas , and the whole room is just electrified with creative energy . 
And this is how we develop our ideas . 
Well , we 're running out of time . One more thing I want to talk about is , you know , just a spark of idea and development is not good enough . 
There was a great TED moment , I think it was Sir Ken Robinson , was it ? 
He gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity . 
Well , actually , there are two sides to the story . 
So , there is only so much one can do with just ingenious ideas and creativity and good engineering intuition . 
If you want to go beyond a tinkering , if you want to go beyond a hobby of robotics and really tackle the grand challenges of robotics through rigorous research we need more than that . This is where school comes in . 
Batman , fighting against bad guys , he has his utility belt , he has his grappling hook , he has all different kinds of gadgets . 
For us roboticists , engineers and scientists , these tools , these are the courses and classes you take in class . 
Math , differential equations . 
I have linear algebra , science , physics , even nowadays , chemistry and biology , as you 've seen . 
These are all the tools that we need . 
So , the more tools you have , for Batman , more effective at fighting the bad guys , for us , more tools to attack these kinds of big problems . 
So , education is very important . 
Also , it 's not about that , only about that . You also have to work really , really hard . 
So , I always tell my students , " Work smart , then work hard . " 
This picture in the back this is 3 a.m. in the morning . 
I guarantee if you come to your lab at 3 - 4 am we have students working there , not because I tell them to , but because we are having too much fun . 
Which leads to the last topic : Do not forget to have fun . 
That 's really the secret of our success , we 're having too much fun . 
I truly believe that highest productivity comes when you 're having fun , and that 's what we 're doing . 
There you go . Thank you so much .

“ Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , ” begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk . And it 's happening to about two - thirds of the world ’s grasslands , accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos . Savory has devoted his life to stopping it . He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert .

Allan Savory : How to green the desert and reverse climate change 
The most massive tsunami perfect storm is bearing down upon us . 
This perfect storm is mounting a grim reality , increasingly grim reality , and we are facing that reality with the full belief that we can solve our problems with technology , and that 's very understandable . 
Now , this perfect storm that we are facing is the result of our rising population , rising towards 10 billion people , land that is turning to desert , and , of course , climate change . 
Now there 's no question about it at all : we will only solve the problem of replacing fossil fuels with technology . 
But fossil fuels -- carbon , coal and gas -- are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change . 
Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert , and this happens only when we create too much bare ground . 
There 's no other cause . 
And I intend to focus on most of the world 's land that is turning to desert . 
But I have for you a very simple message that offers more hope than you can imagine . 
We have environments where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year . 
On those , it is almost impossible to create vast areas of bare ground . 
No matter what you do , nature covers it up so quickly . 
And we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness , and that is where desertification is occurring . 
Fortunately , with space technology now , we can look at it from space , and when we do , you can see the proportions fairly well . 
Generally , what you see in green is not desertifying , and what you see in brown is , and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth . 
About two thirds , I would guess , of the world is desertifying . 
I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert while 25 millimeters -- that 's an inch of rain -- was falling . 
Think of it in terms of drums of water , each containing 200 liters . 
Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare of that land that day . 
The next day , the land looked like this . 
Where had that water gone ? 
Some of it ran off as flooding , but most of the water that soaked into the soil simply evaporated out again , exactly as it does in your garden if you leave the soil uncovered . 
Now , because the fate of water and carbon are tied to soil organic matter , when we damage soils , you give off carbon . 
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere . 
Now you 're told over and over , repeatedly , that desertification is only occurring in arid and semi - arid areas of the world , and that tall grasslands like this one in high rainfall are of no consequence . 
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them , you find that most of the soil in that grassland that you 've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae , leading to increased runoff and evaporation . 
That is the cancer of desertification that we do not recognize till its terminal form . 
Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock , mostly cattle , sheep and goats , overgrazing the plants , leaving the soil bare and giving off methane . 
Almost everybody knows this , from nobel laureates to golf caddies , or was taught it , as I was . 
Now , the environments like you see here , dusty environments in Africa where I grew up , and I loved wildlife , and so I grew up hating livestock because of the damage they were doing . 
And then my university education as an ecologist reinforced my beliefs . 
Well , I have news for you . 
We were once just as certain that the world was flat . 
We were wrong then , and we are wrong again . 
And I want to invite you now to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery . 
When I was a young man , a young biologist in Africa , I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks . 
Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s — and no sooner did we remove the hunting , drum - beating people to protect the animals , then the land began to deteriorate , as you see in this park that we formed . 
Now , no livestock were involved , but suspecting that we had too many elephants now , I did the research and I proved we had too many , and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain . 
Now , that was a terrible decision for me to have to make , and it was political dynamite , frankly . 
So our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research . 
They did . They agreed with me , and over the following years , we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage . 
And it got worse , not better . 
Loving elephants as I do , that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life , and I will carry that to my grave . 
One good thing did come out of it . 
It made me absolutely determined to devote my life to finding solutions . 
When I came to the United States , I got a shock , to find national parks like this one desertifying as badly as anything in Africa . 
And there 'd been no livestock on this land for over 70 years . 
And I found that American scientists had no explanation for this except that it is arid and natural . 
So I then began looking at all the research plots I could over the whole of the Western United States where cattle had been removed to prove that it would stop desertification , but I found the opposite , as we see on this research station , where this grassland that was green in 1961 , by 2002 had changed to that situation . 
And the authors of the position paper on climate change from which I obtained these pictures attribute this change to " unknown processes . " 
Clearly , we have never understood what is causing desertification , which has destroyed many civilizations and now threatens us globally . 
We have never understood it . 
Take one square meter of soil and make it bare like this is down here , and I promise you , you will find it much colder at dawn and much hotter at midday than that same piece of ground if it 's just covered with litter , plant litter . 
You have changed the microclimate . 
Now , by the time you are doing that and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground on more than half the world 's land , you are changing macroclimate . 
But we have just simply not understood why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago ? 
Why has it accelerated lately ? 
We had no understanding of that . 
What we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world , the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals , and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack - hunting predators . 
Now , the main defense against pack - hunting predators is to get into herds , and the larger the herd , the safer the individuals . 
Now , large herds dung and urinate all over their own food , and they have to keep moving , and it was that movement that prevented the overgrazing of plants , while the periodic trampling ensured good cover of the soil , as we see where a herd has passed . 
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland . 
It has just come through four months of rain , and it 's now going into eight months of dry season . 
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season . 
Now , all of that grass you see aboveground has to decay biologically before the next growing season , and if it does n't , the grassland and the soil begin to die . 
Now , if it does not decay biologically , it shifts to oxidation , which is a very slow process , and this smothers and kills grasses , leading to a shift to woody vegetation and bare soil , releasing carbon . 
To prevent that , we have traditionally used fire . 
But fire also leaves the soil bare , releasing carbon , and worse than that , burning one hectare of grassland gives off more , and more damaging , pollutants than 6,000 cars . 
And we are burning in Africa , every single year , more than one billion hectares of grasslands , and almost nobody is talking about it . 
We justify the burning , as scientists , because it does remove the dead material and it allows the plants to grow . 
Now , looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry , what could we do to keep that healthy ? 
And bear in mind , I 'm talking of most of the world 's land now . 
Okay ? We can not reduce animal numbers to rest it more without causing desertification and climate change . 
We can not burn it without causing desertification and climate change . 
What are we going to do ? 
There is only one option , I 'll repeat to you , only one option left to climatologists and scientists , and that is to do the unthinkable , and to use livestock , bunched and moving , as a proxy for former herds and predators , and mimic nature . 
There is no other alternative left to mankind . 
So let 's do that . 
So on this bit of grassland , we 'll do it , but just in the foreground . 
We 'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature , and we 've done so , and look at that . 
All of that grass is now covering the soil as dung , urine and litter or mulch , as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand , and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain , to store carbon , and to break down methane . 
And we did that , without using fire to damage the soil , and the plants are free to grow . 
When I first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much - vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification , I was faced with a real dilemma . 
How were we to do it ? 
We 'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists bunching and moving their animals , but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world . 
Then we 'd had 100 years of modern rain science , and that had accelerated desertification , as we first discovered in Africa and then confirmed in the United States , and as you see in this picture of land managed by the federal government . 
Clearly more was needed than bunching and moving the animals , and humans , over thousands of years , had never been able to deal with nature 's complexity . 
But we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this . 
So rather than reinvent the wheel , I began studying other professions to see if anybody had . 
And I found there were planning techniques that I could take and adapt to our biological need , and from those I developed what we call holistic management and planned grazing , a planning process , and that does address all of nature 's complexity and our social , environmental , economic complexity . 
Today , we have young women like this one teaching villages in Africa how to put their animals together into larger herds , plan their grazing to mimic nature , and where we have them hold their animals overnight -- we run them in a predator - friendly manner , because we have a lot of lands , and so on -- and where they do this and hold them overnight to prepare the crop fields , we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well . 
Let 's look at some results . 
This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe . 
It has just come through four months of very good rains it got that year , and it 's going into the long dry season . 
But as you can see , all of that rain , almost of all it , has evaporated from the soil surface . 
Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended , and we have 150,000 people on almost permanent food aid . 
Now let 's go to our land nearby on the same day , with the same rainfall , and look at that . 
Our river is flowing and healthy and clean . 
It 's fine . 
The production of grass , shrubs , trees , wildlife , everything is now more productive , and we have virtually no fear of dry years . 
And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats 400 percent , planning the grazing to mimic nature and integrate them with all the elephants , buffalo , giraffe and other animals that we have . 
But before we began , our land looked like that . 
This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years regardless of what rain we got . 
Okay ? Watch the marked tree and see the change as we use livestock to mimic nature . 
This was another site where it had been bare and eroding , and at the base of the marked small tree , we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil . Okay ? 
And again , watch the change just using livestock to mimic nature . 
And there are fallen trees in there now , because the better land is now attracting elephants , etc . 
This land in Mexico was in terrible condition , and I 've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound . 
I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland , and thankfully , now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future . 
And look at the amazing change in this one , where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature , and once more , we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying . 
The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here . 
The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher , and he has documented the steady decline of that land over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers . 
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock , really mimicking nature now with planned grazing , and they have documented a 50-percent increase in the production of the land in the first year . 
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture . 
Ninety - five percent of that land can only feed people from animals . 
I remind you that I am talking about most of the world 's land here that controls our fate , including the most violent region of the world , where only animals can feed people from about 95 percent of the land . 
What we are doing globally is causing climate change as much as , I believe , fossil fuels , and maybe more than fossil fuels . 
But worse than that , it is causing hunger , poverty , violence , social breakdown and war , and as I am talking to you , millions of men , women and children are suffering and dying . 
And if this continues , we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing , even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels . 
I believe I 've shown you how we can work with nature at very low cost to reverse all this . 
We are already doing so on about 15 million hectares on five continents , and people who understand far more about carbon than I do calculate that , for illustrative purposes , if we do what I am showing you here , we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere and safely store it in the grassland soils for thousands of years , and if we just do that on about half the world 's grasslands that I 've shown you , we can take us back to pre - industrial levels , while feeding people . 
I can think of almost nothing that offers more hope for our planet , for your children , and their children , and all of humanity . 
Thank you . 
Thank you . 
Thank you , Chris . 
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have , and I 'm sure everyone here has , A ) a hundred questions , B ) wants to hug you . 
I 'm just going to ask you one quick question . 
When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals , it 's desert . What do they eat ? How does that part work ? 
How do you start ? 
Allan Savory : Well , we have done this for a long time , and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed is during mine reclamation , where it 's 100 percent bare . 
But many years ago , we took the worst land in Zimbabwe , where I offered a £ 5 note in a hundred - mile drive if somebody could find one grass in a hundred - mile drive , and on that , we trebled the stocking rate , the number of animals , in the first year with no feeding , just by the movement , mimicking nature , and using a sigmoid curve , that principle . 
It 's a little bit technical to explain here , but just that . 
CA : Well , I would love to -- I mean , this such an interesting and important idea . 
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you and try and -- I want to get more on this that we could share along with the talk . AS : Wonderful . 
CA : That is an astonishing talk , truly an astonishing talk , and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way . 
Thank you so much . AS : Well , thank you . Thank you . Thank you , Chris .

Designer Emily Pilloton moved to rural Bertie County , in North Carolina , to engage in a bold experiment of design - led community transformation . She 's teaching a design - build class called Studio H that engages high schoolers ' minds and bodies while bringing smart design and new opportunities to the poorest county in the state . 
design , education , poverty 
1002 
Emily Pilloton : Teaching design for change 
So this is a story of a place that I now call home . 
It 's a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both . 
So this is Bertie County , North Carolina , USA . 
To give you an idea of the " where : " So here 's North Carolina , and if we zoom in , Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state . 
It 's about two hours east driving - time from Raleigh . 
And it 's very flat . It 's very swampy . 
It 's mostly farmland . 
The entire county is home to just 20,000 people , and they 're very sparsely distributed . 
So there 's only 27 people per square mile , which comes down to about 10 people per square kilometer . 
Bertie County is kind of a prime example in the demise of rural America . 
We 've seen this story all over the country and even in places beyond the American borders . 
We know the symptoms . 
It 's the hollowing out of small towns . 
It 's downtowns becoming ghost towns . 
The brain drain -- where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back . 
It 's the dependence on farm subsidies and under - performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban . 
And Bertie County is no exception to this . 
Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with , like many communities similar to it , is that there 's no shared , collective investment in the future of rural communities . 
Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now benefits rural communities , and yet 20 percent of our population lives there . 
So Bertie County is not only very rural ; it 's incredibly poor . 
It is the poorest county in the state . 
It has one in three of its children living in poverty , and it 's what is referred to as a " rural ghetto . " 
The economy is mostly agricultural . 
The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco , and we 're very proud of our Bertie County peanut . 
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant . 
The county seat is Windsor . 
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you 're looking at right now . 
It 's home to only 2,000 people , and like a lot of other small towns it has been hollowed out over the years . 
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair than occupied and in use . 
You can count the number of restaurants in the county on one hand -- Bunn 's Barbecue being my absolute favorite . 
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop , there 's no Internet cafe , there 's no movie theater , there 's no bookstore . 
There is n't even a Walmart . 
Racially , the county is about 60 percent African American , but what happens in the public schools is most of the privileged white kids go to the private Lawrence Academy . 
So the public school students are about 86 percent African American . 
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class , and you can see the difference is pretty stark . 
So to say that the public education system in Bertie County is struggling would be a huge understatement . 
There 's basically no pool of qualified teachers to pull from , and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor 's degree or higher . 
So there is n't a big legacy in the pride of education . 
In fact , two years ago , only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth - graders were passing the state standard in both English and math . 
So it sounds like I 'm painting a really bleak picture of this place , but I promise there is good news . 
The biggest asset , in my opinion , one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man : This is Dr. Chip Zullinger , fondly known as Dr. Z. 
He was brought in in October 2007 as the new superintendent to basically fix this broken school system . 
And he previously was a superintendent in Charleston , South Carolina and then in Denver , Colorado . 
He started some of the country 's first charter schools in the late ' 80s in the U.S. 
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary , and he is the reason that I now live and work there . 
So in February of 2009 , Dr. Zullinger invited us , Project H Design -- which is a non - profit design firm that I founded -- to come to Bertie and to partner with him on the repair of this school district and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district . 
And he invited us in particular because we have a very specific type of design process -- one that results in appropriate design solutions in places that do n't usually have access to design services or creative capital . 
Specifically , we use these six design directives , probably the most important being number two : we design with , not for -- in that , when we 're doing humanitarian - focused design , it 's not about designing for clients anymore . 
It 's about designing with people , and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within . 
So at the time of being invited down there , we were based in San Francisco , and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of 2009 , spending about half our time in Bertie County . 
And when I say we , I mean Project H , but more specifically , I mean myself and my partner , Matthew Miller , who 's an architect and a sort of MacGyver - type builder . 
So fast - forward to today , and we now live there . 
I have strategically cut Matt 's head out of this photo , because he would kill me if he knew I was using it because of the sweatsuits . 
But this is our front porch . We live there . 
We now call this place home . 
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth , we realized we had fallen in love with the place . 
We had fallen in love with the place and the people and the work that we 're able to do in a rural place like Bertie County , that , as designers and builders , you ca n't do everywhere . 
There 's space to experiment and to weld and to test things . 
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger . 
There 's a nobility of real , hands - on , dirt - under - your - fingernails work . 
But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there , there is a huge need . 
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County . 
There is n't a single licensed architect in the whole county . 
And so we saw an opportunity to bring design as this untouched tool , something that Bertie County did n't otherwise have , and to be sort of the -- to usher that in as a new type of tool in their tool kit . 
The initial goal became using design within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger -- that was why we were there . 
But beyond that , we recognized that Bertie County , as a community , was in dire need of a fresh perspective of pride and connectedness and of the creative capital that they were so much lacking . 
So the goal became , yes , to apply design within education , but then to figure out how to make education a great vehicle for community development . 
So in order to do this , we 've taken three different approaches to the intersection of design and education . 
And I should say that these are three things that we 've done in Bertie County , but I feel pretty confident that they could work in a lot of other rural communities around the U.S. and maybe even beyond . 
So the first of the three is design for education . 
This is the most kind of direct , obvious intersection of the two things . 
It 's the physical construction of improved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students . 
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we 're building schools out of these days . 
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways . 
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs . 
So traditionally , the computer labs , particularly in an under - performing school like Bertie County , where they have to benchmark test every other week , the computer lab is a kill - and - drill testing facility . 
You come in , you face the wall , you take your test and you leave . 
So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology , to create a more convivial and social space that was more engaging , more accessible , and also to increase the ability for teachers to use these spaces for technology - based instruction . 
So this is the lab at the high school , and the principal there is in love with this room . 
Every time he has visitors , it 's the first place that he takes them . 
And this also meant the co - creation with some teachers of this educational playground system called the learning landscape . 
It allows elementary - level students to learn core subjects through game play and activity and running around and screaming and being a kid . 
So this game that the kids are playing here -- in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called Match Me . 
And in Match Me , you take the class , divide it into two teams , one team on each side of the playground , and the teacher will take a piece of chalk and just write a number on each of the tires . 
And then she 'll call out a math problem -- so let 's say four times four -- and then one student from each team has to compete to figure out that four times four is 16 and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it . 
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires and then your team wins . 
And the impact of the learning landscape has been pretty surprising and amazing . 
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores , a greater comfort level with the material , especially with the boys , that in going outside and playing , they are n't afraid to take on a double - digit multiplication problem -- and also that the teachers are able to use these as assessment tools to better gauge how their students are understanding new material . 
So with design for education , I think the most important thing is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers , so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them . 
So this is Mr. Perry . He 's the assistant superintendent . 
He came out for one of our teacher - training days and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself . 
So the second approach is redesigning education itself . 
This is the most complex . 
It 's a systems - level look at how education is administered and what is being offered and to whom . 
So in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change , which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside - the - box education systems in rural communities . 
So for us , this was a graphic public campaign called Connect Bertie . 
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county . 
And this was for a fund that the school district had to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection in every home with a child in the public school system . 
Right now I should say , there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in - home Internet connection . 
And the only places to get WiFi are in the school buildings , or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint , which I find myself squatting outside of a lot . 
Aside from , you know , getting people excited and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place , it asked the school system to envision how it might become a catalyst for a more connected community . 
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls and to think about how they could play a role in the community 's development . 
So the first batch of computers are being installed later this summer , and we 're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies around how we might connect the classroom and the home to extend learning beyond the school day . 
And then the third approach , which is what I 'm most excited about , which is where we are now , is : design as education . 
So " design as education " means that we could actually teach design within public schools , and not design - based learning -- not like " let 's learn physics by building a rocket , " but actually learning design - thinking coupled with real construction and fabrication skills put towards a local community purpose . 
It also means that designers are no longer consultants , but we 're teachers , and we are charged with growing creative capital within the next generation . 
And what design offers as an educational framework is an antidote to all of the boring , rigid , verbal instruction that so many of these school districts are plagued by . 
It 's hands - on , it 's in - your - face , it requires an active engagement , and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways . 
So we started thinking about the legacy of shop class and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular -- historically , has been something intended for kids who are n't going to go to college . 
It 's a vocational training path . 
It 's working - class ; it 's blue - collar . 
The projects are things like , let 's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas . 
And in recent decades , a lot of the funding for shop class has gone away entirely . 
So we thought , what if you could bring back shop class , but this time orient the projects around things that the community needed , and to infuse shop class with a more critical and creative - design - thinking studio process . 
So we took this kind of nebulous idea and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year on writing this as a one - year curriculum offered at the high school level to the junior class . 
And so this starts in four weeks , at the end of the summer , and my partner and I , Matthew and I , just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it . 
And this is what it looks like . 
So over the course of two semesters , the Fall and the Spring , the students spend three hours a day every single day in our 4,500 square foot studio / shop space . 
And during that time , they 're doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need - finding , coming back into the studio , doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work , and then moving into the shop and actually testing them , building them , prototyping them , figuring out if they are going to work and refining that . 
And then over the summer , they 're offered a summer job . 
They 're paid as employees of Project H to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community . 
So the first project , which will be built next summer , is an open - air farmers ' market downtown , followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year . 
So these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say , " I built that , and I 'm proud of it . " 
So I want you to meet three of our students . 
This is Ryan . 
She is 15 years old . 
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher . 
She wants to go to college , but she wants to come back to Bertie County , because that 's where her family is from , where she calls home , and she feels very strongly about giving back to this place that she 's been fairly fortunate in . 
So what Studio H might offer her is a way to develop skills so that she might give back in the most meaningful way . 
This is Eric . He plays for the football team . 
He is really into dirtbike racing , and he wants to be an architect . 
So for him , Studio H offers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect , everything from drafting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a client . 
And then this is Anthony . 
He is 16 years old , loves hunting and fishing and being outside and doing anything with his hands , and so for him , Studio H means that he can stay interested in his education through that hands - on engagement . 
He 's interested in forestry , but he is n't sure , so if he ends up not going to college , he will have developed some industry - relevant skills . 
What design and building really offers to public education is a different kind of classroom . 
So this building downtown , which may very well become the site of our future farmers ' market , is now the classroom . 
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors about what kind of food they buy and from where and why -- that 's a homework assignment . 
And the ribbon - cutting ceremony at the end of the summer when they have built the farmers ' market and it 's open to the public -- that 's the final exam . 
And for the community , what design and building offers is real , visible , built progress . 
It 's one project per year , and it makes the youth the biggest asset and the biggest untapped resource in imagining a new future . 
So we recognize that Studio H , especially in its first year , is a small story -- 13 students , it 's two teachers , it 's one project in one place . 
But we feel like this could work in other places . 
And I really , strongly believe in the power of the small story , because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale . 
Because , when you zoom out that far , you lose the ability to view people as humans . 
Ultimately , design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers . 
And let 's face it , designers , we need to reinvent ourselves . 
We need to re - educate ourselves around the things that matter , we need to work outside of our comfort zones more , and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard . 
So while this is a very small story , we hope that it represents a step in the right direction for the future of rural communities and for the future of public education and hopefully also for the future of design . 
Thank you .

Pawan Sinha on how brains learn to see 
If you are a blind child in India , you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news . 
The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none , and that 's because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults , and there are very , very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children . 
In fact , if you were to be treated , you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates . 
This is a three - year - old orphan girl who had cataracts . 
So , her caretakers took her to the village medicine man , and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital , the person decided to burn her abdomen with red - hot iron bars to drive out the demons . 
The second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists , who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age , that even if you have your eye corrected , the chances of your brain learning how to see are very , very slim -- again , slim or none . 
So when I heard these two things , it troubled me deeply , both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons . 
So let me first start with the personal reason . 
It 'll sound corny , but it 's sincere . 
That 's my son , Darius . 
As a new father , I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are , what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child . 
I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius , and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment , that 's just viscerally wrong . 
So that 's the personal reason . 
Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods -- that if the brain is older than four or five years of age , it loses its ability to learn -- that does n't sit well with me , because I do n't think that idea has been tested adequately . 
The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel 's work , two researchers who were at Harvard , and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their studies of visual physiology , which are remarkably beautiful studies , but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely . 
So , they did their work with kittens , with different kinds of deprivation regiments , and those studies , which date back to the ' 60s , are now being applied to human children . 
So I felt that I needed to do two things . 
One : provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment . 
That 's the humanitarian mission . 
And the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity . 
And these two missions , as you can tell , thread together perfectly . One adds to the other ; in fact , one would be impossible without the other . 
So , to implement these twin missions , a few years ago , I launched Project Prakash . 
Prakash , as many of you know , is the Sanskrit word for light , and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children , we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience . 
And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish , it 's actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya , an earthen lamp . 
The Prakash , the overall effort has three components : outreach , to identify children in need of care ; medical treatment ; and in subsequent study . 
And I want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work . 
This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind . 
Pawan Sinha : So , because this is a school for the blind , many children have permanent conditions . 
That 's a case of microphthalmos , which is malformed eyes , and that 's a permanent condition ; it can not be treated . 
That 's an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos . 
But , every so often , we come across children who show some residual vision , and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable . 
So , after that screening , we bring the children to the hospital . 
That 's the hospital we 're working with in Delhi , the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital . 
It has a very well - equipped pediatric ophthalmic center , which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity . 
So , eating burgers actually helps . 
( Text : Such examinations allow us to improve eye - health in many children , and ... 
... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash . ) PS : So , as I zoom in to the eyes of this child , you will see the cause of his blindness . 
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts , so opacities of the lens . 
In our eyes , the lens is clear , but in this child , the lens has become opaque , and therefore he ca n't see the world . 
So , the child is given treatment . You 'll see shots of the eye . 
Here 's the eye with the opaque lens , the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted . 
And here 's the same child three weeks post - operation , with the right eye open . 
Thank you . 
So , even from that little clip , you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible , and we have now provided treatment to over 200 children , and the story repeats itself . 
After treatment , the child gains significant functionality . 
In fact , the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation . 
We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right , SRD , and she got her sight late in life , and her vision is remarkable at this age . 
I should add a tragic postscript to this -- she died two years ago in a bus accident . 
So , hers is just a truly inspiring story -- unknown , but inspiring story . 
So when we started finding these results , as you might imagine , it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press . 
Here 's an article in Nature that profiled this work , and another one in Time . 
So , we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced -- that recovery is feasible , despite extended visual deprivation . 
The next obvious question to ask : What is the process of recovery ? 
So , the way we study that is , let 's say we find a child who has light sensitivity . 
The child is provided treatment , and I want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional ; there is no quid pro quo . 
We treat many more children then we actually work with . 
Every child who needs treatment is treated . 
After treatment , about every week , we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line . 
And we try to do this for as long as possible . 
This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up . 
What might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones ? 
And we 've used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies , but I want to highlight one particular one , and that is image parsing into objects . 
So , any image of the kind that you see on the left , be it a real image or a synthetic image , it 's made up of little regions that you see in the middle column , regions of different colors , different luminances . 
The brain has this complex task of putting together , integrating , subsets of these regions into something that 's more meaningful , into what we would consider to be objects , as you see on the right . 
And nobody knows how this integration happens , and that 's the question we asked with Project Prakash . 
So , here 's what happens very soon after the onset of sight . 
Here 's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago , and you see Ethan Myers , a graduate student from MIT , running the experiment with him . 
His visual - motor coordination is quite poor , but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he 's trying to trace out . 
If you show him real world images , if you show others like him real world images , they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over - fragmented ; it 's made up of a collage , a patchwork , of regions of different colors and luminances . 
And that 's what 's indicated in the green outlines . 
When you ask them , " Even if you ca n't name the objects , just point to where the objects are , " these are the regions that they point to . 
So the world is this complex patchwork of regions . 
Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object . 
Interestingly enough , you give them a few months , and this is what happens . 
Doctor : How many are these ? 
Patient : These are two things . 
Doctor : What are their shapes ? 
Patient : Their shapes ... 
This one is a circle , and this is a square . 
PS : A very dramatic transformation has come about . 
And the question is : What underlies this transformation ? 
It 's a profound question , and what 's even more amazing is how simple the answer is . 
The answer lies in motion and that 's what I want to show you in the next clip . 
Doctor : What shape do you see here ? 
Patient : I ca n't make it out . 
Doctor : Now ? 
Patient : Triangle . 
Doctor : How many things are these ? 
Now , how many things are these ? 
Patient : Two . 
Doctor : What are these things ? 
Patient : A square and a circle . 
PS : And we see this pattern over and over again . 
The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information . 
So the inference we are deriving from this , and several such experiments , is that dynamic information processing , or motion processing , serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing ; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition . 
This simple idea has far reaching implications . 
And let me just quickly mention two , one , drawing from the domain of engineering , and one from the clinic . 
So , from the perspective of engineering , we can ask : Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system , can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine - based vision systems that can learn on their own , that do n't need to be programmed by a human programmer ? 
And that 's what we 're trying to do . 
I 'm at MIT , at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain . 
So we are creating Dylan , which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive , and autonomously discovering : What are the objects in this visual input ? 
So , do n't worry about the internals of Dylan . 
Here , I 'm just going to talk about how we test Dylan . 
The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs , as I said , of the same kind that a baby , or a child in Project Prakash would get . 
But for a long time we could n't quite figure out : Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs ? 
So , I thought , could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier , and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan ? 
So that 's what we did . 
I had to have long conversations with my wife . 
In fact , Pam , if you 're watching this , please forgive me . 
So , we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby 's visual acuity . 
As some of you might know , babyies are born pretty much legally blind . 
Their acuity -- our acuity is 20/20 ; babies ' acuity is like 20/800 , so they are looking at the world in a very , very blurry fashion . 
Here 's what a baby - cam video looks like . 
Thankfully , there is n't any audio to go with this . 
What 's amazing is that working with such highly degraded input , the baby , very quickly , is able to discover meaning in such input . 
But then two or three days afterward , babies begin to pay attention to their mother 's or their father 's face . 
How does that happen ? We want Dylan to be able to do that , and using this mantra of motion , Dylan actually can do that . 
So , given that kind of video input , with just about six or seven minutes worth of video , Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces . 
So , it 's an important demonstration of the power of motion . 
The clinical implication , it comes from the domain of autism . 
Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers . 
When we saw that , we asked : Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath , of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism ? 
Because , if that hypothesis were to be true , it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what 's causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype . 
What you 're going to see are video clips of two children -- one neurotypical , one with autism , playing Pong . 
So , while the child is playing Pong , we are tracking where they 're looking . 
In red are the eye movement traces . 
This is the neurotypical child , and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go . 
Even before the ball gets to a place , the child is already looking there . 
Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game . 
Instead of anticipating , the child always follows where the ball has been . 
The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism . 
So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we 'll have more results to report soon . 
Looking ahead , if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we 've treated so far , this is the magnitude of the problem . 
The red dots are the children we have not treated . 
So , there are many , many more children who need to be treated , and in order to expand the scope of the project , we are planning on launching The Prakash Center for Children , which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital , a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting - edge research facility . 
The Prakash Center will integrate health care , education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts . 
So , to summarize : Prakash , in its five years of existence , it 's had an impact in multiple areas , ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain , to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism , the development of autonomous machine vision systems , education of the undergraduate and graduate students , and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness . 
And for my students and I , it 's been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research , while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with . 
Thank you very much .

Aimee Mullins on running 
Sheryl Shade : Hi , Aimee . Aimee Mullins : Hi . 
SS : Aimee and I thought we 'd just talk a little bit , and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete . 
AM : Well , for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio -- it might have given it away -- I 'm a double amputee , and I was born without fibulas in both legs . 
I was amputated at age one , and I 've been running like hell ever since , all over the place . 
SS : Well , why do n't you tell them how you got to Georgetown -- why do n't we start there ? 
Why do n't we start there ? 
AM : I 'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program . 
I won a full academic scholarship out of high school . 
They pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs , and so I won a full ride to Georgetown and I 've been there for four years . Love it . 
SS : When Aimee got there , she decided that she 's , kind of , curious about track and field , so she decided to call someone and start asking about it . 
So , why do n't you tell that story ? 
AM : Yeah . Well , I guess I 've always been involved in sports . 
I played softball for five years growing up . 
I skied competitively throughout high school , and I got a little restless in college because I was n't doing anything for about a year or two sports - wise . 
And I 'd never competed on a disabled level , you know -- I 'd always competed against other able - bodied athletes . 
That 's all I 'd ever known . 
In fact , I 'd never even met another amputee until I was 17 . 
And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners , and I figured , " Oh , I do n't know about this , but before I judge it , let me go see what it 's all about . " 
So , I booked myself a flight to Boston in ' 95 , 19 years old and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race . I 'd never done it before . 
I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet to see how far I could run , and about 50 meters was enough for me , panting and heaving . 
And I had these legs that were made of a wood and plastic compound , attached with Velcro straps -- big , thick , five - ply wool socks on -- you know , not the most comfortable things , but all I 'd ever known . 
And I 'm up there in Boston against people wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite and , you know , shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things -- and they 're all looking at me like , OK , we know who 's not going to win this race . 
And , I mean , I went up there expecting -- I do n't know what I was expecting -- but , you know , when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg go up to the high jump , hop on one leg to the high jump and clear it at six feet , two inches ... 
Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11 " in ' 96 in Atlanta , I mean , if it just gives you a comparison of -- these are truly accomplished athletes , without qualifying that word " athlete . " 
And so I decided to give this a shot : heart pounding , I ran my first race and I beat the national record - holder by three hundredths of a second , and became the new national record - holder on my first try out . 
And , you know , people said , " Aimee , you know , you 've got speed -- you 've got natural speed -- but you do n't have any skill or finesse going down that track . 
You were all over the place . 
We all saw how hard you were working . " 
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown . 
And I thank god I did n't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world . 
He 's coached five Olympians , and the man 's office is lined from floor to ceiling with All America certificates of all these athletes he 's coached . 
He 's just a rather intimidating figure . 
And I called him up and said , " Listen , I ran one race and I won ... " 
" I want to see if I can , you know -- I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices , see what drills you do and whatever . " 
That 's all I wanted -- just two practices . 
" Can I just sit in and see what you do ? " 
And he said , " Well , we should meet first , before we decide anything . " 
You know , he 's thinking , " What am I getting myself into ? " 
So , I met the man , walked in his office , and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached . 
And we got to talking , and it turned out to be a great partnership because he 'd never coached a disabled athlete , so therefore he had no preconceived notions of what I was or was n't capable of , and I 'd never been coached before . 
So this was like , " Here we go -- let 's start on this trip . " 
So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break , his free time , and I would come up to the track and train with him . 
So that 's how I met Frank . 
That was fall of ' 95 . But then , by the time that winter was rolling around , he said , " You know , you 're good enough . 
You can run on our women 's track team here . " 
And I said , " No , come on . " 
And he said , " No , no , really . You can . 
You can run with our women 's track team . " 
In the spring of 1996 , with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team that May coming up full speed , I joined the women 's track team . 
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level . 
So I do n't know , it started to become an interesting mix . 
SS : Well , on your way to the Olympics , a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown . 
Why do n't you just tell them ? 
AM : Yes , well , you know , I 'd won everything as far as the disabled meets -- everything I competed in -- and , you know , training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women 's shirts -- you know , I 'm running against the next Flo - Jo -- and they 're all looking at me like , " Hmm , what 's , you know , what 's going on here ? " 
And putting on my Georgetown uniform and going out there and knowing that , you know , in order to become better -- and I 'm already the best in the country -- you know , you have to train with people who are inherently better than you . 
And I went out there and made it to the Big East , which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season . 
It was really , really hot . 
And it 's the first -- I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio , and I did n't realize at that time that the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock -- it actually acted like a lubricant and I 'd be , kind of , pistoning in the socket . 
And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint , in all my glory , I came out of my leg . 
Like , I almost came out of it , in front of , like , 5,000 people . 
And I , I mean , was just mortified -- because I was signed up for the 200 , you know , which went off in a half hour . 
I went to my coach : " Please , do n't make me do this . " 
I ca n't do this in front of all those people . My legs will come off . 
And if it came off at 85 there 's no way I 'm going 200 meters . 
And he just sat there like this . 
My pleas fell on deaf ears , thank god . 
Because you know , the man is from Brooklyn ; he 's a big man . He says , " Aimee , so what if your leg falls off ? 
You pick it up , you put the damn thing back on , and finish the goddamn race ! " 
And I did . So , he kept me in line . 
He kept me on the right track . 
SS : So , then Aimee makes it to the 1996 Paralympics , and she 's all excited . Her family 's coming down -- it 's a big deal . 
It 's now two years that you 've been running ? 
AM : No , a year . 
SS : A year . And why do n't you tell them what happened right before you go run your race ? 
AM : Okay , well , Atlanta . 
The Paralympics , just for a little bit of clarification , are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities -- amputees , persons with cerebral palsy , and wheelchair athletes -- as opposed to the Special Olympics , which deals with people with mental disabilities . 
So , here we are , a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta , and I 'm just blown away by the fact that just a year ago , I got out on a gravel track and could n't run 50 meters . 
And so , here I am -- never lost . 
I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May , and was sure that I was coming home with the gold . 
I was also the only , what they call " bilateral BK " -- below the knee . 
I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump . 
I had just done the long jump , and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says , " How do you do that ? You know , we 're supposed to have a planar foot , so we ca n't get off on the springboard . " 
I said , " Well , I just did it . No one told me that . " 
So , it 's funny -- I 'm three inches within the world record -- and kept on from that point , you know , so I 'm signed up in the long jump -- signed up ? 
No , I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter . 
And I 'm sure of it , you know ? 
I made the front page of my hometown paper that I delivered for six years , you know ? 
It was , like , this is my time for shine . 
And we 're at the trainee warm - up track , which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium . 
These legs that I was on , which I 'll take out right now -- I was the first person in the world on these legs . 
I was the guinea pig . , I 'm telling you , this was , like -- talk about a tourist attraction . 
Everyone was taking pictures -- " What is this girl running on ? " 
And I 'm always looking around , like , where is my competition ? 
It 's my first international meet . 
I tried to get it out of anybody I could , you know , " Who am I running against here ? " 
" Oh , Aimee , we 'll have to get back to you on that one . " 
I wanted to find out times . 
" Do n't worry , you 're doing great . " 
This is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium , and they post the heat sheets . And I go over and look . 
And my fastest time , which was the world record , was 15.77 . 
Then I 'm looking : the next lane , lane two , is 12.8 . 
Lane three is 12.5 . Lane four is 12.2 . I said , " What 's going on ? " 
And they shove us all into the shuttle bus , and all the women there are missing a hand . 
So , I 'm just , like -- they 're all looking at me like ' which one of these is not like the other , ' you know ? 
I 'm sitting there , like , " Oh , my god . Oh , my god . " 
You know , I 'd never lost anything , like , whether it would be the scholarship or , you know , I 'd won five golds when I skied . In everything , I came in first . 
And Georgetown -- that was great . 
I was losing , but it was the best training because this was Atlanta . 
Here we are , like , crème de la crème , and there is no doubt about it , that I 'm going to lose big . 
And , you know , I 'm just thinking , " Oh , my god , my whole family got in a van and drove down here from Pennsylvania . " 
And , you know , I was the only female U.S. sprinter . 
So they call us out and , you know -- " Ladies , you have one minute . " 
And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd , like , the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see . 
And I 'm like , " I know ! Look ! This is n't right . " 
And I 'm thinking that 's my last card to play here ; if I 'm not going to beat these girls , I 'm going to mess their heads a little , you know ? 
I mean , it was definitely the " Rocky IV " sensation of me versus Germany , and everyone else -- Estonia and Poland -- was in this heat . 
And the gun went off , and all I remember was finishing last and fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible -- this feeling of just being overwhelmed . 
And I had to think , " Why did I do this ? " 
If I had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ? 
All this training -- I had transformed my life . 
I became a collegiate athlete , you know . I became an Olympic athlete . 
And it made me really think about how the achievement was getting there . 
I mean , the fact that I set my sights , just a year and three months before , on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying , " Here 's my life going in this direction -- and I want to take it here for a while , and just seeing how far I could push it . " 
And the fact that I asked for help -- how many people jumped on board ? 
How many people gave of their time and their expertise , and their patience , to deal with me ? 
And that was this collective glory -- that there was , you know , 50 people behind me that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta . 
So , I apply this sort of philosophy now to everything I do : sitting back and realizing the progression , how far you 've come at this day to this goal , you know . 
It 's important to focus on a goal , I think , but also recognize the progression on the way there and how you 've grown as a person . 
That 's the achievement , I think . That 's the real achievement . 
SS : Why do n't you show them your legs ? 
AM : Oh , sure . 
SS : You know , show us more than one set of legs . 
AM : Well , these are my pretty legs . 
No , these are my cosmetic legs , actually , and they 're absolutely beautiful . 
You 've got to come up and see them . 
There are hair follicles on them , and I can paint my toenails . 
And , seriously , like , I can wear heels . 
Like , you guys do n't understand what that 's like to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want . 
SS : You got to pick your height ? 
AM : I got to pick my height , exactly . 
Patrick Ewing , who played for Georgetown in the ' 80s , comes back every summer . 
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room because he 'd come in with foot injuries . 
I 'm like , " Get it off ! Do n't worry about it , you know . 
You can be eight feet tall . Just take them off . " 
He did n't find it as humorous as I did , anyway . 
OK , now , these are my sprinting legs , made of carbon graphite , like I said , and I 've got to make sure I 've got the right socket . 
No , I 've got so many legs in here . 
These are -- do you want to hold that actually ? 
That 's another leg I have for , like , tennis and softball . 
It has a shock absorber in it so it , like , " Shhhh , " makes this neat sound when you jump around on it . All right . 
And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over , to keep it on . Which , when I sweat , you know , I 'm pistoning out of it . 
SS : Are you a different height ? 
AM : In these ? 
SS : In these . 
AM : I do n't know . I do n't think so . 
I may be a little taller . I actually can put both of them on . 
SS : She ca n't really stand on these legs . She has to be moving , so ... 
AM : Yeah , I definitely have to be moving , and balance is a little bit of an art in them . 
But without having the silicon sock , I 'm just going to try slip in it . 
And so , I run on these , and have shocked half the world on these . 
These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run . 
If you ever watch a sprinter , the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track . 
So when I stand in these legs , my hamstring and my glutes are contracted , as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet . 
AM : It 's a company in San Diego called Flex - Foot . 
And I was a guinea pig , as I hope to continue to be in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out . 
But actually these , like I said , are still the actual prototype . 
I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at , they were everywhere . You know , it 's like a big -- it 's come full circle . 
Moderator : Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED 2 , and we 'll talk about the design of them . 
AM : Yes , we 'll do that . 
SS : Yes , there you go . 
AM : So , these are the sprint legs , and I can put my other ... 
SS : Can you tell about who designed your other legs ? 
AM : Yes . These I got in a place called Bournemouth , England , about two hours south of London , and I 'm the only person in the United States with these , which is a crime because they are so beautiful . 
And I do n't even mean , like , because of the toes and everything . 
For me , while I 'm such a serious athlete on the track , I want to be feminine off the track , and I think it 's so important not to be limited in any capacity , whether it 's , you know , your mobility or even fashion . 
I mean , I love the fact that I can go in anywhere and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want , the skirts I want -- and I 'm hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people . 
They 're also silicon . 
This is a really basic , basic prosthetic limb under here . 
It 's like a Barbie foot under this . 
It is . It 's just stuck in this position , so I have to wear a two - inch heel . 
And , I mean , it 's really -- let me take this off so you can see it . 
I do n't know how good you can see it , but , like , it really is . 
There 're veins on the feet , and then my heel is pink , and my Achilles ' tendon -- that moves a little bit . 
And it 's really an amazing store . I got them a year and two weeks ago . 
And this is just a silicon piece of skin . 
I mean , what happened was , two years ago this man in Belgium was saying , " God , if I can go to Madame Tussauds ' wax museum and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes , looking so real as if she breathed , why ca n't they build a limb for someone that looks like a leg , or an arm , or a hand ? " 
I mean , they make ears for burn victims . 
They do amazing stuff with silicon . 
SS : Two weeks ago , Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs . 
And she came into town and she rushed around and she said , " I have to buy some new shoes ! " 
We 're an hour before the ESPYs , and she thought she 'd gotten a two - inch heel but she 'd actually bought a three - inch heel . 
AM : And this poses a problem for me , because it means I 'm walking like that all night long . 
SS : For 45 minutes . Luckily , the hotel was terrific . 
They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes . 
AM : I said to the receptionist -- I mean , I am just harried , and Sheryl 's at my side -- I said , " Look , do you have anybody here who could help me ? 
Because I have this problem ... " You know , at first they were just going to write me off , like , " If you do n't like your shoes , sorry . It 's too late . " 
" No , no , no , no . I 've got these special feet that need a two - inch heel . I have a three - inch heel . 
I need a little bit off . " 
They did n't even want to go there . 
They did n't even want to touch that one . They just did it . 
No , these legs are great . 
I 'm actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some improvements . 
I want to get legs like these made for flat feet so I can wear sneakers , because I ca n't with these ones . 
So ... Moderator : That 's it . 
SS : That 's Aimee Mullins .

Comic author Rob Reid unveils Copyright Math , a remarkable new field of study based on actual numbers from entertainment industry lawyers and lobbyists .

Rob Reid : The $ 8 billion iPod 
The recent debate over copyright laws like SOPA in the United States and the ACTA agreement in Europe has been very emotional . 
And I think some dispassionate , quantitative reasoning could really bring a great deal to the debate . 
I 'd therefore like to propose that we employ , we enlist , the cutting edge field of copyright math whenever we approach this subject . 
For instance , just recently the Motion Picture Association revealed that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year to copyright theft . 
Now rather than just argue about this number , a copyright mathematician will analyze it and he 'll soon discover that this money could stretch from this auditorium all the way across Ocean Boulevard to the Westin , and then to Mars ... 
... if we use pennies . 
Now this is obviously a powerful , some might say dangerously powerful , insight . 
But it 's also a morally important one . 
Because this is n't just the hypothetical retail value of some pirated movies that we 're talking about , but this is actual economic losses . 
This is the equivalent to the entire American corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops , as well as wheat , tobacco , rice , sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum . 
But identifying the actual losses to the economy is almost impossible to do unless we use copyright math . 
Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year since Napster first came on the scene . 
So that 's a chunk of what we 're looking for . 
But total movie revenues across theaters , home video and pay - per - view are up . 
And TV , satellite and cable revenues are way up . 
Other content markets like book publishing and radio are also up . 
So this small missing chunk here is puzzling . 
Since the big content markets have grown in line with historic norms , it 's not additional growth that piracy has prevented , but copyright math tells us it must therefore be foregone growth in a market that has no historic norms -- one that did n't exist in the 90 's . 
What we 're looking at here is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy . 
50 billion dollars of it a year , which is enough , at 30 seconds a ringtone , that could stretch from here to Neanderthal times . 
It 's true . 
I have Excel . 
The movie folks also tell us that our economy loses over 370,000 jobs to content theft , which is quite a lot when you consider that , back in ' 98 , the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that the motion picture and video industries were employing 270,000 people . 
Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people . 
And so the job losses that came with the Internet and all that content theft , have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries . 
And this is just one of the many mind - blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day . 
And some people think that string theory is tough . 
Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians ' toolkit . 
It 's the precise amount of harm that comes to media companies whenever a single copyrighted song or movie gets pirated . 
Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages and made this law . 
Some people think this number 's a little bit large , but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts are merely surprised that it does n't get compounded for inflation every year . 
Now when this law first passed , the world 's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs . 
And it was a big Christmas hit . 
Because what little hoodlum would n't want a million and a half bucks - worth of stolen goods in his pocket . 
These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs , which is to say eight billion dollars - worth of stolen media . 
Or about 75,000 jobs . 
Now you might find copyright math strange , but that 's because it 's a field that 's best left to experts . 
So that 's it for now . 
I hope you 'll join me next time when I will be making an equally scientific and fact - based inquiry into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy . 
Thank you very much . 
Thank you .

From rockets to stock markets , many of humanity 's most thrilling creations are powered by math . So why do kids lose interest in it ? Conrad Wolfram says the part of math we teach -- calculation by hand -- is n't just tedious , it 's mostly irrelevant to real mathematics and the real world . He presents his radical idea : teaching kids math through computer programming .

Conrad Wolfram : Teaching kids real math with computers 
We 've got a real problem with math education right now . 
Basically , no one 's very happy . 
Those learning it think it 's disconnected , uninteresting and hard . 
Those trying to employ them think they do n't know enough . 
Governments realize that it 's a big deal for our economies , but do n't know how to fix it . 
And teachers are also frustrated . 
Yet math is more important to the world than at any point in human history . 
So at one end we 've got falling interest in education in math , and at the other end we 've got a more mathematical world , a more quantitative world than we ever have had . 
So what 's the problem , why has this chasm opened up , and what can we do to fix it ? 
Well actually , I think the answer is staring us right in the face : Use computers . 
I believe that correctly using computers is the silver bullet for making math education work . 
So to explain that , let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world and what it looks like in education . 
See , in the real world math is n't necessarily done by mathematicians . 
It 's done by geologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people -- modeling and simulation . 
It 's actually very popular . 
But in education it looks very different -- dumbed - down problems , lots of calculating , mostly by hand . 
Lots of things that seem simple and not difficult like in the real world , except if you 're learning it . 
And another thing about math : math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes it does n't -- like " Am I drunk ? " 
And then you get an answer that 's quantitative in the modern world . 
You would n't have expected that a few years back . 
But now you can find out all about -- unfortunately , my weight is a little higher than that , but -- all about what happens . 
So let 's zoom out a bit and ask , why are we teaching people math ? 
What 's the point of teaching people math ? 
And in particular , why are we teaching them math in general ? 
Why is it such an important part of education as a sort of compulsory subject ? 
Well , I think there are about three reasons : technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies , what I call " everyday living " -- to function in the world today , you 've got to be pretty quantitative , much more so than a few years ago : figure out your mortgages , being skeptical of government statistics , those kinds of things -- and thirdly , what I would call something like logical mind training , logical thinking . 
Over the years we 've put so much in society into being able to process and think logically . It 's part of human society . 
It 's very important to learn that math is a great way to do that . 
So let 's ask another question . 
What is math ? 
What do we mean when we say we 're doing math , or educating people to do math ? 
Well , I think it 's about four steps , roughly speaking , starting with posing the right question . 
What is it that we want to ask ? What is it we 're trying to find out here ? 
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world , beyond virtually any other part of doing math . 
People ask the wrong question , and surprisingly enough , they get the wrong answer , for that reason , if not for others . 
So the next thing is take that problem and turn it from a real world problem into a math problem . 
That 's stage two . 
Once you 've done that , then there 's the computation step . 
Turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form . 
And of course , math is very powerful at doing that . 
And then finally , turn it back to the real world . 
Did it answer the question ? 
And also verify it -- crucial step . 
Now here 's the crazy thing right now . 
In math education , we 're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time teaching people to do step three by hand . 
Yet , that 's the one step computers can do better than any human after years of practice . 
Instead , we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one , two and four -- conceptualizing problems , applying them , getting the teacher to run them through how to do that . 
See , crucial point here : math is not equal to calculating . 
Math is a much broader subject than calculating . 
Now it 's understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years . 
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand . 
But in the last few decades that has totally changed . 
We 've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject that I could ever imagine with computers . 
Calculating was typically the limiting step , and now often it is n't . 
So I think in terms of the fact that math has been liberated from calculating . 
But that math liberation did n't get into education yet . 
See , I think of calculating , in a sense , as the machinery of math . 
It 's the chore . 
It 's the thing you 'd like to avoid if you can , like to get a machine to do . 
It 's a means to an end , not an end in itself , and automation allows us to have that machinery . 
Computers allow us to do that -- and this is not a small problem by any means . 
I estimated that , just today , across the world , we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand . 
That 's an amazing amount of human endeavor . 
So we better be damn sure -- and by the way , they did n't even have fun doing it , most of them -- so we better be damn sure that we know why we 're doing that and it has a real purpose . 
I think we should be assuming computers for doing the calculating and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that . 
And I think there are some cases . 
For example : mental arithmetic . 
I still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating . 
People say , " Is such and such true ? " 
And I 'll say , " Hmm , not sure . " I 'll think about it roughly . 
It 's still quicker to do that and more practical . 
So I think practicality is one case where it 's worth teaching people by hand . 
And then there are certain conceptual things that can also benefit from hand calculating , but I think they 're relatively small in number . 
One thing I often ask about is ancient Greek and how this relates . 
See , the thing we 're doing right now is we 're forcing people to learn mathematics . 
It 's a major subject . 
I 'm not for one minute suggesting that , if people are interested in hand calculating or in following their own interests in any subject however bizarre -- they should do that . 
That 's absolutely the right thing , for people to follow their self - interest . 
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek , but I do n't think that we should force the entire population to learn a subject like ancient Greek . 
I do n't think it 's warranted . 
So I have this distinction between what we 're making people do and the subject that 's sort of mainstream and the subject that , in a sense , people might follow with their own interest and perhaps even be spiked into doing that . 
So what are the issues people bring up with this ? 
Well one of them is , they say , you need to get the basics first . 
You should n't use the machine until you get the basics of the subject . 
So my usual question is , what do you mean by " basics ? " 
Basics of what ? 
Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it , or design it for that matter ? 
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill ? 
I do n't think so . 
I think you need to separate the basics of what you 're trying to do from how it gets done and the machinery of how it gets done and automation allows you to make that separation . 
A hundred years ago , it 's certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things . 
But automation in cars allowed that to separate , so driving is now a quite separate subject , so to speak , from engineering of the car or learning how to service it . 
So automation allows this separation and also allows -- in the case of driving , and I believe also in the future case of maths -- a democratized way of doing that . 
It can be spread across a much larger number of people who can really work with that . 
So there 's another thing that comes up with basics . 
People confuse , in my view , the order of the invention of the tools with the order in which they should use them for teaching . 
So just because paper was invented before computers , it does n't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics . 
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this . 
She enjoys making what she calls " paper laptops . " 
So I asked her one day , " You know , when I was your age , I did n't make these . 
Why do you think that was ? " 
And after a second or two , carefully reflecting , she said , " No paper ? " 
If you were born after computers and paper , it does n't really matter which order you 're taught with them in , you just want to have the best tool . 
So another one that comes up is " Computers dumb math down . " 
That somehow , if you use a computer , it 's all mindless button - pushing , but if you do it by hand , it 's all intellectual . 
This one kind of annoys me , I must say . 
Do we really believe that the math that most people are doing in school practically today is more than applying procedures to problems they do n't really understand , for reasons they do n't get ? 
I do n't think so . 
And what 's worse , what they 're learning there is n't even practically useful anymore . 
Might have been 50 years ago , but it is n't anymore . 
When they 're out of education , they do it on a computer . 
Just to be clear , I think computers can really help with this problem , actually make it more conceptual . 
Now , of course , like any great tool , they can be used completely mindlessly , like turning everything into a multimedia show , like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand , where the computer was the teacher -- show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand . 
This is just nuts . 
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand that the computer should be doing anyway ? 
All backwards . 
Let me show you that you can also make problems harder to calculate . 
See , normally in school , you do things like solve quadratic equations . 
But you see , when you 're using a computer , you can just substitute . 
You can make it a quartic equation . Make it kind of harder , calculating - wise . 
Same principles applied -- calculations , harder . 
And problems in the real world look nutty and horrible like this . 
They 've got hair all over them . 
They 're not just simple , dumbed - down things that we see in school math . 
And think of the outside world . 
Do we really believe that engineering and biology and all of these other things that have so benefited from computers and maths have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers ? 
I do n't think so -- quite the opposite . 
So the problem we 've really got in math education is not that computers might dumb it down , but that we have dumbed - down problems right now . 
Well , another issue people bring up is somehow that hand calculating procedures teach understanding . 
So if you go through lots of examples , you can get the answer , you can understand how the basics of the system work better . 
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here , which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important . 
But there 's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world . 
It 's called programming . 
Programming is how most procedures and processes get written down these days , and it 's also a great way to engage students much more and to check they really understand . 
If you really want to check you understand math then write a program to do it . 
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that . 
So to be clear , what I really am suggesting here is we have a unique opportunity to make maths both more practical and more conceptual , simultaneously . 
I ca n't think of any other subject where that 's recently been possible . 
It 's usually some kind of choice between the vocational and the intellectual . 
But I think we can do both at the same time here . 
And we open up so many more possibilities . 
You can do so many more problems . 
What I really think we gain from this is students getting intuition and experience in far greater quantities than they 've ever got before . 
And experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math , interact with it , feel it . 
We want people who can feel the math instinctively . 
That 's what computers allow us to do . 
Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum . 
Traditionally it 's been by how difficult it is to calculate , but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts , however hard the calculating . 
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late . 
Why is this ? 
Well , it 's damn hard doing the calculations , that 's the problem . 
But actually many of the concepts are amenable to a much younger age group . 
This was an example I built for my daughter . 
And very , very simple . 
We were talking about what happens when you increase the number of sides of a polygon to a very large number . 
And of course , it turns into a circle . 
And by the way , she was also very insistent on being able to change the color , an important feature for this demonstration . 
You can see that this is a very early step into limits and differential calculus and what happens when you take things to an extreme -- and very small sides and a very large number of sides . 
Very simple example . 
That 's a view of the world that we do n't usually give people for many , many years after this . 
And yet , that 's a really important practical view of the world . 
So one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams . 
In the end , if we test everyone by hand in exams , it 's kind of hard to get the curricula changed to a point where they can use computers during the semesters . 
And one of the reasons it 's so important -- so it 's very important to get computers in exams . 
And then we can ask questions , real questions , questions like , what 's the best life insurance policy to get ? -- real questions that people have in their everyday lives . 
And you see , this is n't some dumbed - down model here . 
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens . 
How many years of protection do I need ? 
What does that do to the payments and to the interest rates and so forth ? 
Now I 'm not for one minute suggesting it 's the only kind of question that should be asked in exams , but I think it 's a very important type that right now just gets completely ignored and is critical for people 's real understanding . 
So I believe [ there is ] critical reform we have to do in computer - based math . 
We have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward , and also our societies , based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics . 
This is n't some optional extra . 
And the country that does this first will , in my view , leapfrog others in achieving a new economy even , an improved economy , an improved outlook . 
In fact , I even talk about us moving from what we often call now the " knowledge economy " to what we might call a " computational knowledge economy , " where high - level math is integral to what everyone does in the way that knowledge currently is . 
We can engage so many more students with this , and they can have a better time doing it . 
And let 's understand : this is not an incremental sort of change . 
We 're trying to cross the chasm here between school math and the real - world math . 
And you know if you walk across a chasm , you end up making it worse than if you did n't start at all -- bigger disaster . 
No , what I 'm suggesting is that we should leap off , we should increase our velocity so it 's high , and we should leap off one side and go the other -- of course , having calculated our differential equation very carefully . 
So I want to see a completely renewed , changed math curriculum built from the ground up , based on computers being there , computers that are now ubiquitous almost . 
Calculating machines are everywhere and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years . 
Now I 'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math , but what I am sure is it 's the mainstream subject of the future . 
Let 's go for it , and while we 're about it , let 's have a bit of fun , for us , for the students and for TED here . 
Thanks .

< em > Minority Report</em > science adviser and inventor John Underkoffler demos g - speak -- the real - life version of the film 's eye - popping , tai chi - meets - cyberspace computer interface . Is this how tomorrow 's computers will be controlled ?

John Underkoffler points to the future of UI 
We 're 25 , 26 years after the advent of the Macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human - machine interface and in computation in general . 
It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation , thought about computers , how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them . 
It was such a radical change , in fact , that the early Macintosh development team in ' 82 , ' 83 , ' 84 had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up . 
Now , this is an interesting little message , and it 's a lesson that has since , I think , been forgotten or lost or something , and that is , namely , that the OS is the interface . 
The interface is the OS . 
It 's like the land and the king they 're inseparable , they are one . 
And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter . 
It was n't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines . 
There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers . 
So it was a necessity . 
But in the quarter - century since then , we 've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk . 
So memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million . 
Same thing for processor speeds . 
Networks , we did n't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh 's introduction , and that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers . 
And , of course , graphics : Today 84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago . 
So we 've got that incredible ramp - up . 
Then , on the side , we 've got the Web and , increasingly , the cloud , which is fantastic , but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental -- kind of a distraction . 
So we 've forgotten to invent new interfaces . 
Certainly we 've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard , and people are starting to wake up about that . 
So what happens next ? Where do we go from there ? 
The problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word : " space , " or a single , simple phrase : " real world geometry . " 
Computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hideously insensate when it comes to space . 
They do n't understand real world space . 
It 's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well . 
They also do n't understand time , but that 's a matter for a separate talk . 
So what happens if you start to explain space to them ? 
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room . 
The Luminous Room is a system in which it 's considered that input and output spaces are co - located . 
That 's a strangely simple , and yet unexplored idea , right ? 
When you use a mouse , your hand is down here on the mouse pad . 
It 's not even on the same plane as what you 're talking about : The pixels are up on the display . 
So here was a room in which all the walls , floors , ceilings , pets , potted plants , whatever was in there , were capable , not only of display but of sensing as well . 
And that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this . 
That 's a digital storage in a physical container . 
The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers . 
Has to come back out , whatever you put in . 
This little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well . 
If you presented it with a chess board , it tried to figure out what you might mean by that . 
And if there was nothing for them to do , the chess pieces eventually got bored and hopped away . 
The academics who were overseeing this work thought that that was too frivolous , so we built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser . 
The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects , and the system projects down the laser beam path . 
So you 've got an interface that has no interface . 
You operate the world as you operate the real world , which is to say , with your hands . 
Similarly , a digital wind tunnel with digital wind flowing from right to left -- not that remarkable in a sense ; we did n't invent the mathematics . 
But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display , it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object , a real world object in that . 
Here , the real world merges with the simulation . 
And finally , to pull out all the stops , this is a system called Urp , for urban planners , in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use CAD systems . 
And we make the machine meet them half way . 
It projects down digital shadows , as you see here . 
And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock , then you can control the sun 's position in the sky . 
That 's 8 a.m. shadows . 
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m. 
There you are , swinging the sun around . 
Short shadows at noon and so forth . 
And we built up a series of tools like this . 
There are inter - shadowing studies that children can operate , even though they do n't know anything about urban planning : To move a building , you simply reach out your hand and you move the building . 
A material wand makes the building into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions . 
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways ? 
A zoning tool connects distant structures , a building and a roadway . 
Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission ? And so forth . 
Now , if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated , that 's great ; they should seem familiar . 
This work is 15 years old . 
This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii , director of the Tangible Media Group . 
But it was that work that was seen by Alex McDowell , one of the world 's legendary production designers . 
But Alex was preparing a little , sort of obscure , indie , arthouse film called " Minority Report " for Steven Spielberg , and invited us to come out from MIT and design the interfaces that would appear in that film . 
And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude , the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable , that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R&D effort . 
And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual . 
People still reference those sequences in " Minority Report " when they talk about new UI design . 
So this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the Spatial Operating Environment , we call it . 
So here we have a bunch of stuff , some images . 
And , using a hand , we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom , six degrees of navigational control . 
And it 's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett 's eye . 
And you can come back out through the scary orangutan . 
And that 's all well and good . 
Let 's do something a little more difficult . 
Here , we have a whole bunch of disparate images . 
We can fly around them . 
So navigation is a fundamental issue . 
You have to be able to navigate in 3D. 
Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial . 
And the part that is n't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it . 
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways . 
So we can throw it out like that . Let 's reset it . 
We can organize it this way . 
And , of course , it 's not just about navigation , but about manipulation as well . 
So if we do n't like stuff , or we 're intensely curious about Ernst Haeckel 's scientific falsifications , we can pull them out like that . 
And then if it 's time for analysis , we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution . 
Let 's just come down a bit and fly around . 
So that 's a different way to look at stuff . 
If you 're of a more analytical nature then you might want , actually , to look at this as a color histogram . 
So now we 've got the stuff color - sorted , angle maps onto color . 
And now , if we want to select stuff , 3D , space , the idea that we 're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in , not in 2D , not in fake 2D , but in actual 3D. 
Here are some selection planes . 
And we 'll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass . 
So , from there to the world of real work . 
Here 's a logistics system , a small piece of one that we 're currently building . 
There 're a lot of elements . 
And one thing that 's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three - dimensional and geospatial information . 
So here 's a familiar place . 
And we 'll bring this back here for a second . 
Maybe select a little bit of that . 
And bring out this graph . 
And we should , now , be able to fly in here and have a closer look . 
These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States . 
One thing that three - dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one - to - one pairing between human beings and computers . 
That 's the old way , that 's the old mantra : one machine , one human , one mouse , one screen . 
Well , that does n't really cut it anymore . 
In the real world , we have people who collaborate ; we have people who have to work together , and we have many different displays . 
And we might want to look at these various images . 
We might want to ask for some help . 
The author of this new pointing device is sitting over there , so I can pull this from there to there . 
These are unrelated machines , right ? 
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble . 
So I 'm going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul . 
Paul is the designer of this wand , and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what 's going on . 
So let me get some of these out of the way . 
Let 's pull this apart : I 'll go ahead and explode it . 
Kevin , can you help ? 
Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board . 
Mind you , it 's a sort of gratuitous field - stripping exercise , but we do it in the lab all the time . 
All right . 
So collaborative work , whether it 's immediately co - located or distant and distinct , is always important . 
And again , that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space . 
And finally , I 'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery . 
This is a system called TAMPER , which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be . 
We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine - grained form . 
So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here . 
And let 's just pick out a few elements . 
We can zip through them as a possibility . 
We can grab elements off the front , where upon they reanimate , come to life , and drag them down onto the table here . 
We 'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well . 
We may need more than one . 
And we probably need , well , we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest . 
Yeah , let 's take that one . 
You see , cowboys and French farce people do n't go well together , and the system knows that . 
Let me leave with one final thought , and that is that one of the greatest English language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift . 
And he was n't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [ dollars ] , or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks to buy the stolen Vermeer ; he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence . 
And I think that it 's time that we asked for the same from technology . 
Technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity , and we need to demand that , in fact . 
For some of this kind of technology , ground center is a combination of design , which is crucially important . 
We ca n't have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start . 
And , as well , as of efficacy , agency . 
We 're , as human beings , the creatures that create , and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image . 
So I will leave you with that . Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : So to ask the obvious question -- actually this is from Bill Gates -- when ? 
CA : When real ? When for us , not just in a lab and on a stage ? 
Can it be for every man , or is this just for corporations and movie producers ? 
JU : No , it has to be for every human being . 
That 's our goal entirely . 
We wo n't have succeeded unless we take that next big step . 
I mean it 's been 25 years . 
Can there really be only one interface ? There ca n't . 
CA : But does that mean that , at your desk or in your home , you need projectors , cameras ? 
You know , how can it work ? 
JU : No , this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display . 
It 'll be built into architecture . 
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years . 
So this is the inevitability about it . 
CA : So , in your mind , five years time , someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface ? 
JU : I think in five years time when you buy a computer , you 'll get this . 
CA : Well that 's cool . 
The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used . 
What do you think , what in your mind is the first killer app for this ? 
JU : That 's a good question , and we ask ourselves that every day . 
At the moment , our early - adopter customers -- and these systems are deployed out in the real world -- do all the big data intensive , data heavy problems with it . 
So , whether it 's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction , financial services , pharmaceuticals , bioinformatics , those are the topics right now , but that 's not a killer app . 
And I understand what you 're asking . 
CA : C'mon , c'mon . Martial arts , games . C'mon . 
John , thank you for making science - fiction real . 
JU : It 's been a great pleasure . 
Thank you to you all .

A.J. Jacobs ' year of living biblically 
I thought I 'd tell you a little about what I like to write . 
And I like to immerse myself in my topics . 
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig . 
And I see my life as a series of experiments . 
So , I work for Esquire magazine , and a couple of years ago , I wrote an article called " My Outsourced Life , " where I hired a team of people in Bangalore , India , to live my life for me . 
So , they answered my emails . 
They answered my phone . 
They argued with my wife for me , and they read my son bedtime stories . 
It was the best month of my life , because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies . 
It was a wonderful experience . 
More recently , I wrote an article for Esquire called -- about radical honesty . 
And this is a movement where -- this is started by a psychologist in Virginia , who says that you should never , ever lie , except maybe during poker and golf , his only exceptions . 
And , more than that , whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth . 
So , I decided I would try this for a month . 
This was the worst month of my life . 
I do not recommend this at all . 
To give you a sense of the experience , the article was called , " I Think You 're Fat . " 
So , that was hard . 
My most recent book -- my previous book was called " The Know - It - All , " and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world , or more precisely from Aak , which is a type of East Asian music , all the way to Zwyiec , which is -- well , I do n't want to ruin the ending . 
It 's a very exciting twist ending , like an O. Henry novel , so I wo n't ruin it . 
But I love that one , because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb . 
Although , listening to Kevin Kelly , you do n't have to remember anything . 
You can just Google it . 
So , I wasted some time there . 
I love those experiments , but I think that the most profound and life - changing experiment that I 've done is my most recent experiment , where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible , " The Year of Living Biblically . " 
And I undertook this for two reasons . 
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all . 
As I say in my book , I 'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian . 
So , not very . 
But I 've become increasingly interested in religion . 
I do think it 's the defining issue of our time , or one of the main ones . 
And I have a son . I want to know what to teach him . 
So , I decided to dive in head first , and try to live the Bible . 
The second reason I undertook this is because I 'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism , religious fundamentalism , and people who say they take the Bible literally , which is , according to some polls , as high as 45 or 50 percent of America . 
So I decided , what if you really did take the Bible literally ? 
I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally , without picking and choosing . 
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles . 
I had Christian bibles . 
I had Jewish bibles . 
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip - hop bible , where the twenty - third Psalm is rendered as , " The Lord is all that , " as opposed to what I knew it as , " The Lord is my shepherd . " 
Then I went down and I read several versions , and I wrote down every single law that I could find . 
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules . 
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- So I wanted to follow those . 
And actually , I take my projects very seriously , because I had twins during my year , so I definitely take my projects seriously . 
But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible . 
There is the law in Leviticus , " You can not shave the corners of your beard . " 
I did n't know where my corners were , so I decided to let the whole thing grow , and this is what I looked like by the end . 
As you can imagine , I spent a lot of time at airport security . 
My wife would n't kiss me for the last two months . 
So , certainly the challenge was there . 
The Bible says you can not wear clothes made of mixed fibers , so I thought , " Sounds strange , but I 'll try it . " 
You only know if you try it . 
I got rid of all my poly - cotton T - shirts . 
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight , and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man , then her hand shall be cut off . 
So , I wanted to follow that rule . 
That one I followed by default , by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby , looking like she had a strong grip . 
So -- oh , there 's another shot of my beard . 
I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing , and incredibly challenging . 
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging . 
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day . 
You know , I could spend a year not killing , but spending a year not gossiping , not coveting , not lying -- you know , I live in New York , and I work as a journalist , so this was 75 , 80 percent of my day I had to do it . 
But it was really interesting , because I was able to make some progress , because I could n't believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts . 
This was one of the huge lessons of the year , is that I almost pretended to be a better person , and I became a little bit of a better person . 
So I had always thought , you know , " You change your mind , and you change your behavior , " but it 's often the other way around . 
You change your behavior , and you change your mind . 
So , you know , if you want to become more compassionate , you visit sick people in the hospital , and you will become more compassionate . 
You donate money to a cause , and you become emotionally involved in that cause . 
So , it really was cognitive psychology -- you know , cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing . 
The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology , very primitive cognitive psychology . 
In the Proverbs , it says that if you smile , you will become happier , which , as we know , is actually true . 
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty - first - century America . 
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers . 
But it 's a big part of the Bible , so I figured I had to address it . 
So , I was able to stone one adulterer . 
It happened -- I was in the park , and I was dressed in my biblical clothing , so sandals and sort of a white robe , you know , because again , the outer affects the inner . 
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind . 
And this man came up to me and he said , " Why are you dressed like that ? " 
And I explained my project , and he said , " Well , I am an adulterer , are you going to stone me ? " 
And I said , " Well , that would be great ! " 
And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks , hoping for just this interaction -- and , you know , they were pebbles -- but he grabbed them out of my hand . 
He was actually an elderly man , mid-70s , just so you know . 
But he 's still an adulterer , and still quite angry . 
He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face , and I felt that I could -- eye for an eye -- I could retaliate , and throw one back at him . 
So that was my experience stoning , and it did allow me to talk about , in a more serious way , these big issues . 
How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places , and yet so incredibly wise in others ? 
How should we view the Bible ? 
Should we view it , you know , as original intent , like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible ? 
How was the Bible written ? 
And actually , since this is a tech crowd , I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia , because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years . 
And it 's sort of evolved . 
It 's not a book that was written and came down from on high . 
So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take - aways , the bigger lessons that I learned from my year . 
The first is , thou shalt not take the Bible literally . 
This became very , very clear , early on . 
Because if you do , then you end up acting like a crazy person , and stoning adulterers , or -- here 's another example . 
Well , that 's another . I did spend some time shepherding . 
It 's a very relaxing vocation . I recommend it . 
But this one is -- the Bible says that you can not touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you can not sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat . 
And my wife thought this was very offensive , so she sat in every seat in our apartment , and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around . 
So , you know , I met with creationists . 
I went to the creationists ' museum . 
And these are the ultimate literalists . 
And it was fascinating , because they were not stupid people at all . 
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist . 
It 's just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model . 
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this . 
And I will say , though , the museum is gorgeous . 
They really did a fantastic job . 
If you 're ever in Kentucky , there 's , you can see a movie of the flood , and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes . 
So , whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it 's crazy -- they did a great job . 
Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks . 
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying , giving these prayers of thanksgiving , which was odd for an agnostic . 
But I was saying thanks all the time , every day , and I started to change my perspective . 
And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day , that I did n't even notice , that I took for granted , as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong . 
So , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when I came over here , the car did n't flip over , and I did n't trip coming up the stairs . 
It 's a remarkable thing . 
Third , that thou shall have reverence . 
This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic , and by the end of the year , I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic , which I love . 
And I 'm trying to start it as a movement . 
So , if anyone wants to join , the basic idea is , whether or not there is a God , there 's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness , and that our rituals can be sacred . 
The Sabbath can be sacred . 
This was one of the great things about my year , doing the Sabbath , because I am a workaholic , so having this one day where you can not work , it really , that changed my life . 
So , this idea of sacredness , whether or not there is a God . 
Thou shall not stereotype . 
This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey . 
I wanted it to be about religion in America . 
So , I spent time with evangelical Christians , and Hasidic Jews , and the Amish . 
I 'm very proud because I think I 'm the only person in America to out Bible - talk a Jehovah 's Witness . 
After three and a half hours , he looked at his watch , he 's like , " I got ta go . " 
Oh , thank you very much . 
Thank you . Bless you , bless you . 
But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical Christianity , and I found that it 's such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it . 
There 's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians , and they focus on the red words in the Bible , which are the ones that Jesus spoke . 
That 's how they printed them in the old Bibles . 
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality . 
They have a pamphlet that says , " Here 's what Jesus said about homosexuality , " and you open it up , and there 's nothing in it . 
So , they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts , helping poor people . 
So , this was very inspiring to me . 
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo . 
They 're very inspiring leaders , even though I disagree with much of what they say . 
Also , thou shalt not disregard the irrational . 
This one was very unexpected because , you know , I grew up with the scientific worldview , and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces . 
And the thing is , if they 're not harmful , they 're not to be completely dismissed . 
Because I learned that -- I was thinking , I was doing all these rituals , these biblical rituals , separating my wool and linen , and I would ask these religious people " Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this ? Why would God care ? " 
And they said , " We do n't know , but it 's just rituals that give us meaning . " 
And I would say , " But that 's crazy . " 
And they would say , " Well , what about you ? 
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake . 
If a guy from Mars came down and saw , here 's one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics , would the Martians say , ' Well , that guy , he makes sense , but that guy 's crazy ? ' " So no , I think that rituals are , by nature , irrational . 
So the key is to choose the right rituals , the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed . 
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose . 
And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible . 
And I failed miserably . 
Because you ca n't . 
You have to pick and choose . And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing . 
The key is to pick and choose the right parts . 
There 's the phrase called cafeteria religion , and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way , and they 'll say , " Oh , it 's just cafeteria religion . 
You 're just picking and choosing . " 
But my argument is , " What 's wrong with cafeterias ? " 
I 've had some great meals at cafeterias . 
I 've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave . 
So , it 's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion , about tolerance , about loving your neighbor , as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin , or intolerance , or violence , which are very much in the Bible as well . 
So if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it . 
And I thought I 'd end with just a couple more . 
There 's me reading the Bible . 
That 's how I hailed taxicabs . 
Seriously , and it worked . And yes , that was actually a rented sheep , so I had to return that in the morning , but it served well for a day . 
So , anyway , thank you so much for letting me speak .

Clay Shirky looks at " cognitive surplus " -- the shared , online work we do with our spare brain cycles . While we 're busy editing Wikipedia , posting to Ushahidi , we 're building a better , more cooperative world .

Clay Shirky : How cognitive surplus will change the world 
The story starts in Kenya in December of 2007 , when there was a disputed presidential election , and in the immediate aftermath of that election , there was an outbreak of ethnic violence . 
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi , Ory Okolloh -- who some of you may know from her TEDTalk -- who began blogging about it on her site , Kenyan Pundit . 
And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence , the government suddenly imposed a significant media blackout . 
And so weblogs went from being commentary as part of the media landscape to being a critical part of the media landscape in trying to understand where the violence was . 
And Okolloh solicited from her commenters more information about what was going on . 
The comments began pouring in , and Okolloh would collate them . She would post them . 
And she quickly said , " It 's too much . 
I could do this all day every day and I ca n't keep up . 
There is more information about what 's going on in Kenya right now than any one person can manage . 
If only there was a way to automate this . " 
And two programmers who read her blog held their hands up and said , " We could do that , " and in 72 hours , they launched Ushahidi . 
Ushahidi -- the name means " witness " or " testimony " in Swahili -- is a very simple way of taking reports from the field , whether it 's from the web or , critically , via mobile phones and SMS , aggregating it and putting it on a map . 
That 's all it is , but that 's all that 's needed because what it does is it takes the tacit information available to the whole population -- everybody knows where the violence is , but no one person knows what everyone knows -- and it takes that tacit information and it aggregates it , and it maps it and it makes it public . 
And that , that maneuver called " crisis mapping , " was kicked off in Kenya in January of 2008 . 
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough that the programmers who created Ushahidi decided they were going to make it open source and turn it into a platform . 
It 's since been deployed in Mexico to track electoral fraud . 
It 's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup . 
And it 's been used most famously in Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake . 
And when you look at the map now posted on the Ushahidi front page , you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi has gone worldwide , all right ? 
This went from a single idea and a single implementation in East Africa in the beginning of 2008 to a global deployment in less than three years . 
Now what Okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology . 
What Okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity . 
And the interesting moment now , the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true . 
That is the resource that I 'm talking about . 
I call it cognitive surplus . 
And it represents the ability of the world 's population to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate on large , sometimes global , projects . 
Cognitive surplus is made up of two things . 
The first , obviously , is the world 's free time and talents . 
The world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects . 
Now , that free time existed in the 20th century , but we did n't get Ushahidi in the 20th century . 
That 's the second half of cognitive surplus . 
The media landscape in the 20th century was very good at helping people consume , and we got , as a result , very good at consuming . 
But now that we 've been given media tools -- the Internet , mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume , what we 're seeing is that people were n't couch potatoes because we liked to be . 
We were couch potatoes because that was the only opportunity given to us . 
We still like to consume , of course . 
But it turns out we also like to create , and we like to share . 
And it 's those two things together -- ancient human motivation and the modern tools to allow that motivation to be joined up in large - scale efforts -- that are the new design resource . 
And using cognitive surplus , we 're starting to see truly incredible experiments in scientific , literary , artistic , political efforts . 
Designing . 
We 're also getting , of course , a lot of LOLcats . 
LOLcats are cute pictures of cats made cuter with the addition of cute captions . 
And they are also part of the abundant media landscape we 're getting now . 
This is one of the participatory -- one of the participatory models we see coming out of that , along with Ushahidi . 
Now I want to stipulate , as the lawyers say , that LOLcats are the stupidest possible creative act . 
There are other candidates of course , but LOLcats will do as a general case . 
But here 's the thing : The stupidest possible creative act is still a creative act . 
Someone who has done something like this , however mediocre and throwaway , has tried something , has put something forward in public . 
And once they 've done it , they can do it again , and they could work on getting it better . 
There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work , and as anybody who 's worked as an artist or a creator knows , it 's a spectrum you 're constantly struggling to get on top of . 
The gap is between doing anything and doing nothing . 
And someone who makes a LOLcat has already crossed over that gap . 
Now it 's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis without the LOLcats , right , to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff . 
But media abundance never works that way . 
Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything . 
Even with the sacred printing press , we got erotic novels 150 years before we got scientific journals . 
So before I talk about what is , I think , the critical difference between LOLcats and Ushahidi , I want to talk about their shared source . 
And that source is design for generosity . 
It is one of the curiosities of our historical era that even as cognitive surplus is becoming a resource we can design around , social sciences are also starting to explain how important our intrinsic motivations are to us , how much we do things because we like to do them rather than because our boss told us to do them , or because we 're being paid to do them . 
This is a graph from a paper by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini , who set out to test , at the beginning of this decade , what they called " deterrence theory . " 
And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior : If you want somebody to do less of something , add a punishment and they 'll do less of it . 
Simple , straightforward , commonsensical -- also , largely untested . 
And so they went and studied 10 daycare centers in Haifa , Israel . 
They studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension , which is pick - up time . 
At pick - up time the teachers , who have been with your children all day , would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back . 
Meanwhile , the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work , running late , running errands -- want a little slack to pick the kids up late . 
So Gneezy and Rustichini said , " How many instances of late pick - ups are there at these 10 daycare centers ? " 
Now they saw -- and this is what the graph is , these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals -- that there were between six and 10 instances of late pick - ups on average in these 10 daycare centers . 
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups . 
The white group there is the control group ; they change nothing . 
But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line , they said , " We are changing this bargain as of right now . 
If you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late , we 're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill . 
Boom . No ifs , ands or buts . " 
And the minute they did that , the behavior in those daycare centers changed . 
Late pick - ups went up every week for the next four weeks until they topped out at triple the pre - fine average , and then they fluctuated at between double and triple the pre - fine average for the life of the fine . 
And you can see immediately what happened , right ? 
The fine broke the culture of the daycare center . 
By adding a fine , what they did was communicate to the parents that their entire debt to the teachers had been discharged with the payment of 10 shekels , and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern that the parents owed the teachers . 
And so the parents , quite sensibly , said , " 10 shekels to pick my kid up late ? 
What could be bad ? " 
The explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the 20th century was that we are all rational , self - maximizing actors , and in that explanation -- the daycare center had no contract -- should have been operating without any constraints . 
But that 's not right . 
They were operating with social constraints rather than contractual ones . 
And critically , the social constraints created a culture that was more generous than the contractual constraints did . 
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks -- run the fine for a dozen weeks -- and then they say , " Okay , that 's it . All done ; fine . " 
And then a really interesting thing happens : Nothing changes . 
The culture that got broken by the fine stayed broken when the fine was removed . 
Not only are economic motivations and intrinsic motivations incompatible , that incompatibility can persist over long periods . 
So the trick in designing these kinds of situations is to understand where you 're relying on the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers -- and when you 're relying on the social part of the bargain , when you 're really designing for generosity . 
This brings me back to the LOLcats and to Ushahidi . 
This is , I think , the range that matters . 
Both of these rely on cognitive surplus . 
Both of these design for the assumption that people like to create and we want to share . 
Here is the critical difference between these : LOLcats is communal value . 
It 's value created by the participants for each other . 
Communal value on the networks we have is everywhere -- every time you see a large aggregate of shared , publicly available data , whether it 's photos on Flickr or videos on Youtube or whatever . 
This is good . I like LOLcats as much as the next guy , maybe a little more even , but this is also a largely solved problem . 
I have a hard time envisioning a future in which someone is saying , " Where , oh where , can I find a picture of a cute cat ? " 
Ushahidi , by contrast , is civic value . 
It 's value created by the participants but enjoyed by society as a whole . 
The goals set out by Ushahidi are not just to make life better for the participants , but to make life better for everyone in the society in which Ushahidi is operating . 
And that kind of civic value is not just a side effect of opening up to human motivation . 
It really is going to be a side effect of what we , collectively , make of these kinds of efforts . 
There are a trillion hours a year of participatory value up for grabs . 
That will be true year - in and year - out . 
The number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow , and we can see that organizations designed around a culture of generosity can achieve incredible effects without an enormous amount of contractual overhead -- a very different model than our default model for large - scale group action in the 20th century . 
What 's going to make the difference here is what Dean Kamen said , the inventor and entrepreneur . 
Kamen said , " Free cultures get what they celebrate . " 
We 've got a choice before us . 
We 've got this trillion hours a year . 
We can use it to crack each other up , and we 're going to do that . 
That , we get for free . 
But we can also celebrate and support and reward the people trying to use cognitive surplus to create civic value . 
And to the degree we 're going to do that , to the degree we 're able to do that , we 'll be able to change society . 
Thank you very much .

The tale of a major global cultural phenomenon : Cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle describes the spectacular arrival of fast - paced 20 - 20 cricket as it parallels the rise of modern India . He traces the game from its sleepy English roots to the current world of celebrity owners and million - dollar player contracts .

Harsha Bhogle : The rise of cricket , the rise of India 
So , what I 'm going to do is just give you the latest episode of India 's -- maybe the world 's -- longest running soap opera , which is cricket . 
And may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living . 
It 's got everything that you 'd want a normal soap opera to want : It 's got love , joy , happiness , sadness , tears , laughter , lots of deceit , intrigue . 
And like all good soaps , it jumps 20 years when the audience interest changes . 
And that 's exactly what cricket has done . 
It 's jumped 20 years into 20-over game . 
And that 's what I 'm going to talk about , how a small change leads to a very big revolution . 
But it was n't always like that . 
Cricket was n't always this speed - driven generations game . 
There was a time when you played cricket , you played timeless test matches , when you played on till the game got over . 
And there was this game in March 1939 that started on the third of March and ended on the 14th of March . 
And it only ended because the English cricketers had to go from Durban to Cape Town , which is a two - hour train journey , to catch the ship that left on the 17th , because the next ship was n't around for a long time . 
So , the match was ended in between . 
And one of the English batsmen said , " You know what ? 
Another half an hour and we would have won . " 
Another half an hour after 12 days . 
There were two Sundays in between . But of course , Sundays are church days , so you do n't play on Sundays . And one day it rained , so they all sat around making friends with each other . 
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket : because we had about the same pace of life . 
The Mahabharata was like that as well , was n't it ? 
You fought by day , then it was sunset , so everyone went back home . 
And then you worked out your strategy , and you came and fought the next day , and you went back home again . 
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was that in cricket , everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day . 
Princes patronize the game , not because they love the game , but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves to the British rulers . 
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket , which was , all you needed was a plank of wood and a rubber ball , and any number of people could play it anywhere . 
Take a look : You could play it in the dump with some rocks over there , you could play it in a little alley -- you could n't hit square anywhere , because the bat hit the wall ; do n't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires . 
You could play it on the banks of the Ganges -- that 's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time . 
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you did n't know which game you were actually in . 
As you can see , you can play anywhere . 
But slowly the game moved on , you know , finally . 
You do n't always have five days . So , we moved on , and we started playing 50-over cricket . 
And then an enormous accident took place . 
In Indian sport we do n't make things happen , accidents happen and we 're in the right place at the right time , sometimes . 
And we won this World Cup in 1983 . 
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game , and we played it virtually every day . 
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere . 
But there was another big date . 
1983 was when we won the World Cup . 
1991,'92 , we found a finance minister and a prime minister willing to let the world look at India , rather than be this great country of intrigue and mystery in this closed country . 
And so we allowed multinationals into India . 
We cut customs duties , we reduced import duties , and we got all the multinationals coming in , with multinational budgets , who looked at per - capita income and got very excited about the possibilities in India , and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian . 
And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real , one scripted . 
The scripted one is what you see in the movies , the real one was cricket . 
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me , Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi , decided he 's going to take it all over the world . 
And Pepsi was this big revolution , because they started taking cricket all over . 
And so cricket started becoming big ; cricket started bringing riches in . 
Television started covering cricket . For a long time television said , " We wo n't cover cricket unless you pay us to cover it . " 
Then they said , " OK , the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars . 
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars . " 
So , it 's a bit of a curve , that . 
And then another big accident happened in our cricket . 
England invented 20 overs cricket , and said , " The world must play 20 overs cricket . " 
Just as England invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it . 
Thank God for them . 
And so , India had to go and play the T20 World Cup , you see . 
India did n't want to play the T20 World Cup . 
But we were forced to play it by an 8 - 1 margin . 
And then something very dramatic happened . 
We got to the final , and then this moment , that will remain enshrined forever , for everybody , take a look . 
The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder . 
Announcer : And Zishan takes it ! India wins ! 
What a match for a Twenty20 final . 
India , the world champions . 
India , T20 champions . 
But what a game we had , M. S. Dhoni got it right in the air , but Misbah - ul - Haq , what a player . 
A massive , massive success : India , the world TT champions . 
Harsha Bhogle : Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket . 
The accident , of course , there , was that the batsman thought the bowler was bowling fast . 
If he had bowled fast , the ball would have gone where it was meant to go , but it did n't go . And we suddenly discovered that we could be good at this game . 
And what it also did was it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world . 
It was at a time when investment was coming in , India was feeling a little more confident about itself . 
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride in what we can do . 
And thankfully for all of us , the English are very good at inventing things , and then the gracious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it . 
And so England invented T20 cricket , and allowed India to hijack it . 
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine , we just took it straight away , as is . 
And so , we launched our own T20 league . 
Six weeks , city versus city . 
It was a new thing for us . We had only ever supported our country -- the only two areas in which India was very proud about their country , representing itself on the field . 
One was war , the Indian army , which we do n't like to happen very often . 
The other was Indian cricket . 
Now , suddenly we had to support city leagues . 
But the people getting into these city leagues were people who were taking their cues from the West . 
America is a home of leagues . And they said , " Right , we 'll build some glitzy leagues here in India . " 
But was India ready for it ? 
Because cricket , for a long time in India was always organized . 
It was never promoted , it was never sold -- it was organized . 
And look what they did with our beautiful , nice , simple family game . 
All of a sudden , you had that happening . 
An opening ceremony to match every other . 
This was an India that was buying Corvettes . This was an India that was buying Jaguar . 
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month than New Zealand 's population twice over . 
So , it was a different India . 
But it was also a slightly more orthodox India that was very happy to be modern , but did n't want to say that to people . 
And so , they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived . 
Everyone secretly watched them , but everyone claimed not to . 
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes . 
They were not bureaucrats who were forced into sport because they did n't actually love it ; these were people who ran serious companies . 
And so they started promoting cricket big time , started promoting clubs big time . 
And they 've started promoting them with huge money behind it . 
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars before a ball was bowled , 1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years , and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises that were putting in money . And then they had to appeal to their cities , but they had to do it like the West , right ? Because we are setting up leagues . 
But what they were very good at doing was making it very localized . 
So , just to give you an example of how they did it -- not Manchester United style promotion , but very Mumbai style promotion . Take a look . 
Of course , a lot of people said , " Maybe they dance better than they play . " 
But that 's all right . What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket . 
All along , if you wanted a young cricketer , you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality , your own city , and you were very proud of the system that produced those cricketers . 
Now , all of the sudden , if you were to bowl a shot -- if Mumbai were to bowl a shot , for example , they need n't go to Kalbadevi or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them , they could go to Trinidad . 
This was the new India , was n't it ? This was the new world , where you can source from anywhere as long as you get the best product at the best price . 
And all of a sudden , Indian sport had awakened to the reality that you can source the best product for the best price anywhere in the world . 
So , the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago , overnight . And when he had to go back to represent the West Indies , they asked him , " When do you have to reach ? " 
He said , " I have to be there by a certain time , so I have to leave today . " 
We said , " No , no , no . It 's not about when you have to leave ; it 's about when do you have to reach there ? " 
And so he said , " I 've got to reach on date X. " 
And they said , " Fine , you play to date X , minus one . " 
So , he played in Hyderabad , went , straight after the game , went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport , sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal , second refueling in Brazil ; he was in West Indies in time . 
Never would India have thought on this scale before . 
Never would India have said , " I want a player to play one game for me , and I will use a corporate jet to send him all the way back to Kingston , Jamaica to play a game . " 
And I just thought to myself , " Wow , we 've arrived somewhere in the world , you know ? 
We have arrived somewhere . We are thinking big . " 
But what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment . 
There is cricket and the movies . 
And they came together because people in the movies now started owning clubs . 
And so , people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta . 
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan . 
And something very interesting happened . 
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket . 
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more . 
And of course , if you were on Preity Zinta 's team -- as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well , you got a hug from Preity Zinta . 
So that was the ultimate reason to do well . Take a look -- everyone 's watching Preity Zinta . 
And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd . 
We 'd all seen matches in Kolkata , but we 'd never seen anything like this : Shah Rukh , with the Bengali song , getting the audiences all worked up for Kolkata -- not for India , but for Kolkata . 
But take a look at this . 
An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer because they 'd won in Kolkata . 
Can you imagine ? 
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said ? 
" I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta 's team . " 
But I thought I 'd take this opportunity -- there 's a few people from Pakistan in here . 
I 'm so happy that you 're here because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ? 
We can play cricket together , we can be friends . 
So thank you very much for coming , all of you from Pakistan . 
There was criticism too because they said , " Players are being bought and sold ? 
Are they grain ? 
Are they cattle ? " 
Because we had this auction , you see . 
How do you fix a price for a player ? 
And so the auction that followed literally had people saying , " Bang ! so many million dollars for so - and - so player . " 
There it is . 
Auctioneer : Going at 1,500,000 dollars . Chennai . 
Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars . 
HB : Suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day -- so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 . 
The best Indian players who played every test match -- every one of the internationals , the top of the line players -- standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year . 
Now they were getting 500,000 for six days ' work . 
Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England , he got one and a half million dollars , and he went back and said , " For four weeks , I 'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard , and I 'm earning more than the footballers , wow . " 
And where was he earning it from ? From a little club in India . 
Could you have imagined that day would come ? 
One and a half million dollars for six weeks ' work . 
That 's not bad , is it ? 
So , at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled . 
What India was doing , though , was benchmarking itself against the best in the world , and it became a huge brand . 
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today . 
IPL became the biggest brand in India and , because our elections , had to be moved to South Africa , and we had to start the tournament in three weeks . 
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks . 
But we did it . You know why ? 
Because no country works as slowly as we do till three weeks before an event , and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks . 
Our population , which for a long time we thought was a problem , suddenly became our biggest asset because there were more people watching -- the huge consuming class -- everybody came to watch the cricket . 
We 'd also made cricket the only sport in India , which is a pity , but in India every other sport pushes cricket to become big , which is a bit of a tragedy of our times . 
Now , this last minute before I go -- there 's a couple of side effects of all this . 
For a long time , India was this country of poverty , dust , beggars , snake charmers , filth , Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came . 
And , all of a sudden , India was this land of opportunity . 
Cricketers all over the world said , " You know , we love India . We love to play in India . " 
And that felt good , you know ? 
We said , " The dollar 's quite powerful actually . " 
Can you imagine , you 've got the dollar on view and there 's no Delhi belly in there anymore . 
There 's no filth , there 's no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished , everybody 's gone . This tells you how the capitalist world rules . 
Right so , finally , an English game that India usurped a little bit , but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world . 
If you want to take the game around the world , it 's got to be the shortest form of the game . 
You ca n't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end , or you ca n't take it all over the world . 
So that 's what T20 is doing . 
Hopefully , it 'll make everyone richer , hopefully it 'll make the game bigger and hopefully it 'll give cricket commentators more time in the business . 
Thank you very much . Thank you .

Dan Gilbert on our mistaken expectations 
We all make decisions every day ; we want to know what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic . 
And surely , if somebody could really tell us how to do exactly the right thing at all possible times , that would be a tremendous gift . 
It turns out that , in fact , the world was given this gift in 1738 by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli . 
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is , and I also want to explain to you why it is that it has n't made a damn bit of difference . 
Now , this is Bernoulli 's gift . This is a direct quote . 
And if it looks like Greek to you , it 's because , well , it 's Greek . 
But the simple English translation -- much less precise , but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this : The expected value of any of our actions -- that is , the goodness that we can count on getting -- is the product of two simple things : the odds that this action will allow us to gain something , and the value of that gain to us . 
In a sense , what Bernoulli was saying is , if we can estimate and multiply these two things , we will always know precisely how we should behave . 
Now , this simple equation , even for those of you who do n't like equations , is something that you 're quite used to . 
Here 's an example : if I were to tell you , let 's play a little coin toss game , and I 'm going to flip a coin , and if it comes up heads , I 'm going to pay you 10 dollars , but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me , most of you would say , sure , I 'll take that bet . Because you know that the odds of you winning are one half , the gain if you do is 10 dollars , that multiplies to five , and that 's more than I 'm charging you to play . So , the answer is , yes . 
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet . 
Now , the idea is simple when we 're applying it to coin tosses , but in fact , it 's not very simple in everyday life . 
People are horrible at estimating both of these things , and that 's what I want to talk to you about today . 
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do , and those are errors in estimating the odds that they 're going to succeed , and errors in estimating the value of their own success . 
Now , let me talk about the first one first . 
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy : there are six sides to a die , two sides to a coin , 52 cards in a deck . 
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades or of flipping a heads . 
But as it turns out , this is not a very easy idea to apply in everyday life . That 's why Americans spend more -- I should say , lose more -- gambling than on all other forms of entertainment combined . 
The reason is , this is n't how people do odds . 
The way people figure odds requires that we first talk a bit about pigs . 
Now , the question I 'm going to put to you is whether you think there are more dogs or pigs on leashes observed in any particular day in Oxford . 
And of course , you all know that the answer is dogs . 
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you 've seen dogs and pigs on leashes . 
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs , not so easy to remember pigs . And each one of you assumed that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind , then dogs on leashes are more probable . 
That 's not a bad rule of thumb , except when it is . 
So , for example , here 's a word puzzle . 
Are there more four - letter English words with R in the third place or R in the first place ? 
Well , you check memory very briefly , make a quick scan , and it 's awfully easy to say to yourself , Ring , Rang , Rung , and very hard to say to yourself , Pare , Park : they come more slowly . 
But in fact , there are many more words in the English language with R in the third than the first place . 
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind is n't because they 're improbable , unlikely or infrequent . 
It 's because the mind recalls words by their first letter . 
You kind of shout out the sound , S -- and the word comes . 
It 's like the dictionary ; it 's hard to look things up by the third letter . 
So , this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray . It 's not just puzzles , though . 
For example , when Americans are asked to estimate the odds that they will die in a variety of interesting ways -- these are estimates of number of deaths per year per 200 million U.S. citizens . 
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked to guess how many people die from tornado , fireworks , asthma , drowning , etc . 
Compare these to the actual numbers . 
Now , you see a very interesting pattern here , which is first of all , two things are vastly over - estimated , namely tornadoes and fireworks . 
Two things are vastly underestimated : dying by drowning and dying by asthma . Why ? 
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper and the headline was , " Boy dies of Asthma ? " 
It 's not interesting because it 's so common . 
It 's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances of news stories or newsreels where we 've seen tornadoes devastating cities , or some poor schmuck who 's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July . 
Drownings and asthma deaths do n't get much coverage . 
They do n't come quickly to mind , and as a result , we vastly underestimate them . 
Indeed , this is kind of like the Sesame Street game of " Which thing does n't belong ? " And you 're right to say it 's the swimming pool that does n't belong , because the swimming pool is the only thing on this slide that 's actually very dangerous . 
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination of all three of the others that you see on the slide . 
The lottery is an excellent example , of course -- an excellent test - case of people 's ability to compute probabilities . 
And economists -- forgive me , for those of you who play the lottery -- but economists , at least among themselves , refer to the lottery as a stupidity tax , because the odds of getting any payoff by investing your money in a lottery ticket are approximately equivalent to flushing the money directly down the toilet -- which , by the way , does n't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything . 
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery ? 
Well , there are many answers , but one answer surely is , we see a lot of winners . Right ? When this couple wins the lottery , or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you cash things that size , I do n't know . 
We see this on TV ; we read about it in the paper . 
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost ? 
Indeed , if we required that television stations run a 30-second interview with each loser every time they interview a winner , the 100 million losers in the last lottery would require nine - and - a - half years of your undivided attention just to watch them say , " Me ? I lost . " " Me ? I lost . " 
Now , if you watch nine - and - a - half years of television -- no sleep , no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss , and then at the end there 's 30 seconds of , " and I won , " the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small . 
Look , I can prove this to you : here 's a little lottery . 
There 's 10 tickets in this lottery . 
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals . 
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and , if you win , you get 20 bucks . Is this a good bet ? 
Well , Bernoulli tells us it is . 
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars ; this is a lottery in which you should invest your money . 
And most people say , " OK , I 'll play . " 
Now , a slightly different version of this lottery : imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named Leroy . 
Leroy has nine tickets ; there 's one left . 
Do you want it ? Most people wo n't play this lottery . 
Now , you can see the odds of winning have n't changed , but it 's now fantastically easy to imagine who 's going to win . 
It 's easy to see Leroy getting the check , right ? 
You ca n't say to yourself , " I 'm as likely to win as anybody , " because you 're not as likely to win as Leroy . 
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy changes your decision to play , even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds . 
Now , estimating odds , as difficult as it may seem , is a piece of cake compared to trying to estimate value : trying to say what something is worth , how much we 'll enjoy it , how much pleasure it will give us . 
I want to talk now about errors in value . 
How much is this Big Mac worth ? Is it worth 25 dollars ? 
Most of you have the intuition that it 's not -- you would n't pay that for it . 
But in fact , to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one , and only one question , which is : What else can I do with 25 dollars ? 
If you 've ever gotten on one of those long - haul flights to Australia and realized that they 're not going to serve you any food , but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened the McDonald 's bag , and the smell of golden arches is wafting over the seat , you think , I ca n't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours . 
I ca n't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter ! 
Suddenly , 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal . 
On the other hand , if you 're visiting an underdeveloped country , and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal , it 's exorbitant for a Big Mac . 
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no , before I 'd even told you anything about the context ? 
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac to the price you 're used to paying . Rather than asking , " What else can I do with my money , " comparing this investment to other possible investments , you compared to the past . 
And this is a systematic error people make . 
What you knew is , you paid three dollars in the past ; 25 is outrageous . 
This is an error , and I can prove it to you by showing the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads . 
For example , this is , of course , one of the most delicious tricks in marketing , is to say something used to be higher , and suddenly it seems like a very good deal . 
When people are asked about these two different jobs : a job where you make 60 K , then 50 K , then 40 K , a job where you 're getting a salary cut each year , and one in which you 're getting a salary increase , people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact they 're all told they make much less money . Why ? 
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages , even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period . Here 's another nice example . 
Here 's a $ 2,000 Hawaiian vacation package ; it 's now on sale for 1,600 . 
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii , would you buy this package ? 
Most people say they would . Here 's a slightly different story : $ 2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars , so you decide to mull it over for a week . 
By the time you get to the ticket agency , the best fares are gone -- the package now costs 1,500 . Would you buy it ? Most people say , no . 
Why ? Because it used to cost 700 , and there 's no way I 'm paying 1,500 for something that was 700 last week . 
This tendency to compare to the past is causing people to pass up the better deal . In other words , a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal . 
Here 's another example of how comparing to the past can befuddle our decisions . 
Imagine that you 're going to the theater . 
You 're on your way to the theater . 
In your wallet you have a ticket , for which you paid 20 dollars . 
You also have a 20-dollar bill . 
When you arrive at the theater , you discover that somewhere along the way you 've lost the ticket . 
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it ? 
Most people answer , no . 
Now , let 's just change one thing in this scenario . 
You 're on your way to the theater , and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills . 
When you arrive you discover you 've lost one of them . 
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket ? 
Well , of course , I went to the theater to see the play . 
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do ? 
Now , just in case you 're not getting it , here 's a schematic of what happened , OK ? 
Along the way , you lost something . 
In both cases , it was a piece of paper . 
In one case , it had a U.S. president on it ; in the other case it did n't . 
What the hell difference should it make ? 
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself , I 'm not paying twice for the same thing . 
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars -- to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it 's a bad deal . 
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems that behavioral economists and psychologists identify in people 's attempts to assign value . 
But even when we compare with the possible , instead of the past , we still make certain kinds of mistakes . 
And I 'm going to show you one or two of them . 
One of the things we know about comparison : that when we compare one thing to the other , it changes its value . 
So in 1992 , this fellow , George Bush , for those of us who were kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum , did n't seem like such a great guy . 
Suddenly , we 're almost longing for him to return . 
The comparison changes how we evaluate him . 
Now , retailers knew this long before anybody else did , of course , and they use this wisdom to help you -- spare you the undue burden of money . 
And so a retailer , if you were to go into a wine shop and you had to buy a bottle of wine , and you see them here for eight , 27 and 33 dollars , what would you do ? 
Most people do n't want the most expensive , they do n't want the least expensive . 
So , they will opt for the item in the middle . 
If you 're a smart retailer , then , you will put a very expensive item that nobody will ever buy on the shelf , because suddenly the $ 33 wine does n't look as expensive in comparison . 
So I 'm telling you something you already knew : namely , that comparison changes the value of things . 
Here 's why that 's a problem : the problem is that when you get that $ 33 bottle of wine home , it wo n't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to . 
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value , where we 're trying to estimate how much we 'll like things , are not the same comparisons we 'll be making when we consume them . 
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil our attempts to make rational decisions . 
Let me just give you an example . 
I have to show you something from my own lab , so let me sneak this in . 
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions : How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now ? 
They 're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them . 
For some of the subjects , sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of Godiva chocolates , and for others is a can of Spam . 
In fact , these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they 're going to enjoy the potato chips . 
Namely , those who are looking at Spam think potato chips are going to be quite tasty ; those who are looking at Godiva chocolate think they wo n't be nearly so tasty . 
Of course , what happens when they eat the potato chips ? 
Well , look , you did n't need a psychologist to tell you that when you have a mouthful of greasy , salty , crispy , delicious snacks , what 's sitting in the corner of the room makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience . 
Nonetheless , their predictions are perverted by a comparison that then does not carry through and change their experience . 
You 've all experienced this yourself , even if you 've never come into our lab to eat potato chips . So here 's a question : You want to buy a car stereo . 
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars , but if you drive across town , you can get it for 100 bucks . 
So would you drive to get 50 percent off , saving 100 dollars ? 
Most people say they would . 
They ca n't imagine buying it for twice the price when , with one trip across town , they can get it for half off . 
Now , let 's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo , and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000 . 
But if you drove across town , you could get it for 30,900 . 
Would you drive to get it ? At this point , 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars . 
Most people say , no , I 'm going to schlep across town to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car ? 
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy , and it should . 
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello ! -- does n't know where it came from . 
It does n't know what you saved it on . 
When you go to buy groceries with it , it does n't go , I 'm the money saved on the car stereo , or , I 'm the dumb money saved on the car . It 's money . 
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it 's worth 100 bucks no matter what you 're saving it on . People do n't think that way . 
That 's why they do n't know whether their mutual fund manager is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment , but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste . 
Now , you can see , this is the problem of shifting comparisons , because what you 're doing is , you 're comparing the 100 bucks to the purchase that you 're making , but when you go to spend that money you wo n't be making that comparison . 
You 've all had this experience . 
If you 're an American , for example , you 've probably traveled in France . 
And at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown , and you thought , " Oh , my God , these people are so warm . They 're so nice to me . 
I mean , compared to all these people who hate me when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I do n't , these people are just wonderful . " And so you tour France with them , and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner , and what do you find ? 
Compared to your regular friends , they are boring and dull , right ? Because in this new context , the comparison is very , very different . In fact , you find yourself disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship . 
Now , you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo . 
You go to the stereo store , you see two sets of speakers -- these big , boxy , monoliths , and these little , sleek speakers , and you play them , and you go , you know , I do hear a difference : the big ones sound a little better . 
And so you buy them , and you bring them home , and you entirely violate the décor of your house . 
And the problem , of course , is that this comparison you made in the store is a comparison you 'll never make again . 
What are the odds that years later you 'll turn on the stereo and go , " Sounds so much better than those little ones , " which you ca n't even remember hearing . 
The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult when these choices are arrayed over time . 
People have a lot of trouble making decisions about things that will happen at different points in time . 
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered is that by and large people use two simple rules . 
So let me give you one very easy problem , a second very easy problem and then a third , hard , problem . 
Here 's the first easy problem : You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now . Which would you prefer ? 
This is what we call a one - item IQ test , OK ? 
All of us , I hope , prefer more money , and the reason is , we believe more is better than less . 
Here 's the second problem : You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month . Which would you prefer ? 
Again , an easy decision , because we all know that now is better than later . 
What 's hard in our decision - making is when these two rules conflict . 
For example , when you 're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month . 
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain by waiting , but you have to be patient . 
What do we know ? What do people do in these kinds of situations ? 
Well , by and large people are enormously impatient . 
That is , they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars . 
Maybe that is n't so remarkable , but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing when the delivery of these monetary units will happen . 
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that 's 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months . 
What do we find now ? 
People are gladly willing to wait : as long as they 're waiting 12 , they might as well wait 13 . 
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen ? 
Comparison . Troubling comparison . Let me show you . 
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested you would show if I gave you time to respond , which is , people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher than the subjective value of 60 when they 'll be delivered in now or one month , respectively -- a 30-day delay -- but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision off into the future a year . 
Now , why in the world do you get this pattern of results ? 
These guys can tell us . 
What you see here are two lads , one of them larger than the other : the fireman and the fiddler . 
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon , and I want you to notice two things . 
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler . No point . 
However , the difference between them seems to be getting smaller . 
First it 's an inch in your view , then it 's a quarter - inch , then a half - inch , and then finally they go off the edge of the earth . 
Here are the results of what I just showed you . 
This is the subjective height -- the height you saw of these guys at various points . 
And I want you to see that two things are true . 
One , the farther away they are , the smaller they look ; and two , the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler . 
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear . Right . 
At a very close distance , the fiddler looks taller than the fireman , but at a far distance their normal , their true , relations are preserved . 
As Plato said , what space is to size , time is to value . 
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you : 60 now or 50 in a month ? 
And these are subjective values , and what you can see is , our two rules are preserved . 
People always think more is better than less : 60 is always better than 50 , and they always think now is better than later : the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side . 
Watch what happens when we drop some out . 
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us . 
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now over waiting a month , but not if that decision is far in the future . 
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely , that when people get to the future , they will change their minds . 
That is , as that month 12 approaches , you will say , what was I thinking , waiting an extra month for 60 dollars ? 
I 'll take the 50 dollars now . 
Well , the question with which I 'd like to end is this : If we 're so damn stupid , how did we get to the moon ? 
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence of people 's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value . 
The answer to this question , I think , is an answer you 've already heard in some of the talks , and I dare say you will hear again : namely , that our brains were evolved for a very different world than the one in which we are living . 
They were evolved for a world in which people lived in very small groups , rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves , had rather short lives in which there were few choices and the highest priority was to eat and mate today . 
Bernoulli 's gift , Bernoulli 's little formula , allows us , it tells us how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us . 
That explains why we are so bad at using it , but it also explains why it is so terribly important that we become good , fast . 
We are the only species on this planet that has ever held its own fate in its hands . 
We have no significant predators , we 're the masters of our physical environment ; the things that normally cause species to become extinct are no longer any threat to us . 
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us are our own decisions . 
If we 're not here in 10,000 years , it 's going to be because we could not take advantage of the gift given to us by a young Dutch fellow in 1738 , because we underestimated the odds of our future pains and overestimated the value of our present pleasures . 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : That was remarkable . 
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert . One and two . 
Bill Lyell : Would you say that this mechanism is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us , and is there some way that we could counteract that ? 
Dan Gilbert : I actually was consulting recently with the Department of Homeland Security , which generally believes that American security dollars should go to making borders safer . 
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people 's psychological reaction to a set of events , and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified , rather than -- not rather than , but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we 're all concerned about . 
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to -- and forgive me , but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents . 
We already know , for example , in the United States , more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes -- because they were scared -- and driving on highways , than were killed in 9/11 . OK ? 
If I told you that there was a plague that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year , you might be alarmed if you did n't find out it was the flu . 
These are small - scale accidents , and we should be wondering whether they should get the kind of play , the kind of coverage , that they do . 
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood that they 'll be hurt in these various ways , and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us . 
CA : Dan , I 'd like to hear more on this . So , you 're saying that our response to terror is , I mean , it 's a form of mental bug ? 
Talk more about it . 
DG : It 's out - sized . I mean , look . 
If Australia disappears tomorrow , terror is probably the right response . 
That 's an awful large lot of very nice people . On the other hand , when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed , more people than that were killed by not using their seatbelts in the same country . 
Is terror the right response ? 
CA : What causes the bug ? Is it the drama of the event -- that it 's so spectacular ? 
Is it the fact that it 's an intentional attack by , quote , outsiders ? 
What is it ? 
DG : Yes . It 's a number of things , and you hit on several of them . 
First , it 's a human agent trying to kill us -- it 's not a tree falling on us by accident . 
Second , these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again . 
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there 's good reason , but sometimes people think there are . 
So there are a number of things that together make this seem like a fantastic event , but let 's not play down the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it they want to read . So there 's a large role here played by the media , who want these things to be as spectacular as they possibly can . 
CA : I mean , what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it ? 
DG : Well , go to Israel . You know , go to Israel . And a mall blows up , and then everybody 's unhappy about it , and an hour - and - a - half later -- at least when I was there , and I was 150 feet from the mall when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel and the wedding that was planned was still going on . 
And as the Israeli mother said , she said , " We never let them win by stopping weddings . " 
I mean , this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it , shall I say , as those of us who have not had many terror attacks . 
CA : But is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we 're frightened about this is because we think that the Big One is to come ? 
DG : Yes , of course . So , if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be , there might be more and more buses of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened . 
I do n't want to say -- please , I 'm going to get quoted somewhere as saying , " Terrorism is fine and we should n't be so distressed . " 
That 's not my point at all . 
What I 'm saying is that , surely , rationally , our distress about things that happen , about threats , should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats and threats to come . 
I think in the case of terrorism , it is n't . 
And many of the things we 've heard about from our speakers today -- how many people do you know got up and said , Poverty ! I ca n't believe what poverty is doing to us . 
People get up in the morning ; they do n't care about poverty . 
It 's not making headlines , it 's not making news , it 's not flashy . 
There are no guns going off . 
I mean , if you had to solve one of these problems , Chris , which would you solve ? Terrorism or poverty ? 
That 's a tough one . 
CA : There 's no question . 
Poverty , by an order of magnitude , a huge order of magnitude , unless someone can show that there 's , you know , terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come . 
The latest I 've read , seen , thought is that it 's incredibly hard for them to do that . 
If that turns out to be wrong , we all look silly , but with poverty it 's a bit -- DG : Even if that were true , still more people die from poverty . 
CA : We 've evolved to get all excited about these dramatic attacks . Is that because in the past , in the ancient past , we just did n't understand things like disease and systems that cause poverty and so forth , and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy into worrying about those things ? 
People died ; so be it . 
But if you got attacked , that was something you could do something about . 
And so we evolved these responses . 
Is that what happened ? 
DG : Well , you know , the people who are most skeptical about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything are the evolutionary psychologists themselves . 
My guess is that there 's nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past . But rather , if you 're looking for an evolutionary explanation , you might say that most organisms are neo - phobic -- that is , they 're a little scared of stuff that 's new and different . 
And there 's a good reason to be , because old stuff did n't eat you . Right ? 
Any animal you see that you 've seen before is less likely to be a predator than one that you 've never seen before . 
So , you know , when a school bus is blown up and we 've never seen this before , our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated . 
I do n't think it 's quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to , but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it . 
Jay Walker : You know , economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets . But I suspect you 're making the exact same error you 're accusing those people of , which is the error of value . 
I know , because I 've interviewed about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years . 
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning . 
That 's what you think it is . All right ? 
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year , so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose , and yet she buys 150 tickets a year . Why is that ? 
It 's not because she is stupid or he is stupid . 
It 's because the anticipation of possibly winning releases serotonin in the brain , and actually provides a good feeling until the drawing indicates you 've lost . 
Or , to put it another way , for the dollar investment , you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money down the toilet , which you can not have a good feeling from . 
Now , economists tend to -- -- economists tend to view the world through their own lenses , which is : this is just a bunch of stupid people . 
And as a result , many people look at economists as stupid people . 
And so fundamentally , the reason we got to the moon is , we did n't listen to the economists . Thank you very much . 
DG : Well , no , it 's a great point . It remains to be seen whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled by the amount of disappointment after the lottery . Because remember , people who did n't buy tickets do n't feel awful the next day either , even though they do n't feel great during the drawing . 
I would disagree that people know they 're not going to win . 
I think they think it 's unlikely , but it could happen , which is why they prefer that to the flushing . 
But certainly I see your point : that there can be some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning . 
Now , I think there 's many good reasons not to listen to economists . 
That is n't one of them , for me , but there 's many others . 
CA : Last question . 
Aubrey de Grey : My name 's Aubrey de Grey , from Cambridge . 
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills -- I work on aging -- and I 'm interested in doing something about it , as we 'll all hear tomorrow . 
I very much resonate with what you 're saying , because it seems to me that the problem with getting people interested in doing anything about aging is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer or heart disease or whatever . Do you have any advice ? 
DG : For you or for them ? 
AdG : In persuading them . 
DG : Ah , for you in persuading them . 
Well , it 's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted . 
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly . 
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future and the near future is that we imagine the near future much more vividly than the far future . 
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail that people put into the mental representations of near and far future , people begin to make decisions about the two in the same way . 
So , would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you 're 65 is a question that 's very different than , imagine who you 'll be when you 're 65 : will you be living , what will you look like , how much hair will you have , who will you be living with . 
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario , suddenly we feel like it might be important to save so that that guy has a little retirement money . 
But these are tricks around the margins . 
I think in general you 're battling a very fundamental human tendency , which is to say , " I 'm here today , and so now is more important than later . " 
CA : Dan , thank you . Members of the audience , that was a fantastic session . Thank you .

Mike Matas : A next - generation digital book 
So for the past year and a half , my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature - length interactive book . 
It 's called " Our Choice " and the author is Al Gore . 
It 's the sequel to " An Inconvenient Truth , " and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis . 
The book starts like this . This is the cover . 
As the globe spins , we can see our location , and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book . 
Or , we can scroll through the pages at the bottom . 
And if we wanted to zoom into a page , we can just open it up . 
And anything you see in the book , you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up . 
And if you want to go back and read the book again , you just fold it back up and put it back on the page . 
And so this works the same way ; you pick it up and pop it open . 
Al Gore : I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they 're a beautiful addition to the landscape . 
Mike Matas : And so throughout the whole book , Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos . 
This photo , you can you can even see on an interactive map . 
Zoom into it and see where it was taken . 
And throughout the book , there 's over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations . 
So you can open this one . 
AG : Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ... 
MM : It starts playing immediately . 
And while it 's playing , we can pinch and peak back at the page , and the movie keeps playing . 
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents , and the video keeps playing . 
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics . 
This one shows the wind potential all around the United States . 
But instead of just showing us the information , we can take our finger and explore , and see , state by state , exactly how much wind potential there is . 
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power . 
This is one of my favorites . 
So this shows ... 
When the wind is blowing , any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery . 
And as the wind starts dying down , any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out . 
And this whole book , it does n't just run on the iPad . 
It also runs on the iPhone . 
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone . 
And it works the exact same way . 
You can pinch into any page . 
Open it up . 
So that 's Push Pop Press ' first title , Al Gore 's " Our Choice . " 
Thank you . 
Chris Anderson : That 's spectacular . 
Do you want to be a publisher , a technology licenser ? 
What is the business here ? 
Is this something that other people can do ? 
MM : Yeah , we 're building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content . 
So Melcher Media 's team , who 's on the East coast -- and we 're on the West coast , building the software -- takes our tool and , every day , drags in images and text . 
CA : So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that ? 
All right . Mike , thanks so much . 
MM : Thank you .

Milton Glaser on using design to make ideas new 
' Theme and variations ' is one of those forms that require a certain kind of intellectual activity , because you are always comparing the variation with the theme that you hold in your mind . 
You might say that the theme is nature and everything that follows is a variation on the subject . 
I was asked , I guess about six years ago , to do a series of paintings that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca . 
And it was very difficult for me to imagine how to paint pictures that were based on Piero until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature -- that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree . 
And that was enormously liberating to me . 
Perhaps it 's not a very insightful observation , but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations based on a work by Piero , in this case that remarkable painting that 's in the Uffizi , " The Duke of Montefeltro , " who faces his consort , Battista . 
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject , I did the following series of drawings . 
That 's the real Piero della Francesca -- one of the greatest portraits in human history . 
And these , I 'll just show these without comment . 
It 's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro , who 's a great , great figure in the Renaissance , and probably the basis for Machiavelli 's " The Prince . " 
He apparently lost an eye in battle , which is why he is always shown in profile . 
And this is Battista . 
And then I decided I could move them around a little bit -- so that for the first time in history , they 're facing the same direction . 
Whoops ! Passed each other . 
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero , this is from " The Resurrection of Christ " -- as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat . 
And now , four large panels : this is upper left ; upper right ; lower left ; lower right . 
Incidentally , I 've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism . 
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with there does n't seem to be an argument there . 
On another subject -- -- I was driving in the country one day with my wife , and I saw this sign , and I said , " That is a fabulous piece of design . " 
And she said , " What are you talking about ? " 
I said , " Well , it 's so persuasive , because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage , and since most people are so suspicious of garages , and know that they 're going to be ripped off , they use the word ' reliable . ' But everybody says they 're reliable . 
But , reliable Dutchman " -- -- " Fantastic ! " 
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman -- which is an archaic word , nobody calls Dutch people " Dutchmen " anymore -- but as soon as you hear Dutchman , you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike , preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland , and so on . 
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of " Dutchman . " 
Now , if you think I 'm exaggerating at all in this , all you have to do is substitute something else , like " Indonesian . " 
Or even " French . " 
Now , " Swiss " works , but you know it 's going to cost a lot of money . 
I 'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster . 
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts , where I teach , and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes -- often gives you a piece of text and he says , " Do something with this . " 
And so he did . 
And this was the text -- " In words as fashion the same rule will hold/ Alike fantastic if too new or old/ Be not the first by whom the new are tried/ Nor yet the last to lay the old aside . " 
I could make nothing of that . 
And I really struggled with this one . 
And the first thing I did , which was sort of in the absence of another idea , was say I 'll sort of write it out and make some words big , and I 'll have some kind of design on the back somehow , and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something . 
So I took another crack at it -- you 've got to keep it moving -- and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper and I pasted them down on an ugly board . 
I thought that something would come out of it , like " Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope " because it 's by Alexander Pope , but I sort of made a mess out of it , and then I thought I 'd repeat it in some way so it was legible . 
So , it was going nowhere . 
Sometimes , in the middle of a resistant problem , I write down things that I know about it . 
But you can see the beginning of an idea there , because you can see the word " new " emerging from the " old . " 
That 's what happens . 
There 's a relationship between the old and the new ; the new emerges from the context of the old . 
And then I did some variations of it , but it still was n't coalescing graphically at all . 
I had this other version which had something interesting about it in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues . 
The W was clearly a W , the N was clearly an N , even though they were very fragmentary and there was n't a lot of information in it . 
Then I got the words " new " and " old " and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return . 
I was really desperate at this point . 
And so , I do something I 'm truthfully ashamed of , which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose and I put them together . 
It says " dreams " at the top . 
And I was going to do a thing , I say , " Well , change the copy . 
Let it say something about dreams , and come to SVA and you 'll sort of fulfill your dreams . " 
But , to my credit , I was so embarrassed about doing that that I never submitted this sketch . 
And , finally , I arrived at the following solution . 
Now , it does n't look terribly interesting , but it does have something that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters . 
For one thing , it transgresses the idea of what a poster 's supposed to be , which is to be understood and seen immediately , and not explained .
